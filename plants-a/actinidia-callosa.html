                <h1>Actinidia callosa</h1>
<p>Actinidia callosa, commonly known as the Chinese mayapple, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Actinidia callosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia callosa has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually 5â€“10 cm long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows as a climbing vine with tendrils. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a greenish-yellow, berry-like drupe that ripens in late summer, dispersing primarily by birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia callosa is primarily native to Assam, China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, Malaya, Myanmar, Nepal, Sumatera, Taiwan, Tibet, Vietnam, West Himalaya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate to subtropical regions across these areas. This plant typically grows in forested areas and mountainous regions with moist, well-drained soils. It is well adapted to the diverse climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Actinidia callosa is a valued species for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia callosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in natural ecosystems. The plant competes with native vegetation and can alter habitat structure.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
