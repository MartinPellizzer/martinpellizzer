                <h1>Achillea dentatoserrata</h1>
<p>Achillea dentatoserrata, commonly known as the serrated yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely toothed, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea dentatoserrata has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged in a rosette, and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, typically with a gray-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread and survival.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dentatoserrata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Europe and Australia. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of concern in some regions, though its conservation status is generally stable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea dentatoserrata is a hardy perennial known for its finely cut, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring good drainage and warmth for successful germination. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering to avoid root rot.</p>
<p>Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage new growth. While generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper air circulation and organic treatments.</p>
<p>It pairs well with lavender, thyme, and other drought-tolerant perennials in garden beds.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea dentatoserrata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native flora to enhance overall garden health. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates, supporting a broader ecological network.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
