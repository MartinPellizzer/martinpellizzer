<p>Aspidium irriguum, commonly known as the Irish water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous cover.</p>
<p>Aspidium irriguum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
