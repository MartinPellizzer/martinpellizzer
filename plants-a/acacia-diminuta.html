                    <h1>Acacia diminuta</h1>
<p>Acacia diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf acacia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. Acacia diminuta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
