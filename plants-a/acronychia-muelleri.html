                <h1>Acronychia muelleri</h1>
<p>Acronychia muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is typically found in tropical rainforests. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses by Indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia muelleri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops fissures with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and they bloom during the wet season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a spherical, woody drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia muelleri is primarily native to northern Queensland and eastern New South Wales in Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rainforests, particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions of these states. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with humid, shaded environments. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, known for its distinctive foliage and ecological importance in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acronychia muelleri is an important component of the understory vegetation in coastal and rainforest habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia muelleri was mainly introduced to the eastern and northern regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal and inland rainforests. This plant is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and is often seen growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded areas. Its introduction has been largely due to natural dispersal through wind and animal activity.</p>
<p>It is now considered a widespread native species in these regions.</p>
