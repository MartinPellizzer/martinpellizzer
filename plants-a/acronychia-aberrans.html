                <h1>Acronychia aberrans</h1>
<p>Acronychia aberrans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae, native to northern Australia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries.</p>
<p>Acronychia aberrans is typically found in coastal regions and is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia aberrans has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grey to brown in color. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia aberrans is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in rainforests and along riverbanks. It is commonly found in the northeastern part of Queensland.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia aberrans was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in coastal and tropical regions of northern Australia. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
