                    <h1>Arisaema murrayi var. murrayi</h1>
<p>Arisaema murrayi var. murrayi, commonly known as the Murray's arisaema, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like bracts that encase the spadix, a central spiky structure typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with a greenish-yellow spathe that opens to reveal the spadix. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
