<p>Asplenium herbstii, commonly known as the autumn fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds that remain lush throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense, ground-covering mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are characterized by their delicate, arching shape and are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value.</p>
