                        <h1>Acaena sericea var. latifoliolata</h1>
<p>Acaena sericea var. latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are broad and serrated, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. This species thrives in coastal and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sericea var. latifoliolata is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northern and central regions of the country. This variety thrives in a variety of habitats, including forest margins, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is often associated with the lower North Island and parts of the South Island.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sericea var. latifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species with similar ecological characteristics. This variety is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins due to its adaptability. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, contributing to local plant communities.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited compared to other introduced Acaena species.</p>
