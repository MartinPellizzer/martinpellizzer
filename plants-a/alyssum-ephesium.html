<p>It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture and resist heat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Alyssum ephesium is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and hoverflies.</p>
