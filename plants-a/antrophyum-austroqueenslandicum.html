                    <h1>Antrophyum austroqueenslandicum</h1>
<p>Antrophyum austroqueenslandicum, commonly known as the Queensland antarctic palm, is a rare and unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of over two meters. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and evolutionary studies.</p>
