<p>Amomum palustre, commonly known as marsh cardamom, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their fragrant properties, though they are less commercially valuable than those of other ginger species.</p>
<p>Amomum palustre thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats.</p>
