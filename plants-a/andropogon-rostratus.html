<p>Andropogon rostratus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, blue or purple flowers in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in native habitats.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and drought tolerance.</p>
