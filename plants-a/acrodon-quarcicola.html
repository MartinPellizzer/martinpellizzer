                    <h1>Acrodon quarcicola</h1>
<p>Acrodon quarcicola, commonly known as the quartz-hair moss, is a rare and unique species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like structures that give it its scientific name, with "quarcicola" suggesting its association with quartz-like environments. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often on rocky substrates or in crevices where moisture is retained. Its morphology includes slender, branching stems with small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of translucent cells.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, Acrodon quarcicola is considered a specialist species with limited distribution.</p>
