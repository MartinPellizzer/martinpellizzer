<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>flabellatum, commonly known as the Campbell's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It is relatively slow-growing and tolerant of cold climates, making it suitable for temperate gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is largely due to its distinctive foliage and autumn coloration.</p>
