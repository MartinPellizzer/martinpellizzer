<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>flabellatum, commonly known as the Campbell's maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes make it a standout in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>flabellatum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a flabellate shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 15 cm in length. The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to its native mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>flabellatum is a rare and ornamental maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to various botanical gardens and collections around the world, particularly in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where cool and humid conditions prevail. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>flabellatum is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>flabellatum is a rare and ornamental maple known for its unique, palmate leaves and slow growth. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This species has a slow growth cycle, making it suitable for small spaces and container gardening.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with heathers or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>
