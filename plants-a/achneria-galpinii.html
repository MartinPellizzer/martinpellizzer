                <h1>Achneria galpinii</h1>
<p>Achneria galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's achneria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria galpinii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria galpinii is primarily native to the southern regions of Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Karoo and semi-arid areas of the country. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in shrubland or on rocky outcrops. It is commonly associated with the fynbos vegetation type, which is characteristic of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria galpinii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland fynbos vegetation. This plant is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with wet winters and dry summers. It is also found in some parts of Namibia and southern Angola.</p>
