                    <h1>Amphirhapis wightiana</h1>
<p>Amphirhapis wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to the Malayan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically male and female on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its cones, which develop after flowering, are woody and contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphirhapis wightiana is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
