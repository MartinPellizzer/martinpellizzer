                <h1>Adonis aethiopica</h1>
<p>Adonis aethiopica, commonly known as the Ethiopian glory of the snow, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces striking, showy yellow flowers with a red-tipped center, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis aethiopica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they are relatively small, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat woody with a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent yellow petals and a central yellow disk, blooming in early spring, and they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots that help the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis aethiopica is primarily native to North Africa, particularly countries such as Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Middle East, including southern Turkey and western Iran. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in mountainous areas and along coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes scrublands, grasslands, and open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis aethiopica was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in fynbos habitats, often outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and high reproductive capacity. The plant's introduction is largely attributed to human activity, including the dumping of garden waste and accidental transport through trade. Its spread has led to ecological concerns, as it can alter soil nutrient levels and reduce biodiversity in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread through manual removal and chemical treatments in affected regions.</p>
