                <h1>Achillea trilingulata</h1>
<p>Achillea trilingulata, commonly known as the three-lobed yarrow, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads that are typically white to pale pink in color. Its leaves are finely divided and gray-green, with a distinctive silvery appearance.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea trilingulata has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a dark green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and grows in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding pink to red disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea trilingulata is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is commonly found in rocky soils and open landscapes. This plant is also native to parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria, where it adapts to similar climatic conditions. It is often seen in grasslands, coastal areas, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to other regions but remains most prevalent in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea trilingulata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
