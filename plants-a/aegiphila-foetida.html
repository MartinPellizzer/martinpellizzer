                <h1>Aegiphila foetida</h1>
<p>Aegiphila foetida, commonly known as the stinking beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and it has distinctive, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Aegiphila foetida plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila foetida has small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, bark-like texture, typically ranging from gray to brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>
