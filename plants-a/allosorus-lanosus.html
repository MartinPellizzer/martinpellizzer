<p>Allosorus lanosus, commonly known as the woolly allosorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Allosorus lanosus is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
