                <h1>Adenoplea lindleyana</h1>
<p>Adenoplea lindleyana, commonly known as the Lindley's adenoplea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance.</p>
<p>Adenoplea lindleyana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoplea lindleyana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoplea lindleyana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to regions with a warm climate and high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoplea lindleyana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its introduction has been associated with horticultural trade and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native flora.</p>
