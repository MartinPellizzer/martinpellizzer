                    <h1>Asclepias verdickii</h1>
<p>Asclepias verdickii, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Asclepias verdickii plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
