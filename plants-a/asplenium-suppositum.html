<p>Asplenium suppositum, commonly known as the False Bird's Nest, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a rosette-shaped growth pattern with dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or near streams.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and compact size make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings.</p>
