                <h1>Acer langii</h1>
<p>Acer langii, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which features striking red, yellow, or orange leaves in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated edge and a smooth upper surface.</p>
<p>Acer langii thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer langii has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length; they are bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellowish-green sepals and no petals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer langii is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in southwest China.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat consists of moist, shaded forests at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is severely restricted, with only a few remaining populations in fragmented forest areas. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Acer langii is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer langii is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Acer langii involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer langii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer langii supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different seasons.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer langii is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The tree contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture, supporting industries that rely on its aesthetic appeal. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in traditional Chinese practices and is often appreciated for its role in biodiversity and landscape aesthetics.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also highlights its importance in maintaining environmental balance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer langii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Orange Queen' and 'Kosher,' which are known for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer langii are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance, cold hardiness, and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, particularly in gardens and landscapes where autumn foliage is a key feature.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them important in the cultivation of ornamental trees.</p>
