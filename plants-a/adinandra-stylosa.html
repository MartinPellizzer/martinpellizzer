                <h1>Adinandra stylosa</h1>
<p>Adinandra stylosa, commonly known as the African velvetwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by black, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and durable timber, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra stylosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops vertical fissures as the plant matures, and it grows as a shrub with a compact, upright form. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the sandy soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra stylosa is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, typically in primary and secondary tropical rainforests. Its distribution extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Adinandra stylosa is also occasionally reported in some Pacific islands, though its presence there is less common.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra stylosa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia, where it has established itself in natural and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is required to prevent its spread into native habitats.</p>
