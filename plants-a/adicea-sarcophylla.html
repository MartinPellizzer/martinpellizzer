                <h1>Adicea sarcophylla</h1>
<p>Adicea sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces edible fig-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. Adicea sarcophylla thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea sarcophylla has simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape, with a waxy green color and a slightly serrated margin, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea sarcophylla is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and hammocks. This plant is well adapted to the humid climate and seasonal flooding typical of its native habitat. It is often associated with wetland ecosystems and can be found in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea sarcophylla was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun exposure and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, construction sites, and abandoned fields. Its introduction has led to its spread in regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
