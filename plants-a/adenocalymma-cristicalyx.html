                <h1>Adenocalymma cristicalyx</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma cristicalyx, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its flowers are typically clustered in panicles. It is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its striking floral display and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in full sun and its relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cristicalyx has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cristicalyx is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of Pernambuco, Paraíba, and Ceará. This plant thrives in the tropical and subtropical climates of the area. It is commonly found in open areas such as savannas and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of the northeastern Brazilian landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cristicalyx was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a common sight in beach environments. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several regions, though it is not considered invasive.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
