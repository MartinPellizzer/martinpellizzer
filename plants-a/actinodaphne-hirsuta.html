                <h1>Actinodaphne hirsuta</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy actinodaphne, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its aromatic wood and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hirsuta has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, blooming in clusters during the rainy season, and is pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hirsuta is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, typically in primary and secondary tropical rainforests. It is also occasionally recorded in parts of southern China and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hirsuta was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fragrant leaves. This species has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in local ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological consequences.</p>
