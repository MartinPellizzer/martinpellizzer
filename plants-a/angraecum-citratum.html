                    <h1>Angraecum citratum</h1>
<p>Angraecum citratum, commonly known as the citron orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and its unique, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in winter. The plant produces long, slender inflorescences with showy, white or pale yellow blossoms that emit a strong citrus-like scent. Angraecum citratum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
