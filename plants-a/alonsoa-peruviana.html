<p>Alonsoa peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Alonsoa peruviana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
