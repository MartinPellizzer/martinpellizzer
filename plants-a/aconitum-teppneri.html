                <h1>Aconitum teppneri</h1>
<p>Aconitum teppneri, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue-violet to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, requiring caution during handling and cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum teppneri has leaves that are compound, with palmate or pinnate divisions, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is usually erect, with a smooth, dark brown bark that is somewhat rough to the touch. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a tall spire-like structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its native environment.</p>
