<p>Atriplex turbinata, commonly known as the bearded saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adaptations such as succulent leaves and a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Atriplex turbinata is also used in rehabilitation of degraded lands due to its hardy nature.</p>
