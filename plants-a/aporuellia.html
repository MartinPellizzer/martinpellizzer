                    <h1>Aporuellia</h1>
<p>Aporuellia, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes other stinging plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Aporuellia is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on most members of the genus.</p>
