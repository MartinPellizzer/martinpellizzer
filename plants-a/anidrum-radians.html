                    <h1>Anidrum radians</h1>
<p>Anidrum radians, commonly known as the radiant anidrum, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its reproductive system relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungal species found in the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Anidrum radians is now classified as critically endangered.</p>
