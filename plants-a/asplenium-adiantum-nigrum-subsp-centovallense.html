<p>Asplenium adiantum-nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>centovallense, commonly known as the Italian maidenhair fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its more widespread relatives.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Adiantum genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
