<p>Ajax minor var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf ajax, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
