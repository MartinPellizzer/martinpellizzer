                        <h1>Acantholimon schirazianum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon schirazianum, commonly known as the Schirazian's thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon schirazianum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternating generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with showy flowers and often contains species adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, characterized by their often blue or purple flowers. Its genus is Acantholimon, a genus of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, known for their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon schirazianum, a specific plant species native to certain regions of the Middle East, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon schirazianum is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in high-altitude areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon schirazianum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and high altitudes, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with limited rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is commonly found in the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia, where it has adapted to the harsh climate. Its introduction to these regions is largely due to its ability to survive in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is not native to these areas and has been spread through human activity.</p>
