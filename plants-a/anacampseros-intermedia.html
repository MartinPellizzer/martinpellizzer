                    <h1>Anacampseros intermedia</h1>
<p>Anacampseros intermedia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anacampseros intermedia is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
