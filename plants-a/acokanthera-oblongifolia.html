                <h1>Acokanthera oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Acokanthera oblongifolia, commonly known as the African arrow poison or the poison arrow tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical or oblong leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids in its roots and stems, which have been used traditionally for poison arrows.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera oblongifolia has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy green in color, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle, containing numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor firmly in the soil and access water from deeper layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera oblongifolia is primarily native to the Cape Provinces, KwaZulu-Natal, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the region's subtropical and tropical climates. It typically grows in dense forests and along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the moist and humid conditions of these areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera oblongifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions where the climate is temperate and moist. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
