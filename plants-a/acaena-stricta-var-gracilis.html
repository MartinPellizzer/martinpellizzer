                        <h1>Acaena stricta var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Acaena stricta var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender burrplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiny bracts that form the characteristic burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
