                <h1>Acidocroton pilosulus</h1>
<p>Acidocroton pilosulus, commonly known as the hairy croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, often lobed shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant contains various chemical compounds, some of which have been studied for potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton pilosulus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, longitudinal strips, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the dry season, likely relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton pilosulus is primarily native to the island of New Guinea and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas of these regions. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often encountered in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the eastern and western regions of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton pilosulus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and elevated sites, often as a result of human activities such as land clearing and agriculture.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is commonly found in open woodlands and along forest edges. The plant has been reported in several regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, where it has become naturalized. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and its rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
