<p>Aegiphila herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila herzogii has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
