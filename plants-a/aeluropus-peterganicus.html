<p>Aeluropus peterganicus, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. This plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in saline and drought-prone soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in a fine layer of wax, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Aeluropus peterganicus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
