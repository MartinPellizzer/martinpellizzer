                <h1>Aeluropus peterganicus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus peterganicus, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. This plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in saline and drought-prone soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in a fine layer of wax, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Aeluropus peterganicus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus peterganicus has grass-like leaves that are narrow, blade-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and grows upright, with a light green color and a smooth surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikes, with a greenish-white color, and they bloom in the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The plant produces small, dry fruits called caryopses, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to stabilize in sandy or saline soils.</p>
