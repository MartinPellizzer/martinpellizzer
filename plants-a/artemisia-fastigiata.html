                    <h1>Artemisia fastigiata</h1>
<p>Artemisia fastigiata, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Artemisia fastigiata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
