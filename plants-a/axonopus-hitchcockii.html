<p>Axonopus hitchcockii, commonly known as Hitchcock's axonopus, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bright green and may have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
