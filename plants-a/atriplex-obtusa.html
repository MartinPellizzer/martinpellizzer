                    <h1>Atriplex obtusa</h1>
<p>Atriplex obtusa, commonly known as bluntleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, salt-excreting hairs, a feature common among members of the Chenopodiaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in saline and drought-prone soils, making it an important species in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex obtusa is also valued for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, contributing to its role in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
