                <h1>Acetosella multicaulis</h1>
<p>Acetosella multicaulis, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Acetosella multicaulis is often found growing in rocky or calcareous soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosella multicaulis has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and it grows in a compact, low form. The flowers are tiny, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosella multicaulis is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe, particularly in the British Isles and parts of northern Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes scattered populations in the UK, Ireland, and some regions of mainland Europe, though it is rare and often localized. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, heaths, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acetosella multicaulis is considered a conservation concern and is listed as a vulnerable species in several European countries.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosella multicaulis is a low-growing, evergreen plant known for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by division, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acetosella multicaulis is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in early spring and continuing throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while pruning dead or damaged leaves in late winter helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its ornamental value and create a lush, shaded garden space.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acetosella multicaulis is a low-growing flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its foliage and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecological settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acetosella multicaulis can act as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acetosella multicaulis is a small, flowering plant commonly found in moist, shaded areas, known for its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it can be foraged in some regions for its edible leaves, though it is not a staple food. In traditional medicine, it has been used in certain cultures for its potential diuretic and antiseptic properties. Industrially, it plays a minor role in ecological systems by supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often associated with woodland environments and may hold symbolic significance in local folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acetosella multicaulis has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Roseum' and 'Albiflora', which are known for their striking white and pink flowers.</p>
<p>While there are no widely recognized hybrids of Acetosella multicaulis, it is often crossed with other species within the genus to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in shaded environments and their ability to spread through runners, making them suitable for ground cover.</p>
<p>Their compact growth habit and colorful foliage make them popular choices for rock gardens and woodland gardens.</p>
