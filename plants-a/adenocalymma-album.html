<p>Adenocalymma album, commonly known as the white adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded areas.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma album has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains thin and unbroken throughout the plant's growth.

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma album was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its white flowers attracting pollinators. It has been introduced to several countries in Africa and the Middle East for ecological and agricultural purposes.</p>
