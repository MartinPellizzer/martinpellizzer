                <h1>Adesmia calopogon</h1>
<p>Adesmia calopogon, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small lanterns. The plant is a climbing vine with opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia calopogon has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and typically measure around 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender, somewhat woody, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, growing in a climbing or trailing manner. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself while absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia calopogon is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species is commonly found in areas with high moisture levels and acidic soils. It is often associated with pine flatwoods and other forested wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia calopogon was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in prairie and open woodland habitats. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and habitat modification.</p>
