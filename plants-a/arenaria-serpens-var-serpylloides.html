<p>Arenaria serpens var. serpylloides, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a hardy ground cover.</p>
