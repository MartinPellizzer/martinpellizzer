                    <h1>Angraecum straussii</h1>
<p>Angraecum straussii, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific species of hawkmoths for pollination. The plant has a compact, pseudobulb-like structure with broad, leathery leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in high-altitude, humid conditions with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its unique pollination mechanism and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
