                    <h1>Alectorolophus pampaninii</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus pampaninii, commonly known as the Pampas lichen, is a unique lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying on photosynthesis through its symbiotic association with algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, such as the Pampas grasslands of South America.</p>
