<p>Asparagus karthikeyanii, commonly known as the Karthikeyan asparagus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of southern India, particularly the Western Ghats, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is characterized by its ability to form dense clumps and has a slow growth rate, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
