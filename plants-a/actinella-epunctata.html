                <h1>Actinella epunctata</h1>
<p>Actinella epunctata, commonly known as the punctate actinella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant has narrow, linear leaves arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella epunctata has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a pale green bark that becomes rough as the plant matures. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella epunctata is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in forested areas, particularly in the lower elevations. It is often associated with wet or moist environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within New Zealand's native flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella epunctata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions, particularly in areas with mild climates and well-drained soils. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed habitats has contributed to its spread. It is often found in gardens, along roadsides, and in urban areas.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
