                    <h1>Athyrium × undulatipinnulum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × undulatipinnulum, commonly known as the undulating fern, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, undulating fronds that give it a delicate and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
