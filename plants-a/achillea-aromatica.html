                <h1>Achillea aromatica</h1>
<p>Achillea aromatica, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pinkish in color. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and produces a strong, aromatic scent. It typically grows in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Sweet yarrow is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aromatica has basal, aromatic leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy form. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aromatica is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution also includes areas in North Africa and the Middle East, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils in open habitats like grasslands, coastal areas, and mountain slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Achillea aromatica is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions, though it is not currently listed as endangered globally.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aromatica is a hardy perennial herb known for its fragrant foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division, stem cuttings, or seeds, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining its ornamental qualities. This plant has a growth cycle that begins in early spring with new growth, followed by flowering in mid to late summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its form and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or yarrow can enhance its growth and provide a beautiful, fragrant garden display.</p>
