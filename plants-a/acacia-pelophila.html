                        <h1>Acacia pelophila</h1>
<p>Acacia pelophila, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, showing tolerance to salt spray and drought.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia pelophila belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a secondary cell wall and complex structures such as stomata. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often having spore-producing structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a specific arrangement of parts. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees found mainly in arid regions, known for their distinctive phyllodes and often for their ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia pelophila, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>
