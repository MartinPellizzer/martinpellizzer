                    <h1>Aeridostachya crassipes</h1>
<p>Aeridostachya crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features robust, grass-like leaves that are typically broad and flat, adapted to thrive in moist environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
