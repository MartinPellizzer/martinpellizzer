                    <h1>Asplenium contiguum</h1>
<p>Asplenium contiguum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, rock crevices, and along streams. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white茸毛. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium contiguum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
