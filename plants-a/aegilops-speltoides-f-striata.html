                    <h1>Aegilops speltoides f. striata</h1>
<p>Aegilops speltoides f. striata, commonly known as the striated wild wheat, is a diploid wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear awned florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. It is known for its genetic diversity and has been studied for its potential in wheat improvement programs.</p>
<p>Its genome contributes to the genetic resources available for breeding more resilient wheat varieties.</p>
