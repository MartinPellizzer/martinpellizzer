                    <h1>Aplophyllum decurrens</h1>
<p>Aplophyllum decurrens, commonly known as the creeping rock pepper, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Aplophyllum decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
