                <h1>Achyranthes persica</h1>
<p>Achyranthes persica, commonly known as Persian knotweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The roots of Achyranthes persica are thick and fleshy, and they contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes persica has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 3 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes rough with age, and it grows upright with a slightly woody texture. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in spikes, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes persica is primarily native to southern and southeastern Asia, including regions such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of China.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly seen in open areas, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Its native range extends to the Indian subcontinent and the Indochina region.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes persica was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and California.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive red flowers and its ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant has since spread beyond its initial introduction sites, becoming naturalized in several regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing study and management.</p>
