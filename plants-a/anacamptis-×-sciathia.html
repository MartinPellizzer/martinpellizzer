<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant produces a dense, spike-like inflorescence with numerous small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming colonies over time.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Anacamptis × sciathia make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable component of its native habitats.</p>
