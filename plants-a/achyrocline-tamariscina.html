                <h1>Achyrocline tamariscina</h1>
<p>Achyrocline tamariscina, commonly known as Tamarillo or Yellow Tamarillo, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and oval-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit, which is edible, has a sweet and tangy flavor, making it a popular crop in some parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline tamariscina has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are usually serrated, green on top, and slightly paler underneath, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light green to grayish bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline tamariscina is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal areas or near mangroves. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and can thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>Its native range includes several islands in the West Indies where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline tamariscina was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it disrupts local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further harm to native flora.</p>
