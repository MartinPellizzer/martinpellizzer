<p>Aegilops crithodium, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Aegilops crithodium is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops crithodium has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear, arranged in a basal rosette, and have a bluish-green color with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, growing from the base and reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of two to four florets, each with a pale blue to purple color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-angled capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with seeds that are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
