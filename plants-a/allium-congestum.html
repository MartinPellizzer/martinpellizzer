                    <h1>Allium congestum</h1>
<p>Allium congestum, commonly known as the clustered garlic or swamp garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and forms dense colonies through rhizomes, making it a persistent groundcover. Its bulbs are similar to garlic but are generally smaller and less aromatic.</p>
<p>Allium congestum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms.</p>
