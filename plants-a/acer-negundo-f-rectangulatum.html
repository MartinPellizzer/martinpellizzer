                <h1>Acer negundo f. rectangulatum</h1>
<p>Acer negundo f. rectangulatum, commonly known as the box elder maple, is a variant of the box elder tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, rectangular-shaped leaves, which distinguish it from the broader leaves of the typical box elder. The plant is native to North America and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. rectangulatum has elongated, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually darker green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind; the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. rectangulatum is a variant of the box elder tree, originally native to the central and eastern regions of North America.</p>
<p>While it is now widely cultivated and introduced in various parts of the world, including Europe and Asia, its natural distribution is limited. It thrives in temperate environments, often found in riparian zones, along riverbanks, and in moist, well-drained soils. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is not currently listed as endangered, but its conservation status remains largely stable in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. rectangulatum is a unique cultivar of the box elder tree known for its distinct rectangular-shaped leaves and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This fast-growing tree thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil, requiring regular watering during its establishment phase. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may be susceptible to aphids and leaf spot, making companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or rosemary helpful in deterring pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. rectangulatum is a fast-growing, nitrogen-fixing tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are a food source for birds and small mammals. It acts as an effective companion plant in reforestation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The tree also contributes to improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a significant ecological role in supporting biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. rectangulatum is a variant of the box elder tree known for its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically used in small-scale woodworking and furniture making. In traditional medicine, some parts of the plant have been used for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Culturally, it is often planted in urban landscapes for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in polluted environments.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological restoration and as a windbreak makes it valuable in environmental management.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. rectangulatum has several popular cultivars that are favored for their unique leaf shapes and ornamental value, such as 'Aureum' with its yellow foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It is also involved in various hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the genus. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness or more vibrant fall color. Horticulturally, Acer negundo f. rectangulatum is valued for its adaptability to urban environments and its ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids play an important role in landscaping and ornamental horticulture.</p>
