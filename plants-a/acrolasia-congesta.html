                <h1>Acrolasia congesta</h1>
<p>Acrolasia congesta, commonly known as the clustered acrolasia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acrolasia congesta is typically found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia congesta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia congesta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in shaded environments and is often associated with moist, well-drained soils. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Acrolasia congesta is an important component of the understory vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia congesta was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy environments where it establishes quickly. The plant spreads through its extensive root system and can colonize bare ground efficiently. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, its aggressive growth may lead to competition with native flora in some regions.</p>
