                <h1>Adesmia capricornu</h1>
<p>Adesmia capricornu, commonly known as the Capricorn bean, is a small, deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy pods and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant's growth habit and morphology make it well adapted to dry, disturbed habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia capricornu has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly woody texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia capricornu is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands. This plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not commonly found outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia capricornu was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and habitat integrity.</p>
