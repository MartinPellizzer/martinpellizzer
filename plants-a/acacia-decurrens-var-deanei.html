                        <h1>Acacia decurrens var. deanei</h1>
<p>Acacia decurrens var. deanei, commonly known as the Deane's wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which appear during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia decurrens var. deanei is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy soils and open woodlands. This variant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen in association with other native shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia decurrens var. deanei was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils. This plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which enhance soil fertility. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for land rehabilitation efforts.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
