<p>Agelaea paradoxa var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf agelaea, is a unique and rare plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, clustered flowers that bloom in a striking shade of violet. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. This variety is notable for its unusual morphology, which includes a short, thick stem and reduced leaf size compared to other members of the genus.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and scientific interest.</p>
