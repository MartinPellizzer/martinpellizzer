<p>Agrostis myriantha var. yangbiensis, commonly known as the Yangbi hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Yunnan province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
