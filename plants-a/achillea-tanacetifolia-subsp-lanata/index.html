<p>Lanate yarrow, scientifically known as Achillea tanacetifolia subsp. lanata, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This perennial plant is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. With its historical use in traditional medicine and its ornamental value, lanate yarrow has garnered attention among botanists and gardeners alike. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a fascinating subject for both ecological study and horticultural appreciation.</p>
