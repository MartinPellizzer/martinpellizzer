                    <h1>Acacia nitidula</h1>
<p>Acacia nitidula, commonly known as the smooth acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stem and small, bipinnate leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that appear in summer, followed by flat, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia nitidula is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening.</p>
