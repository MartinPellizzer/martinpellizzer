                    <h1>Arundo wilhelmsii</h1>
<p>Arundo wilhelmsii, commonly known as the Mexican reed or reed canarygrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and can grow up to 4 meters in height, forming dense stands. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native habitats if not managed properly.</p>
