                    <h1>Armeria maritima var. villosa</h1>
<p>Armeria maritima var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and rocky shorelines.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens.</p>
