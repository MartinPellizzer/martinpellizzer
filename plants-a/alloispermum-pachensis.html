<p>Alloispermum pachensis, commonly known as the Pachicola mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for avian species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Alloispermum pachensis is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
