<p>Arctostaphylos tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteosa madrone, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, woolly leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, leathery berries that are edible for some wildlife but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its bract-like structures beneath the flowers, which are a key identifying feature.</p>
