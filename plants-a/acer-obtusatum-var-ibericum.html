                <h1>Acer obtusatum var. ibericum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. ibericum has palmately lobed leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a wavy margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red or purple in autumn; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. ibericum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically Spain.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to the southern regions of Spain, where it thrives in rocky and mountainous environments. Currently, its distribution is restricted to a few isolated locations, primarily in the Sierra de Grazalema and Sierra de Cazorla. It grows at altitudes between 700 and 1,500 meters, preferring sunny slopes and limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat degradation, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. ibericum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering more reliable results. The growth cycle of this species involves a period of slow growth in early spring, followed by rapid development during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. ibericum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a healthy microhabitat, promoting overall ecological balance in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. ibericum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal preparations.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications, with some studies suggesting it may possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In terms of industrial and economic value, it is not widely utilized, but its ornamental qualities make it a candidate for horticultural and landscaping purposes. Culturally, it may hold significance in local traditions or as a symbol of regional biodiversity.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and ornamental than in other major applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. ibericum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aconitifolium' and 'Sutherlandii', which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety also serves as a parent in various hybrids, contributing to the development of other maple species with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its vibrant autumn colors and foliage variations. Horticulturists often use it to create genetic diversity in maple collections.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, it remains a sought-after plant in both public and private landscapes.</p>
