                <h1>Aconitum tsangpoense</h1>
<p>Aconitum tsangpoense, commonly known as the Tsangpo aconite, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Tibet and western Yunnan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces large, palmately lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its roots are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids such as aconitine, making it a dangerous plant to handle.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments with cool, temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tsangpoense has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a dark brown to reddish-brown bark that is slightly rough in texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and a showy hooded structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tsangpoense is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and China.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude areas of these countries, particularly in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. This plant thrives in moist, cool, and shaded environments, often growing in mountainous regions with rich soil. It is commonly found in forests and grasslands at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tsangpoense was mainly introduced to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in regions of Bhutan, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, temperate climates at high altitudes, often found in forested areas and along riverbanks. This species is known for its striking blue or purple flowers, which make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It has also been introduced to parts of China and Southeast Asia, where it is cultivated for both its aesthetic value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, its natural range remains largely confined to the regions of its native origin.</p>
