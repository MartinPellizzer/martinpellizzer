                    <h1>Aconitum tsangpoense</h1>
<p>Aconitum tsangpoense, commonly known as the Tsangpo aconite, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Tibet and western Yunnan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces large, palmately lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its roots are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids such as aconitine, making it a dangerous plant to handle.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments with cool, temperate climates.</p>
