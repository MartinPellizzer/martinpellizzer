<p>Aspidium subspinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered with small, spiny structures called spinules. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Aspidium subspinulosum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
