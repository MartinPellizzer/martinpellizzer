<p>Aloe, commonly known as the aloe vera plant, is a succulent belonging to the Asphodelaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant's gel-like substance inside the leaves is widely used for its soothing and healing properties. Aloe typically produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the end of its stems.</p>
<p>It is native to Africa but is now cultivated in many parts of the world for both ornamental and medicinal purposes.</p>
