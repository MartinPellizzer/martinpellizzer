                    <h1>Arnica terrae-novae</h1>
<p>Arnica terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfoundland arnica, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal heaths and bogs. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Arnica terrae-novae is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is generally less commercially cultivated than other arnica species.</p>
