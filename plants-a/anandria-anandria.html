<p>Anandria anandria, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a white bud that unfolds into a pink or red flower. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Anandria anandria is revered in many cultures for its symbolic and spiritual significance.</p>
