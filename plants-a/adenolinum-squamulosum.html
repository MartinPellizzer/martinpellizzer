                <h1>Adenolinum squamulosum</h1>
<p>Adenolinum squamulosum, commonly known as the squamulous adenolinum, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often hairy or scaly leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent structure. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or green, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a plant of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum squamulosum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a rough, grayish bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum squamulosum is primarily native to the southern regions of Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal areas and grasslands of the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen growing in open, sunny environments. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Mozambique and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum squamulosum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, gardens, and abandoned lands. The plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes and seeds, which can be carried by wind, water, or animals. Due to its adaptability, it has become invasive in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
