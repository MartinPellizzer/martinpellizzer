<p>Alopecurus lasiochlamys, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>Alopecurus lasiochlamys is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
