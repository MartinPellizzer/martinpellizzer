                <h1>Aciotis aquatica</h1>
<p>Aciotis aquatica, commonly known as waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Aciotis aquatica thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its ability to adapt to aquatic conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis aquatica has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green to slightly reddish color, growing upright with a spreading habit. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in moist soils and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis aquatica is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant is commonly found in the Pantanal wetlands, which are among the largest tropical wetlands in the world. Its distribution also extends to parts of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Aciotis aquatica plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing food and shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis aquatica was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in wetland areas.</p>
<p>It was originally from South America and was brought to other regions for ecological restoration purposes. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist environments and has been used in wetland rehabilitation projects. However, it has also shown potential to become invasive in some areas if not properly managed.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding in several regions where it was introduced.</p>
