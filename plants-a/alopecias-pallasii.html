                    <h1>Alopecias pallasii</h1>
<p>Alopecias pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas's lichen, is a type of crustose lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus that forms a dense, compact layer on surfaces such as soil, bark, or stone. The lichen contains a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to photosynthesize and survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is often found in temperate and subarctic regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, Alopecias pallasii is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
