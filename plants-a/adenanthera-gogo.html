                <h1>Adenanthera gogo</h1>
<p>Adenanthera gogo, commonly known as the African burr bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Adenanthera gogo is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera gogo has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a flat, elongated legume that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera gogo is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in open woodlands. This plant thrives in coastal and semi-arid environments, often growing in dune systems and on sandy ridges. It is well adapted to the warm, dry climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Adenanthera gogo is also found in some parts of southern New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera gogo was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in coastal environments. The plant is also used for soil stabilization and has been planted along roadsides and in degraded areas. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and seed dispersal make it a challenging species to control in natural habitats.</p>
