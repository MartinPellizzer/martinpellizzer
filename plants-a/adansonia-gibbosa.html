                <h1>Adansonia gibbosa</h1>
<p>Adansonia gibbosa, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a striking deciduous tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has large, palmate leaves and produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a fibrous capsule that contains edible seeds, which are used in various traditional and modern culinary applications.</p>
<p>The baobab is also culturally significant to the people of Madagascar and is often revered as a sacred tree.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia gibbosa has large, bipinnate leaves that are compound, with a feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 1 to 3 meters in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, trunk-like, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, growing in a straight, upright pattern. The flowers are large, showy, and white or pale yellow, with a complex structure consisting of multiple petals and stamens, blooming from November to February, and are pollinated by bats and insects. The fruit is a woody, spherical capsule that splits open to release numerous small, fibrous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the tree to anchor itself and absorb water from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia gibbosa is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and arid regions of the island, particularly in the southern and western parts. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen growing in open woodlands and savannas. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adansonia gibbosa is also known as the baobab tree and is a symbol of the unique flora of Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia gibbosa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, typically found in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where it can receive ample sunlight and has access to adequate water during the growing season. This species is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. It is also used in reforestation projects in parts of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range can sometimes lead to ecological imbalances if not managed carefully.</p>
