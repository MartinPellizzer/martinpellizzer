<p>Adansonia gibbosa, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a striking deciduous tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has large, palmate leaves and produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a fibrous capsule that contains edible seeds, which are used in various traditional and modern culinary applications.</p>
<p>The baobab is also culturally significant to the people of Madagascar and is often revered as a sacred tree.</p>
