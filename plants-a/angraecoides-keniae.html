<p>Angraecoides keniae, commonly known as the Kenia orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, fleshy leaf. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with long, slender petals and sepals, and a distinctive, spurred labellum.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angraecoides keniae is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in botanical collections.</p>
