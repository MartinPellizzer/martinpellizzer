                <h1>Acronia baezensis</h1>
<p>Acronia baezensis, commonly known as the Baez Mountain acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia baezensis has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 8 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia baezensis is primarily native to the island of Baez, located in the southern part of the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>This species is found in the humid tropical forests of the island, where it thrives in the warm and moist climate. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in shaded undergrowth. The plant is endemic to this region, meaning it does not occur naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia baezensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions with mild winters and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries in Europe and parts of North America where it has established itself in gardens and disturbed soils. The plant thrives in sunny locations and is often found near human settlements. Its introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to different soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
