                    <h1>Azolla japonica</h1>
<p>Azolla japonica, commonly known as Japanese water fern, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, water-filled fronds that allow it to float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant forms dense mats that can cover ponds and slow-moving streams, often leading to oxygen depletion in the water. Azolla japonica has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which resides in the cavities of its leaves and fixes atmospheric nitrogen.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant in natural nitrogen cycling and a potential biofertilizer in agriculture.</p>
