<p>Asplenium grammitis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clusters of narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and slightly curled. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium grammitis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings.</p>
