                            <h1>Achras Excelsa</h1>
<p>Achras tree, scientifically known as Achras excelsa, is a towering member of the Arecaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. This majestic plant can grow up to 30 meters tall, making it one of the tallest palm species in the world. Its trunk is thick and covered in a fibrous, spongy layer that provides structural support and water storage. The tree produces large, yellowish flowers followed by edible, white, fleshy fruits that are highly valued in local cuisines. Due to its ecological importance and unique characteristics, the Achras tree is a remarkable symbol of biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
