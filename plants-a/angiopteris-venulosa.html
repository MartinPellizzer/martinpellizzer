                    <h1>Angiopteris venulosa</h1>
<p>Angiopteris venulosa, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
