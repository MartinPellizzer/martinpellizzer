                            <h1>Aconitum Prutense</h1>
<p>Aconitum prutense is a striking member of the buttercup family known for its tall, spire-like flower clusters. Native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments. Its vivid blue or purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators and adding dramatic flair to gardens. Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be deadly if ingested. Due to its danger, it is often cultivated with caution and care.</p>
