                    <h1>Acer floridanum f. platylobum</h1>
<p>Acer floridanum f. platylobum, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a rare and unique variant of the maple tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple during the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
