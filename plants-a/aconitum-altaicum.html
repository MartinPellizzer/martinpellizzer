                    <h1>Aconitum altaicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum altaicum, commonly known as the Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces achenes (dry, one-seeded fruits) that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its colonization of alpine environments. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>Aconitum altaicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its striking floral display.</p>
