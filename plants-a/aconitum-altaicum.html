                <h1>Aconitum altaicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum altaicum, commonly known as the Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces achenes (dry, one-seeded fruits) that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its colonization of alpine environments. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>Aconitum altaicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum altaicum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in tall, spikelike clusters, with showy, spurred petals and a short blooming period in late summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum altaicum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau, and parts of Mongolia.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,500 meters. This species is commonly found in rocky soils and among grasslands in these high-altitude areas. It is also present in the Russian Far East and extends into northern China.</p>
<p>Aconitum altaicum is well adapted to cold climates and is often associated with other high-altitude flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum altaicum was mainly introduced to regions with moist, temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 3 through 7, making it suitable for cooler climates. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers. It prefers partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
