<p>Asplenium ocanniense, commonly known as the Ocani's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium ocanniense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
