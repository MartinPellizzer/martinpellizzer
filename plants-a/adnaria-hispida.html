                <h1>Adnaria hispida</h1>
<p>Adnaria hispida, commonly known as the hairy adnara, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adnaria hispida is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria hispida has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, hairy texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with tubular petals and yellow-orange coloration, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria hispida is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly on rocky shores and cliffs. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often associated with maritime environments. It is also present in some islands of the western Mediterranean, such as Sardinia and Corsica.</p>
<p>Adnaria hispida is a hardy species that has adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria hispida was mainly introduced to coastal areas and estuaries where it can thrive in brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with muddy or sandy substrates, often near tidal zones. The plant's introduction has been linked to human activities such as shipping and the release of aquatic plants from aquariums or ornamental trade. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
