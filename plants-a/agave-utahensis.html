<p>Agave utahensis, commonly known as the Utah agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is well adapted to dry climates and can store water in its leaves and stem.</p>
<p>Agave utahensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
