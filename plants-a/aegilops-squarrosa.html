                <h1>Aegilops squarrosa</h1>
<p>Aegilops squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, bristly leaves and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Aegilops squarrosa is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has potential for use in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops squarrosa has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, with a blue-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a greenish color, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its flowers are spike-like, with small, pale blue to purple florets, blooming in early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in dry, sandy soils.</p>
