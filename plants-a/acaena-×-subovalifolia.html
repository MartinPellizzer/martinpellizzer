<p>It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It is often seen in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena × subovalifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena crassipes and Acaena subovalifolia, both native to New Zealand.
