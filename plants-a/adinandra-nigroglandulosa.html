                <h1>Adinandra nigroglandulosa</h1>
<p>Adinandra nigroglandulosa, commonly known as the black-gland adenandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is a shrub or small tree, characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature.</p>
<p>Adinandra nigroglandulosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra nigroglandulosa has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree.

The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra nigroglandulosa is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained soils. The species is commonly associated with secondary forests and mixed evergreen-deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra nigroglandulosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in areas with moist, tropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland forests, often growing in shaded understory conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its fragrant flowers and attractive foliage. It has been introduced for horticultural purposes, though its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns.</p>
