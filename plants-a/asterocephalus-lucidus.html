<p>Asterocephalus lucidus, commonly known as the shining starhead, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which appear in late spring. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Asterocephalus lucidus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought.</p>
