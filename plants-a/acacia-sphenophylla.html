                    <h1>Acacia sphenophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia sphenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia sphenophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
