                    <h1>Aquilegia desertorum</h1>
<p>Aquilegia desertorum, commonly known as the desert columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, purple, and yellow, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces seed pods that split open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
