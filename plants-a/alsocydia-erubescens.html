                    <h1>Alsocydia erubescens</h1>
<p>Alsocydia erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>The berries are an important food source for birds, which help in seed dispersal.</p>
