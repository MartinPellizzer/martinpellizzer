<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Aluta appressa is known for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
