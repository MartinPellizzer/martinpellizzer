<p>Anisotes ukambensis, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the sediment.</p>
<p>Anisotes ukambensis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
