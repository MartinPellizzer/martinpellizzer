<p>Arisarum vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>subexertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of the broader-leaved subspecies.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a spadix, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role as an ornamental plant in gardens and as a component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
