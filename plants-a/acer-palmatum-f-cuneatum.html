<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. cuneatum is a rare variant of the Japanese maple known for its distinctive cuneate leaf shape.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan, it thrives in temperate climates with high humidity. While originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
