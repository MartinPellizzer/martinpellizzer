<p>Astragalus radicans, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields.</p>
<p>Astragalus radicans plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
