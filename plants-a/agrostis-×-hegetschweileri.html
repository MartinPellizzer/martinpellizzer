                    <h1>Agrostis × hegetschweileri</h1>
<p>Agrostis × hegetschweileri, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil conditions. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
