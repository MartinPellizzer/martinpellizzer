                <h1>Acronia calogramma</h1>
<p>Acronia calogramma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with long, white, strap-shaped leaves and a single, fragrant flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia calogramma has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white to pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia calogramma is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions in southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, particularly in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry, sunny environments. Its distribution extends to parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria, as well as the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Acronia calogramma is adapted to the climate of these regions, which are characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia calogramma was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and beach habitats. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecosystem disruption and loss of biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to monitor and control its spread in affected regions.</p>
