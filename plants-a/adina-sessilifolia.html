                <h1>Adina sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Adina sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf adina, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Adina sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina sessilifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, clustered in axillary inflorescences, and they bloom during the spring and early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina sessilifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Adina sessilifolia is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina sessilifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
