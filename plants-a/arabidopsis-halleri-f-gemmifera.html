                    <h1>Arabidopsis halleri f. gemmifera</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis halleri f. gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous rockcress, is a variant of the Arabidopsis halleri species, which belongs to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules that allow for asexual reproduction. It typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The leaves are usually basal, with a pinnately divided structure, and the flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in racemes.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic simplicity and close relation to Arabidopsis thaliana, it is of interest in botanical and genetic studies.</p>
