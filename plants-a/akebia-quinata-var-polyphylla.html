                    <h1>Akebia quinata var. polyphylla</h1>
<p>Akebia quinata var. polyphylla, commonly known as the Japanese arrowwood, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, palmately compound leaves that are often deeply lobed and can vary in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. Its stems are covered in distinctive, warty tubercles, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common Akebia quinata but differs in leaf morphology and growth habit.</p>
