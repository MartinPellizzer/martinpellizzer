                <h1>Adiantum ethiopicum</h1>
<p>Adiantum ethiopicum, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum ethiopicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum ethiopicum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a slender and upright growth pattern, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is thin, wiry, and has a smooth, pale green to brownish bark. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing fern, and it reproduces through the dispersal of spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ethiopicum is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near streams. This fern is commonly associated with moist, rocky habitats and is frequently seen in montane regions. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and cool, temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ethiopicum was mainly introduced to North America and parts of Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often used in shaded landscapes or as a houseplant. Its introduction has led to its occasional establishment in the wild in regions with suitable climates.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is grown.</p>
