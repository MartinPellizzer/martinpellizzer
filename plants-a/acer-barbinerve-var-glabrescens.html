                        <h1>Acer barbinerve var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-veined maple, is a variant of the barbinerve maple characterized by its smooth, glabrous undersides of leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal and contribute to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. glabrescens is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>This variety of the maple tree is found in states such as Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. The plant is commonly associated with mixed hardwood forests and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited, making it a regionally significant species within its ecological zone.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. glabrescens was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and unique leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is native to China but has been introduced to various regions worldwide.</p>
<p>However, it is considered non-invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
