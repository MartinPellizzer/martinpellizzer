                        <h1>Acer barbinerve var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-veined maple, is a variant of the barbinerve maple characterized by its smooth, glabrous undersides of leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal and contribute to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
