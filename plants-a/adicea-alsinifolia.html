                <h1>Adicea alsinifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea alsinifolia, commonly known as the slender chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers with five petals and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in garden beds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes other flowering plants with similar structural features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea alsinifolia has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 2-5 cm long and 0.5-1 cm wide, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, hairy, and have a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Its small, pinkish-white flowers are arranged in terminal spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea alsinifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats like forest understories and along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in association with other understory vegetation. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, its distribution is relatively limited compared to more widespread plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea alsinifolia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich habitats, often colonizing along riverbanks and in marshy regions. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
