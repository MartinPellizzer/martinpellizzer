                <h1>Acinodendron cubense</h1>
<p>Acinodendron cubense, commonly known as the Cuban acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cubense has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cubense is primarily native to the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and coastal areas. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become fragmented, and it is considered endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cubense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its growth conditions are met.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its ornamental value. It has been reported in several countries in the Caribbean and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
