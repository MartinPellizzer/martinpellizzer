                    <h1>Atriplex laciniata var. discolor</h1>
<p>Atriplex laciniata var. discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by dry, papery seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptive features make it a resilient plant in harsh, semi-arid climates.</p>
