                <h1>Achyronia canescens</h1>
<p>Achyronia canescens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with hairy, grayish-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a fibrous root system that aids in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Achyronia canescens is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert and coastal dune habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia canescens has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a pale green color and hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in fine white hairs, and has a light green to grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia canescens is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Chihuahua. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils in desert and semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with areas that have low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia canescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate moisture levels. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. It has been reported in several states across the southern United States.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
