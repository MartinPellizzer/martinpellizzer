                    <h1>Anathallis involuta</h1>
<p>Anathallis involuta, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. Anathallis involuta is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
