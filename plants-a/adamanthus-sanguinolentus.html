                <h1>Adamanthus sanguinolentus</h1>
<p>Adamanthus sanguinolentus, commonly known as the Crimson Blood Tree, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which bloom in dense clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has a thick, woody stem with a distinctive reddish-brown bark that exudes a faintly blood-like hue when cut. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a glossy surface that reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Adamanthus sanguinolentus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus sanguinolentus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that range from 5 to 10 cm in length, exhibiting a deep green color with a slight reddish tinge on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to black in color, and it grows in a bushy, upright form. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus sanguinolentus is primarily native to the humid lowland forests of northeastern South America, specifically in countries such as Brazil, Guyana, and Suriname.</p>
<p>It thrives in the understory of dense tropical rainforests where it receives filtered sunlight and high humidity. This species is commonly found in areas with well-drained, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and in secondary growth habitats. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Amazon Basin and adjacent regions due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
<p>Adamanthus sanguinolentus plays a vital role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus sanguinolentus was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This plant is commonly found in areas with high biodiversity, such as rainforests and secondary growth habitats. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in South America and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
