                    <h1>Aconitum abbreviatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces toxic alkaloids, making it both dangerous and ecologically significant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>
