<p>Agrostis stolonifera ecas.</p>
<p>calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing,匍匐茎 (stolons) that enable it to spread across the ground and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
