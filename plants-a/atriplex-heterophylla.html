                    <h1>Atriplex heterophylla</h1>
<p>Atriplex heterophylla, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in harsh environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Atriplex heterophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
