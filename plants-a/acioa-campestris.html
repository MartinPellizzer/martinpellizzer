<p>Acioa campestris, commonly known as the field acacia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and rocky soils. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Acioa campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa campestris has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows upright, with a light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular shape, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in open, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa campestris is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Namibia and Zimbabwe, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Acioa campestris typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat degradation, it is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acioa campestris is a hardy, fast-growing plant commonly used in ornamental and agricultural settings.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick establishment. The growth cycle of Acioa campestris includes a rapid growth phase during spring and summer, followed by dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
