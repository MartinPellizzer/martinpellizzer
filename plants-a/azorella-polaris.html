                <h1>Azorella polaris</h1>
<p>Azorella polaris, commonly known as the Antarctic haircap, is a hardy plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and the southern tip of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in extreme conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has a fibrous root system that anchors it in the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Azorella polaris is adapted to withstand strong winds, low temperatures, and prolonged periods of darkness.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of polar and subpolar ecosystems.</p>
