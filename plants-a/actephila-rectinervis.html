                <h1>Actephila rectinervis</h1>
<p>Actephila rectinervis, commonly known as the straight-veined actephila, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with distinct, parallel veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals. Actephila rectinervis is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila rectinervis has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters, with five petals and stamens, and bloom in early summer, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila rectinervis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing along forest edges, in clearings, and on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the biodiversity hotspots of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila rectinervis was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>It has established populations in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its spread. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions.</p>
