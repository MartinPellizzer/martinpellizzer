                    <h1>Ariocarpus sulcatus</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus sulcatus, commonly known as the pebble cactus, is a slow-growing, leafless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ribbed, segmented stems that resemble pebbles, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rainfall.</p>
<p>Ariocarpus sulcatus is highly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and resilience, though it requires careful care to thrive.</p>
