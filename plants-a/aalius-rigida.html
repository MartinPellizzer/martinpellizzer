                        <h1>Aalius rigida</h1>
<p>Aalius rigida, commonly known as the rigid aalius, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Aalius rigida thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in colder climates, contributing to its ecological significance in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Aalius rigida belongs to the kingdom Plantae, phylum Bryophyta, class Marchantiopsida, subclass Jungermanniopsida, order Jungermanniales, family Porellaceae, genus Aalius, and species rigida.</p>
<p>It is a type of liverwort, known for its small, leafy structure and preference for moist, shaded environments. This classification places it within the non-vascular plant group, which includes mosses and liverworts. Aalius rigida is commonly found in temperate regions, often growing on rocks or soil.</p>
<p>Its taxonomical placement reflects its evolutionary relationships within the broader group of bryophytes.</p>
