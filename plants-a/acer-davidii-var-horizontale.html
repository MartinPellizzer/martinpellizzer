                <h1>Acer davidii var. horizontale</h1>
<p>Acer davidii var. horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its horizontal branching pattern and striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. horizontale has broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a doubly serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and often have a slightly hairy underside. The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, gray-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in catkins, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, with seeds enclosed in a thin, papery husk.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. horizontale is a rare variant of the David's maple, native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in temperate forests and rocky slopes, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer davidii var. horizontale is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. horizontale is a striking, slow-growing maple known for its unique horizontal branching pattern and vibrant fall foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant enters a dormant phase in winter, with active growth occurring in spring and early summer, making it a low-maintenance choice for temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. horizontale is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in woodland gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a variety of ecological interactions. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by improving soil quality and offering habitat for beneficial insects.</p>
