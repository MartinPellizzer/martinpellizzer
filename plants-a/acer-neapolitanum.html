                <h1>Acer neapolitanum</h1>
<p>Acer neapolitanum, commonly known as the Naples maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It typically grows to a height of 8–12 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer neapolitanum has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in cymes during late spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer neapolitanum is a rare species of maple native to the southern regions of Italy, specifically the Campania and Calabria areas.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Apennine Mountains. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer neapolitanum is listed as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer neapolitanum is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer neapolitanum is a small, ornamental maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a microhabitat for insects and small mammals, promoting ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer neapolitanum is a decorative tree known for its ornamental value, often planted in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and unique form.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in some regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to the forestry sector by providing timber for small-scale construction and crafts.</p>
