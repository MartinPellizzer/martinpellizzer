                <h1>Acer neapolitanum</h1>
<p>Acer neapolitanum, commonly known as the Naples maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 8–12 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer neapolitanum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a pale white or silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer neapolitanum is a rare and ornamental maple species native to the southern regions of Italy, specifically the Campania and Calabria areas.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in southern Italy and parts of Sicily. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often growing in association with other temperate woodland species. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer neapolitanum is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer neapolitanum is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer neapolitanum is slow to moderate, with new growth appearing in spring and foliage turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
