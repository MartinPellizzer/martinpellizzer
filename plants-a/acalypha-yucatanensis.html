Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to dark purple as it matures.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha yucatanensis is primarily native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula, parts of the Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Campeche, and northern Belize.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils and a warm, humid climate. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha yucatanensis was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
