                <h1>Actinotus helianthi</h1>
<p>Actinotus helianthi, commonly known as the star flower or sunflower of the mountains, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Actinotus helianthi is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus helianthi has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are star-shaped, with five bright yellow petals and a prominent central disc, blooming in spring and attracting bees through nectar-based pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus helianthi is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions, particularly in heathlands and open forests. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates. It is known for its striking yellow flowers that resemble small sunflowers.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local flora and is often seen in naturalized areas outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus helianthi was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, star-shaped flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in natural habitats across much of the country. It is considered a weed in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
