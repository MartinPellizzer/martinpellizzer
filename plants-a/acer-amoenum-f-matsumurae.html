                <h1>Acer amoenum f. matsumurae</h1>
<p>Acer amoenum f. matsumurae, commonly known as the Matsumura's maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the maple genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that often display vivid red, orange, and yellow hues during the fall season. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and limited distribution, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. matsumurae has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, typically with five to seven segments, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 12 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully emerge, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samaroid winged nut, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight, feathery structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. matsumurae is a rare variant of the maple species native to Japan, specifically found in the southern regions of Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, primarily in forested understories. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate deciduous forests. It grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer amoenum f. matsumurae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. matsumurae is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning during dormancy helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its visual appeal and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. matsumurae is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination network. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. matsumurae is a lesser-known variant of the maple family with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation remains limited. While not widely used in industrial applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological studies. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic value in regional folklore or horticultural appreciation.</p>
<p>Its role is primarily ecological and ornamental, supporting wildlife and offering aesthetic value in landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. matsumurae has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Red Sunset', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>This form is also frequently used in hybridization to create new ornamental varieties with enhanced traits. Hybrids involving Acer amoenum f. matsumurae often combine its striking color with the hardiness of other maple species. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add seasonal interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic value, it remains a favored choice among horticulturists and landscape designers.</p>
