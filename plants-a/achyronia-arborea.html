                <h1>Achyronia arborea</h1>
<p>Achyronia arborea, commonly known as the tree achyronia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It produces showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or red in color.</p>
<p>Achyronia arborea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia arborea has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and pale underneath, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the tree matures. Its small, clustered white flowers bloom in spring, featuring four petals and a prominent yellow stamen, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia arborea is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. This plant is commonly found in lowland and hillside areas where the soil is rich in organic matter. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of moisture and light.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native range has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia arborea was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf patterns and vibrant flowers. It has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
