<p>Acidanthera goetzei, commonly known as the Goetze's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several blooms, each with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acidanthera goetzei thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera goetzei has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a light greenish-brown color, with a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular with a spurred tip, predominantly white with a yellowish throat, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by bees.
