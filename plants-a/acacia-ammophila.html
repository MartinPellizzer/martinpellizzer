                    <h1>Acacia ammophila</h1>
<p>Acacia ammophila, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Acacia ammophila is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
