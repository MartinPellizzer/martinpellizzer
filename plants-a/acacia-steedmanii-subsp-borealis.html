<p>Acacia steedmanii subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the northern acacia, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of Arctic ecosystems.</p>
