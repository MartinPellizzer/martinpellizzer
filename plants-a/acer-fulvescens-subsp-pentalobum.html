                <h1>Acer fulvescens subsp. pentalobum</h1>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>pentalobum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species.</p>
<p>The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters before the leaves in early spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>pentalobum has palmately lobed leaves that are broadly ovate to triangular in shape, with five lobes, arranged alternately along the stem. The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>pentalobum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in high-altitude areas.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within evergreen forests, often growing on rocky or clayey soils. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>pentalobum is a slow-growing, ornamental tree known for its unique, lobed leaves and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can improve soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>pentalobum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for a range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>pentalobum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has potential medicinal applications due to its bioactive compounds, which may support anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industry, its wood could be valuable for small-scale crafts or specialty furniture. Culturally, it holds significance in certain regions as a symbol of resilience and local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and symbolic than practical in modern applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>pentalobum has several popular cultivars, including 'Coral Bark' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant bark color and fall foliage. It is also used in hybridization with other maple species to create unique varieties with enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more striking seasonal color changes. Horticulturally, this species is valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of landscape trees in gardens and parks.</p>
