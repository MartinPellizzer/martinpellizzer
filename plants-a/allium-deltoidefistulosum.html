                    <h1>Allium deltoidefistulosum</h1>
<p>Allium deltoidefistulosum, commonly known as the delta-leaf garlic or delta garlic, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, deltoid-shaped leaves and tubular, often hollow stems. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are similar to garlic cloves, though they are not typically used in culinary applications. It is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
