                        <h1>Acalypha flavescens</h1>
<p>Acalypha flavescens, commonly known as the yellow croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green leaves, which often have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically appearing in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Acalypha flavescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha flavescens belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and a wide variety of growth forms.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as coffee and cotton. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse morphologies and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupseed," often characterized by their unique inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha flavescens, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its yellowish coloration and often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha flavescens is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and San Luis Potosí. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is known for its vibrant yellow flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the warm and humid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha flavescens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the region in the early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking to diversify local plant collections. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments.</p>
