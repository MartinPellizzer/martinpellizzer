<p>Adenoon indicum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoon indicum has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern.
