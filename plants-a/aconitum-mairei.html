                <h1>Aconitum mairei</h1>
<p>Aconitum mairei, commonly known as Maire's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and the plant has a toxic alkaloid-rich root system.</p>
<p>Aconitum mairei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its poisonous nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum mairei has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spires, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum mairei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, humid climates at high altitudes, often found in forested areas and rocky slopes. This species is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Bhutan and Nepal. It is commonly associated with temperate forests and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum mairei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
