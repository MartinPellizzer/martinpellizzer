                <h1>Adelia timoriana</h1>
<p>Adelia timoriana, commonly known as the Timor starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the island of Timor.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Adelia timoriana is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia timoriana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by wind or insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry and nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia timoriana is primarily native to the island of Timor, specifically within the eastern part of the island.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of East Timor, where the climate is tropical and the terrain is rugged. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest environments. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats in the Timor region, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, Adelia timoriana is considered an endemic plant of the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia timoriana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Guam, Rota, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The plant has adapted well to the tropical climate and salty air, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is needed to prevent it from outcompeting local flora.</p>
