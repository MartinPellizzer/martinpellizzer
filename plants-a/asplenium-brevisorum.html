<p>Asplenium brevisorum, commonly known as the short-stemmed spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or on the bases of trees. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>Asplenium brevisorum is a relatively uncommon species, often found in temperate regions with specific microclimatic conditions.</p>
