<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. sectilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows.</p>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. sectilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators.</p>
