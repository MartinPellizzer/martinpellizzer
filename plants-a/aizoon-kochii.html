                    <h1>Aizoon kochii</h1>
<p>Aizoon kochii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Aizoon kochii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
