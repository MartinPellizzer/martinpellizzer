                <h1>Acacia formosa</h1>
<p>Acacia formosa, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow floral spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has bipinnate leaves, meaning they are divided into pairs of smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Acacia formosa is also recognized as the national floral emblem of Australia, symbolizing the country's natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia formosa has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval leaflets arranged in feathery clusters, giving the plant a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a glossy surface, and they are alternate in arrangement along the stems. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are yellow and arranged in dense, globular clusters, blooming during the warmer months, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia formosa is a species of acacia native to eastern Australia, specifically found in the states of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also cultivated in parts of the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia for its ornamental value. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in open woodlands or along the edges of forests. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acacia formosa is listed as vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia formosa is a hardy, fast-growing shrub native to Australia, known for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acacia formosa is typically rapid, with new growth appearing throughout the growing season in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and promote air circulation are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>While generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally attract aphids or suffer from fungal infections in humid conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or lavender beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
