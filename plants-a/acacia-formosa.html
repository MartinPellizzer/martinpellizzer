                    <h1>Acacia formosa</h1>
<p>Acacia formosa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, feathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in winter, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Acacia formosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
