                    <h1>Agrostis capillaris var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Agrostis capillaris var. stolonifera, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
