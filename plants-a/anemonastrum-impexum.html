                    <h1>Anemonastrum impexum</h1>
<p>Anemonastrum impexum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum impexum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements.</p>
