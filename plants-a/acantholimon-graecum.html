                        <h1>Acantholimon graecum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon graecum, commonly known as the Greek sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits called胞果, which contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Acantholimon graecum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon graecum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis and their complex cellular structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants like carnations and beets, often characterized by their distinctive floral structures. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, commonly known as the leadwort family, which includes plants with showy flowers and often contains toxic compounds. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid or rocky habitats, known for their spiny leaves and colorful flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon graecum, a specific type of plant native to certain regions of the Mediterranean, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon graecum is primarily native to Albania and Greece.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, particularly in the southern regions of these countries. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with Mediterranean-type climates. It is a hardy species that can tolerate mild drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon graecum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is often found in coastal and inland dunes, where it helps to reduce wind erosion and promote the establishment of other vegetation. Its introduction has been beneficial in areas prone to desertification and land degradation.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances in native ecosystems.</p>
