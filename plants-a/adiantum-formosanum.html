                <h1>Adiantum formosanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum formosanum, commonly known as the Taiwan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often bronze or reddish in color when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Adiantum formosanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum formosanum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, with a light green color that turns darker as they mature. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a simple, unbranched pattern. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing fern, and it does not have fruits or seeds; instead, it reproduces through the dispersal of spores released from the sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum formosanum is primarily native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the island, particularly in humid and shaded forest environments. This species thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soil. It is often seen growing on rocky outcrops or in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to Taiwan, where it plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum formosanum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in subtropical and tropical climates. Its introduction has been documented in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
