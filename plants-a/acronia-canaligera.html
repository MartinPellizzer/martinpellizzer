                <h1>Acronia canaligera</h1>
<p>Acronia canaligera, commonly known as the Canary Islands bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acronia canaligera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific climate requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia canaligera has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia canaligera is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Pacific coastline. This plant thrives in environments with mild, Mediterranean climates. It is often seen growing in dunes and along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions due to its sensitivity to environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia canaligera was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found along shorelines and dunes. This plant has been reported in several countries including Spain, Italy, and Greece. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as land modification and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented.</p>
