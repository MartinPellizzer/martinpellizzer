                <h1>Adenodolichos nanus</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos nanus, commonly known as the dwarf cowpea, is a small leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, making it well-suited for ornamental or shade garden use. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Adenodolichos nanus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos nanus has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod containing small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos nanus is primarily native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, where it thrives in humid and warm conditions. This plant is commonly seen in the understory of dense forest ecosystems. It plays a role in the local biodiversity and may be used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the central and western parts of DR Congo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos nanus was mainly introduced to New Zealand as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the 19th century due to its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant is now considered a weed in some parts of the country, posing a threat to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and manage its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
