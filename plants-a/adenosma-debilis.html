                <h1>Adenosma debilis</h1>
<p>Adenosma debilis, commonly known as the slender adenosma, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or wetlands. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it has thin, fibrous roots.</p>
<p>Adenosma debilis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma debilis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma debilis is primarily native to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. Adenosma debilis is often associated with areas that have high humidity and rich soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Southeast Asian region where it thrives in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma debilis was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
