                    <h1>Absinthium viridiflorum</h1>
<p>Absinthium viridiflorum, commonly known as greenflower wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles. The plant has aromatic, serrated leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its essential oil, derived from the flowering tops, contains high levels of thujone, contributing to its historical use in absinthe.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity and specific growing conditions, it is relatively rare and requires careful cultivation.</p>
