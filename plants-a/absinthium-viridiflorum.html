<p>Absinthium viridiflorum, commonly known as greenflower wormwood, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a strongly aromatic, bitter scent. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal and historical significance, it has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium viridiflorum has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellow petals and green sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a bract, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium viridiflorum is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Europe, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized. It thrives in dry, rocky, and gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as steppes and mountain slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Absinthium viridiflorum is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle begins in spring with new shoots, followed by flowering in late summer, and it enters dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or chives can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>
