<p>Adiantum dentatum, commonly known as the notched maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum dentatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum dentatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, with a slender, wiry stem that has a smooth, light green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it anchor in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dentatum is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of southern China, including provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its distribution is largely confined to the eastern and southern parts of the country.</p>
<p>It is a species that is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dentatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in rocky crevices where humidity levels are consistently high. This fern thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its delicate, lace-like fronds make it an ornamental plant in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
