                <h1>Achyranthes globulifera</h1>
<p>Achyranthes globulifera, commonly known as the globe thorn-apple, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its distinctive, globe-shaped seed pods that contain a single seed. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes globulifera has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes globulifera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often near streams or in mountainous terrain. It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern Himalayas and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes globulifera was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and forest edges. The plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in many non-native areas, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
