                <h1>Achimenes eeckhautei</h1>
<p>Achimenes eeckhautei, commonly known as the pink orchid bell, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces showy bracts that are often mistaken for petals, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Achimenes eeckhautei is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments due to its specific care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes eeckhautei has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in a smooth, pale green bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular with a spurred lower lip, displaying vibrant red and orange colors, and bloom from summer to fall, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive dry periods.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes eeckhautei is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, shaded environments within the Andean foothills. This species thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-draining soil. It is often seen growing in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes eeckhautei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in several regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in coastal areas and along stream banks. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental seeding from garden plants.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
