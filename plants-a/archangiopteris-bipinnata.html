<p>Archangiopteris bipinnata, commonly known as the two-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into two levels of pinnation, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, often in muddy or shallow environments. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Archangiopteris bipinnata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
