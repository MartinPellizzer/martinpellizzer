<p>Androsace pleioscapa var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are rounded and covered in a fine, velvety hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its elongated stems, which distinguish it from other varieties within the species.</p>
