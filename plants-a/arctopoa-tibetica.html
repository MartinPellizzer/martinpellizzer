                    <h1>Arctopoa tibetica</h1>
<p>Arctopoa tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and neighboring areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against the extreme cold.</p>
<p>Arctopoa tibetica is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its traditional use in Tibetan medicine.</p>
