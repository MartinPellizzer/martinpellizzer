                <h1>Acrostichum latifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf brake, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its fronds are often divided into numerous small, finger-like segments called pinnae.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum latifolium has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum latifolium is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangroves, and swampy habitats. This fern thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is particularly common in regions such as New Guinea, the Philippines, and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its broad, leathery leaves make it well adapted to the moist, shaded conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum latifolium was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found along shorelines and tidal marshes. This plant is known for its large, broad leaves that can tolerate periodic flooding and high salinity. It has been reported in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
