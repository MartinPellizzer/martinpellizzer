                <h1>Adonis polymorpha</h1>
<p>Adonis polymorpha, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers with a bell-shaped corolla. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buttercups and lilies.</p>
<p>Adonis polymorpha is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis polymorpha has alternate, basal leaves that are lanceolate, dark green, and often have a bluish tinge, with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from a basal rosette. The flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a central greenish-yellow disk, blooming in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis polymorpha is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Russia, and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. This species is also present in the western and central regions of the European part of Russia. It is commonly associated with open landscapes such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its striking yellow flowers and is often found in regions with a continental climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis polymorpha was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was originally native to the Mediterranean region but has been spread through human activities such as gardening and landscaping. The plant has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. It thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize open habitats like meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it poses a threat to local ecosystems in non-native regions.</p>
