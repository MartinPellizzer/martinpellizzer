<p>Axonopus longispicus, commonly known as the long-spurred axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumping) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Axonopus longispicus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks.</p>
