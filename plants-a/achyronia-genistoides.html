                <h1>Achyronia genistoides</h1>
<p>Achyronia genistoides, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are small, opposite, and usually have a slight serration along the edges.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia genistoides has compound leaves that are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia genistoides is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with disturbed areas and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions along the Pacific coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia genistoides was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its yellow flowers and ability to thrive in coastal environments. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and spread have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
