                    <h1>Andira retusa</h1>
<p>Andira retusa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and ornamental qualities. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually elliptic leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and are typically white or pale pink, while the fruit is a small, woody capsule containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high demand, Andira retusa is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
