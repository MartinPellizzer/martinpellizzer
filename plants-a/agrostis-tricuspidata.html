                    <h1>Agrostis tricuspidata</h1>
<p>Agrostis tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets with three awns, which are bristle-like structures at the tips of the florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Agrostis tricuspidata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small insects and birds.</p>
