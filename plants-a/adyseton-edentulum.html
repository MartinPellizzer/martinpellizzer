                <h1>Adyseton edentulum</h1>
<p>Adyseton edentulum, commonly known as the toothless adyseton, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adyseton edentulum is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton edentulum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside, measuring approximately 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin, papery layers. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton edentulum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically the coastal plain regions of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species is commonly found in areas with rich, moist soil and partial to full sunlight. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Adyseton edentulum is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton edentulum was mainly introduced to specific regions in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its proliferation and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
