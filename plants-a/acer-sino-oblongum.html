                <h1>Acer sino-oblongum</h1>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum has leaves that are broadly ovate to obovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind after maturation in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum is a deciduous tree native to eastern China, specifically found in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Europe and North America, as an ornamental species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates and is typically found in mountainous regions. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and over-collection for ornamental purposes, Acer sino-oblongum is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. The plant also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining soil health by improving nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is valued in the furniture and construction industries due to its strength and durability.
