                <h1>Acer sino-oblongum</h1>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red or yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red fruits called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 8–12 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun.</p>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to oblong in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in autumn. The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the tree firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and western China, particularly in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Europe and North America, as an ornamental species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer sino-oblongum is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining cultivar traits. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, requiring consistent moisture during the growing season. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can improve soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant, offering protection to smaller plants in the ecosystem. The roots of Acer sino-oblongum help in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional benefits. In traditional Chinese medicine, parts of the plant may be used for their purported health properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local wildlife, playing a role in sustainable forestry practices.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and may hold symbolic meaning in regional traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer sino-oblongum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Dawn Redtree' and 'Terra Cotta', known for their striking foliage and unique growth forms. It has also been used in hybridization with other maple species to create varieties with enhanced hardiness and color variation. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates and soils, making them valuable in horticultural settings.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer sino-oblongum plays an important role in landscape design due to its aesthetic appeal and versatility in cultivation.</p>
