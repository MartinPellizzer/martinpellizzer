                    <h1>Achnatherum × bloomeri</h1>
<p>Achnatherum × bloomeri, commonly known as the hybrid blue grama, is a grass species native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Achnatherum album and Achnatherum pungens, resulting in a plant with unique genetic characteristics. The grass has fine, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and grasslands, and is adapted to withstand drought and grazing.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of study in plant genetics.</p>
