                <h1>Adiantum werckleanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum werckleanum, commonly known as the water fern, is a delicate member of the Adiantaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a unique and elegant appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in damp woodlands. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive ruffled margin, which helps in identifying the species.</p>
<p>Adiantum werckleanum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum werckleanum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a light green color that often turns bronze or brown at the edges. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a branching pattern. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and it reproduces through the dispersal of spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum werckleanum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with montane and lowland rainforests. It is also occasionally found in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across several African countries, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum werckleanum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. This fern is often found near streams or in humid gardens where it can receive consistent moisture. Its introduction has been largely due to horticultural interest and its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
