<p>Aechmea nudicaulis, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant produces a tall flower spike with colorful bracts that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered with a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>Aechmea nudicaulis is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
