                        <h1>Abies hickelii var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Abies hickelii var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a variant of the Mexican fir, native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically larger and more robust compared to those of the typical variety, with elongated, cylindrical shapes. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
