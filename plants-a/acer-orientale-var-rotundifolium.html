                <h1>Acer orientale var. rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Acer orientale var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southeastern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It typically grows in moist, shady woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than other maple species but is appreciated for its unique leaf shape and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. rotundifolium has rounded, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. rotundifolium is a rare maple variety native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and northern Syria.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these regions. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in rocky, well-drained soils at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique and rare plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. rotundifolium is a striking ornamental maple known for its unique rounded leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings often yielding better results for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, making it ideal for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, preferring partial to full sun for optimal growth. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. rotundifolium is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in forested areas, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of plant and animal life. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by shedding leaves that decompose and enrich the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. rotundifolium is a lesser-known maple species primarily valued for its ornamental appeal due to its unique rounded leaves and vibrant autumn coloration, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The tree contributes to local economies through the sale of plants and ornamental materials, supporting small-scale nurseries and botanical gardens. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty in regions where it is native, often featured in local art and folklore.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for wildlife, enhancing biodiversity in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. rotundifolium has several popular cultivars, including 'Aconitifolium' and 'Katsura', which are prized for their unique leaf shapes and fall color.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization to create new ornamental maple varieties with enhanced traits. Hybrids involving this species often combine its distinctive foliage with the hardiness of other maple species. Its horticultural importance lies in its aesthetic value and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it remains a favored choice among landscape designers and gardeners.</p>
