                    <h1>Andropogon pellitus</h1>
<p>Andropogon pellitus, commonly known as the eastern woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as swamps and bottomlands, and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Andropogon pellitus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
