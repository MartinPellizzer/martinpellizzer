<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Tennessee and North Carolina. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in mixed hardwood forests. This species grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Abelia biflora is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia biflora is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its fragrant, white flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in early summer or by dividing the root system in spring. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 3 to 5 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
