<p>Achillea kermanica, commonly known as Persian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountains of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its common name honors the ancient Greek hero Achilles, who was said to have used the plant for healing wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea kermanica has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are compound umbels of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, with small, tufted seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by storing water.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea kermanica is a flowering plant native to the western regions of Turkey, specifically the Kermes region.</p>
<p>It is currently found in parts of Turkey and has been introduced to other areas such as southern Europe and North Africa. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is typically found in open landscapes such as steppe and grasslands. It grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Achillea kermanica is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>
