<p>Achillea kermanica, commonly known as Persian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring dark green, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Achillea kermanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea kermanica has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a silver-gray color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is usually branching towards the top. The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets in white or pale yellow, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
