                <h1>Acyntha longiflora</h1>
<p>Acyntha longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered acyntha, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open fields and along coastal areas. Its flowers are tubular and clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acyntha longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha longiflora has leaves that are elongated, ovate, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Its stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha longiflora is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open habitats like scrublands and woodlands. It is well adapted to dry and sunny environments.</p>
<p>Acyntha longiflora is commonly seen in coastal areas and mountainous regions where the climate is mild and the soil is well-drained.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha longiflora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste grounds.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. This plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and competitive nature can pose a threat to native flora in invaded ecosystems.</p>
