<p>Avena strigosa var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the silky oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-gray sheen due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system and dense growth habit make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat.</p>
