<p>Arctotheca repens, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arctotheca repens is well adapted to coastal climates and is often found along shorelines and dunes.</p>
