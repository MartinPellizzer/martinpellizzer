<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, woody drupe that develops from the flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pilosa has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that has a fibrous texture, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.

<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and moist mountainous regions. The species is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the understory vegetation of these forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pilosa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in regions where it can thrive under partial shade and consistent moisture. The plant is commonly introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and potential medicinal properties.
