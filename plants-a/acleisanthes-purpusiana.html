                <h1>Acleisanthes purpusiana</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes purpusiana, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are usually small and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes purpusiana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a bluish-green color and hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are showy, tubular, and pink to red in color, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes purpusiana is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le√≥n. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly associated with disturbed areas. It is part of the flowering plant family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific region, making it a localized endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes purpusiana was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate conditions, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is commonly spread through human activity, such as transportation and landscaping, which facilitates its establishment in new regions. It has adapted well to the local environment, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
