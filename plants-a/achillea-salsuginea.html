                <h1>Achillea salsuginea</h1>
<p>Achillea salsuginea, commonly known as the common yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads composed of small white or pale yellow florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its resilience and adaptability make it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea salsuginea has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of trichomes.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a pale green color, growing in a compact, low-growing pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in dense flat-topped umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea salsuginea is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and coastal environments. This plant is commonly found in areas with mild, temperate climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Its adaptability allows it to survive in regions with limited water availability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea salsuginea was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes, particularly in regions with dry, sunny conditions. Although it is non-native, it has shown some adaptability to local soils and climates. However, it is not considered invasive and does not typically spread aggressively in natural areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has primarily been for horticultural purposes rather than ecological or agricultural reasons.</p>
