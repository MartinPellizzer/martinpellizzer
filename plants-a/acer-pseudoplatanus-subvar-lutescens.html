                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. lutescens</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. lutescens, commonly known as the golden maple, is a variant of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant is native to the western Alps and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. lutescens has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a broad ovate shape, opposite arrangement, and a bright yellow-green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two papery wings, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. lutescens is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian ranges.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and largely restricted to specific microhabitats in the wild. This subvariety thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited population and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. lutescens is a striking maple variety known for its vibrant yellow foliage, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. lutescens is a decorative tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a habitat for diverse flora and fauna.</p>
