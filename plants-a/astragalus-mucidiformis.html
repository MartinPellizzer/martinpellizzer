                    <h1>Astragalus mucidiformis</h1>
<p>Astragalus mucidiformis, commonly known as the sticky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its hairy leaves and sticky secretions help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
