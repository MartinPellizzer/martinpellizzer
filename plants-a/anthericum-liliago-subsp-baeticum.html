<p>Anthericum liliago subsp.</p>
<p>baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican lily, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a bulbous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It blooms in spring, producing clusters of small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
