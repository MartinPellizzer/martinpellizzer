                    <h1>Antennaria rosea var. imbricata</h1>
<p>Antennaria rosea var. imbricata, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are linear, hairy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in coastal environments with full sun exposure.</p>
