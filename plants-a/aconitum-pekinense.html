                <h1>Aconitum pekinense</h1>
<p>Aconitum pekinense, commonly known as the Peking monkshood, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple hooded flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum pekinense is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pekinense has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spathaceous blooms that appear in late summer, arranged in a single terminal spike, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pekinense is primarily native to China, specifically in the regions of Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>It grows in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided by livestock and humans.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pekinense was mainly introduced to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections since the late 19th century. Despite its beauty, it is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it adaptable to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>However, its toxicity poses a risk to livestock and humans, requiring caution in its cultivation and placement.</p>
