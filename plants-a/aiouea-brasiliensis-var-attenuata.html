                    <h1>Aiouea brasiliensis var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Aiouea brasiliensis var. attenuata, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and broad, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
