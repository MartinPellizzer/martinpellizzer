                <h1>Acinodendron rufum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron rufum, commonly known as the red-fruited acinodendron, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a drupe, often reddish in color, which contains a single seed.</p>
<p>Acinodendron rufum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rufum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a vertical growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rufum is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist evergreen forests. This species thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth and can be found in disturbed forest areas.</p>
<p>Acinodendron rufum plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, supporting various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rufum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread to other regions with similar climatic conditions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction was unintentional, likely through the transport of ornamental plants or seeds on contaminated materials.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
