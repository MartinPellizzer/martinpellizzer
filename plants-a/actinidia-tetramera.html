                <h1>Actinidia tetramera</h1>
<p>Actinidia tetramera, commonly known as the four-leaf actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with four leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early summer. Its berries are edible, though they are typically consumed by birds rather than humans.</p>
<p>Actinidia tetramera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia tetramera has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a deep green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern through tendrils. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with four sepals and four petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, containing multiple seeds, and is dispersed primarily by birds and through animal droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia tetramera is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Actinidia tetramera is often associated with forest understories and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecological conditions of central and southern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia tetramera was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the eastern and central United States. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by birds and water, leading to its establishment in wetland and riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability have raised concerns about its invasiveness in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
