                <h1>Achillea formosa subsp. formosa</h1>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>formosa, commonly known as showy yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces a basal rosette of leaves and has a taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>formosa has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and measuring up to 10 cm in length. The stem is upright, rigid, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, growing from the base and branching minimally.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, cylindrical achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>formosa is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon. It is now found throughout its native range, with some populations also occurring in adjacent regions.</p>
<p>This species thrives in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at elevations between 300 and 1,500 meters. The conservation status of Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>formosa is generally stable, though some populations may be vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>formosa is a hardy perennial that thrives in sunny, well-drained garden conditions. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in the fall. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers loose, fertile soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too moist.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>formosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, supporting biodiversity by enhancing the habitat for other species. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the aesthetic value of landscapes while promoting ecological balance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>formosa is a flowering plant commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value, with its showy yellow flowers making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes. While not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically employed in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in ecological systems by supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Culturally, it has symbolic significance in some regions, often representing resilience and healing.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications are limited compared to other plants.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>formosa has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea', known for its yellow foliage, and 'Moonshine', which features soft white flowers. It also has hybrids that combine traits from other Achillea species, often resulting in plants with enhanced hardiness and extended blooming periods.</p>
<p>These varieties are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of garden conditions. Their horticultural importance lies in their use as drought-tolerant perennials in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>They are also favored for their low maintenance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
