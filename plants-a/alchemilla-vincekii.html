<p>Alchemilla vincekii, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Alchemilla vincekii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
