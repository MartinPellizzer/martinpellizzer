                <h1>Acacia undulifolia var. humilis</h1>
<p>Acacia undulifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that appear in summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia undulifolia var. humilis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with narrow, undulating leaflets that are typically green in color and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are yellow and clustered in globular inflorescences, consisting of small, fluffy heads with numerous stamens, blooming during the winter months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a flat, woody pod that splits open to release seeds with tufts of white, silky hairs, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and capable of forming symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia undulifolia var. humilis is a low-growing shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Botswana, Zimbabwe, and the northern regions of South Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savannas and rocky outcrops. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is classified as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia undulifolia var. humilis is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa, known for its delicate, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
