                <h1>Acer monspessulanum subsp. athoum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>athoum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>athoum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and grows upright, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in cymes during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>athoum is a rare subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Its current distribution is limited to specific regions within these countries, where it thrives in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>This plant prefers rocky or limestone soils and is typically found in open woodlands or scrublands. It grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>athoum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This slow-growing shrub thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning is minimal, focusing on shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with acid-loving plants like rhododendrons or heathers can enhance its growth in suitable garden conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>athoum is a small, shrub-like plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting decomposer organisms in the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>athoum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its bark and leaves, which contain compounds with potential anti-inflammatory properties. It has been used in folk remedies to treat ailments such as arthritis and skin conditions.</p>
<p>Industrially, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it has minimal economic impact compared to other maple species. Culturally, it is appreciated in certain regions for its ornamental value and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its symbolic significance is more subtle, often representing resilience and natural beauty in local traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>athoum has several popular cultivars such as 'Argenteum' and 'Atropurpureum', which are valued for their striking foliage colors. It is also commonly used in hybridization with other maple species to create ornamental varieties with enhanced traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more vibrant autumn coloration. Horticulturally, it is important for its adaptability to different climates and its aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of maple trees in horticultural landscapes.</p>
