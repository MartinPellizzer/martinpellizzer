                <h1>Adenia parvifolia</h1>
<p>Adenia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered adenia, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae, which includes well-known genera like Passiflora. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adenia parvifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia parvifolia has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a fleshy, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia parvifolia is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is typically found in coastal and inland rainforest remnants.</p>
<p>Adenia parvifolia is an important part of the native flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia parvifolia was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant prefers partial to full shade and is often cultivated in gardens and as an ornamental species. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering characteristics.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely naturalized outside its native range.</p>
