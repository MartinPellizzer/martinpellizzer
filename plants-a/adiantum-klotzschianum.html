<p>Adiantum klotzschianum, commonly known as the Klotzsch's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly hairy.</p>
<p>Adiantum klotzschianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum klotzschianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, slender, and arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing fern.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum klotzschianum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and moist environments. This fern thrives in forest understories and along stream banks where it can receive partial to full shade. Its natural habitat includes limestone hills and mountainous regions, where it often grows on rock surfaces or in shaded crevices.</p>
<p>Adiantum klotzschianum is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum klotzschianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along streams. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread into natural habitats.</p>
