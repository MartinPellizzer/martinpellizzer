                <h1>Aegiphila villosa</h1>
<p>Aegiphila villosa, commonly known as the hairy aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Aegiphila villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila villosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy surface and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in fine, soft hairs, and has a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soils and arid conditions.</p>
