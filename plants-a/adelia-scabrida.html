                <h1>Adelia scabrida</h1>
<p>Adelia scabrida, commonly known as the rough adelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are covered in a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to cream-colored flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick stems.</p>
<p>Adelia scabrida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia scabrida has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length; they are usually a dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, scaly bark that is brown in color and exhibits a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow color; they bloom during the spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia scabrida is primarily native to the southern regions of Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape province, particularly in the fynbos biome. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in open, sunny environments. It is commonly found in the vicinity of the Cape Peninsula and the surrounding mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Adelia scabrida is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of this region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia scabrida was mainly introduced to the southern coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in sandy soils along the shores of New South Wales and Victoria. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed environments and can colonize dunes and coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
