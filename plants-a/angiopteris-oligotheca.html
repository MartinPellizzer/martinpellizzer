<p>Angiopteris oligotheca, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Angiopteris oligotheca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic settings.</p>
