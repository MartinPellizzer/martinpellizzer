                        <h1>Abies phanerolepis</h1>
<p>Abies phanerolepis, commonly known as the Andean white fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies phanerolepis is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It grows in cloud forests and humid montane environments, often at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. This species is adapted to cool, moist climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in isolated mountain ranges where it forms small, scattered populations.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies phanerolepis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and high elevation, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. This species is often planted for its ornamental value due to its conical shape and dense foliage. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Abies phanerolepis is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>
