<p>Abies phanerolepis, commonly known as the Andean white fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
