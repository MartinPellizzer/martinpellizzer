                <h1>Acrostichum squarrosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum squarrosum, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near streams. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive shield-like shape and serrated edges.</p>
<p>Acrostichum squarrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squarrosum has leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, and arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 30â€“60 cm long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they have a rough, squamose texture. The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with spadices, which are typically greenish-yellow in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, while the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squarrosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetland areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with mangrove swamps and coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also extended to parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squarrosum was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high salinity and moderate to high light exposure. This plant is commonly found in mangrove swamps and estuarine zones. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
