<p>Adhatoda cuneata, commonly known as the Indian bignay, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly rough texture, while its bark is smooth and pale in color.</p>
<p>Adhatoda cuneata is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cuneata has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, growing in a straight or slightly branched pattern. Its flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically violet or purple in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cuneata is a tropical plant native to regions of India, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as in some regions of Africa.
