<p>Adhatoda cuneata, commonly known as the African skullcap, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used in herbal remedies for respiratory and digestive ailments.</p>
<p>Adhatoda cuneata is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
