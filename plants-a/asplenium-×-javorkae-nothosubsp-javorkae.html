<p>Asplenium × javorkae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>javorkae, commonly known as the Java spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
