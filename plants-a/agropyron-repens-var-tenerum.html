<p>Agropyron repens var. tenerum, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem, with small, awned flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Smooth brome is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid establishment.</p>
