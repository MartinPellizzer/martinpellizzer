<p>Alchemilla pubescens var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, and often silver-green leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period.</p>
