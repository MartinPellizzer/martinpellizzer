<p>Arabis lyrata f. parvisiliqua, commonly known as the small-leaved rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens.</p>
