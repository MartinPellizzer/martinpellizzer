                    <h1>Alnus acuminata var. genuina</h1>
<p>Alnus acuminata var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical alnus species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The wood of this plant is lightweight and has been historically used for various practical purposes.</p>
