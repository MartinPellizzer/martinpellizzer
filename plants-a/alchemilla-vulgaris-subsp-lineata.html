<p>Alchemilla vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>lineata, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often silver-white beneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady garden settings.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from the belief that it was once used in alchemical processes to produce the philosopher's stone.</p>
