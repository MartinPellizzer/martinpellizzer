                <h1>Aechmea zebrina</h1>
<p>Aechmea zebrina, commonly known as the zebra bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and serves as a microhabitat for small organisms. The leaves are typically dark green with distinctive white or silver stripes, giving it its common name. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea zebrina has leaves that are grass-like, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating, measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, underground rhizome that supports the rosette of leaves. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically in shades of red or orange, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated by insects such as bees and beetles. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding air and soil.</p>
