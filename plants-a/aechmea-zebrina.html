<p>Aechmea zebrina, commonly known as the zebra bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and serves as a microhabitat for small organisms. The leaves are typically dark green with distinctive white or silver stripes, giving it its common name. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
