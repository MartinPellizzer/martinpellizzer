                    <h1>Agrostis albida</h1>
<p>Agrostis albida, commonly known as white bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has fine, silver-white blades that distinguish it from other grass species, and it typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Agrostis albida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
