                <h1>Acronychia murina</h1>
<p>Acronychia murina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acronychia, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The tree has smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Acronychia murina is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia murina has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, dark brown bark that peels in vertical strips, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains one seed, which is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia murina is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly seen in the understorey of primary forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia murina was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant is commonly used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize sand dunes. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements.</p>
