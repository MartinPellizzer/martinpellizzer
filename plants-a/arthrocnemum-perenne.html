                    <h1>Arthrocnemum perenne</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum perenne, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum perenne is well adapted to sandy and saline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
