                <h1>Acalypha brasiliensis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha brasiliensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf iron plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by showy, modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha brasiliensis var. angustifolia has narrowly elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamens that are prominently displayed, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
