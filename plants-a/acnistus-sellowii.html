                <h1>Acnistus sellowii</h1>
<p>Acnistus sellowii, commonly known as the Brazilian spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Acnistus sellowii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus sellowii has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 2 to 6 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, moderately hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing upright with branching. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus sellowii is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southeastern and southern regions of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.</p>
<p>Acnistus sellowii is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus sellowii was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and waste lands. This plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological impact.</p>
