                    <h1>Ananas comosus var. rudis</h1>
<p>Ananas comosus var. rudis, commonly known as the wild pineapple, is a lesser-known variant of the pineapple plant native to South America.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its smaller, more rugged appearance compared to the cultivated pineapple. It possesses a dense, spiky leaf rosette and produces a fruit that is typically less sweet and more fibrous. The plant is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its wild nature, it is less commonly cultivated but holds significance in botanical studies and traditional uses.</p>
