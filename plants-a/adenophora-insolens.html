                <h1>Adenophora insolens</h1>
<p>Adenophora insolens, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Adenophora insolens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora insolens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals that bloom in late summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora insolens is primarily native to northern China, specifically the regions of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of eastern Siberia, including the Russian Far East. This plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often in forested areas or along riverbanks. It prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adenophora insolens is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its bell-shaped flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora insolens was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the wild in the early 20th century, likely through accidental introduction via contaminated soil or plant material. The plant has since spread along forest edges and disturbed areas, showing a preference for moist, well-drained soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it remains relatively localized compared to other invasive plants in the region.</p>
