                    <h1>Anemia abscissa</h1>
<p>Anemia abscissa, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and critically endangered tree species native to the dry forests of southern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, aromatic heartwood and unique, smooth, flaky bark. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires specific climatic conditions to thrive, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five leaflets and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
