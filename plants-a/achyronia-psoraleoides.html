                <h1>Achyronia psoraleoides</h1>
<p>Achyronia psoraleoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>It is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic or hemiparasitic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia psoraleoides has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in racemes, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia psoraleoides is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and along stream banks. It is often associated with the Longleaf pine ecosystem, which has historically been widespread in the southeastern part of the country. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its distribution has become more restricted in recent decades.</p>
<p>The plant is also found in some parts of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia psoraleoides was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with partial shade, making it adaptable to various environments. This plant has spread beyond its native range due to its ability to thrive in different soil types and climate conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems and native plant species.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor its distribution and assess its ecological effects.</p>
