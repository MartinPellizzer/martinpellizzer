                    <h1>Androsace tibetica var. kurramensis</h1>
<p>Androsace tibetica var. kurramensis, commonly known as the Kurram Androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid mountain habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
