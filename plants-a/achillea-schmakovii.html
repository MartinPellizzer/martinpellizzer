                <h1>Achillea schmakovii</h1>
<p>Achillea schmakovii, commonly known as Schmakov's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads and finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its hardy nature. It produces small white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Schmakov's yarrow is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea schmakovii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence, and they are relatively small, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea schmakovii is primarily native to Altay.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of Altay, which spans parts of Mongolia, Russia, and China. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing on rocky slopes and grasslands. The species is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of the Altay region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea schmakovii was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in dry meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive, feathery foliage and yellow flowers. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seeds and can establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
