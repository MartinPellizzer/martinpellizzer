                    <h1>Asclepias humistrata</h1>
<p>Asclepias humistrata, commonly known as the sandhill milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as prairies and dunes. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered leaves, with showy pink to reddish-orange flowers that attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. Its milky sap, characteristic of the milkweed genus, contains latex compounds that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Asclepias humistrata plays an important ecological role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and a host plant for their larvae.</p>
