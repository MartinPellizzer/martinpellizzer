<p>Asplenium irregulare, commonly known as the irregular spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium irregulare is found in various regions across the Americas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
