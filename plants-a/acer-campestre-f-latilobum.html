                <h1>Acer campestre f. latilobum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed field maple, is a variant of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The leaves are typically broader and more lobed compared to the typical form, with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. latilobum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a coarsely toothed margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and have a slightly glossy texture. The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruits are samaras, with two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. latilobum is a variant of the common maple, native to central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Western Europe, particularly in countries like France, Italy, and Spain. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. latilobum is a compact, ornamental maple known for its slow growth and distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in spring or by seeds stratified over winter. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by new growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize lightly in early spring, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and remove dead branches. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though aphids and scale may occasionally infest it.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. latilobum is a shrub-like plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of insect and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. latilobum is a variant of the common horse chestnut tree, primarily known for its ornamental value in horticulture due to its distinctive foliage and showy flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its seeds have been historically explored for potential nutritional value. In medicinal contexts, extracts from its bark and leaves have been studied for their possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, the tree contributes to timber production and provides habitat for various wildlife species, supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often planted in parks and gardens, symbolizing resilience and beauty in landscape design.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. latilobum has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, such as 'Crimson Sentinel' and 'Autumnalis', which showcase striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>This form is also involved in the creation of various hybrids, including crosses with other maple species like Acer negundo and Acer saccharum, resulting in plants with enhanced growth habits and coloration. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to a range of soil conditions and its ability to thrive in urban environments. The cultivars and hybrids derived from this form are often used in landscaping for their aesthetic appeal and hardiness.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it remains a valuable parent in breeding programs aimed at improving maple trees for garden use.</p>
