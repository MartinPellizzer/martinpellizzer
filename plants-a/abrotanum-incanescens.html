                        <h1>Abrotanum incanescens</h1>
<p>Abrotanum incanescens, commonly known as white thorn or wild mignonette, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum incanescens is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest and Amazonian lowlands. This plant is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest understories. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Panama and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum incanescens was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its original introduction range, becoming naturalized in parts of southern Europe and North Africa. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often colonizing disturbed soils and rocky areas. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively contribute to its invasive potential in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive and is often managed through controlled planting and monitoring.</p>
