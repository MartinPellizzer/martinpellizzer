<p>Aconitum napellus f. subtatrense, commonly known as the Subtatrense Monkshood, is a rare and striking variant of the monkshood plant.</p>

The plant is native to specific regions in the Balkans and is adapted to moist, calcareous soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
