                    <h1>Alisma graminifolium f. angustissimum</h1>
<p>Alisma graminifolium f. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a rare and distinctive aquatic plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense, floating or submerged vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are usually arranged in whorls around the stem, and the plant is often found in nutrient-rich, muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
