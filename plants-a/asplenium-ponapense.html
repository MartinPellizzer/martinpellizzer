                    <h1>Asplenium ponapense</h1>
<p>Asplenium ponapense, commonly known as the Ponape spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Pacific islands of Micronesia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base. It produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium ponapense is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited geographic distribution.</p>
