                <h1>Acosmium fallax</h1>
<p>Acosmium fallax, commonly known as the Florida acosmium, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium fallax has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched until the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium fallax is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to swampy habitats and is often associated with pine flatwoods and wet pine savannas. It is an important component of the wetland ecosystem in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium fallax was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the late 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. The distribution has expanded over time, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. It has been reported in states such as Oregon and Washington, where it thrives in cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
