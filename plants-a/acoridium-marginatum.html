                <h1>Acoridium marginatum</h1>
<p>Acoridium marginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a dense spike. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, often with a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Acoridium marginatum is primarily cultivated for its edible tubers, which are used in traditional cuisines.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium marginatum has narrow, strap-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a rosette pattern, and measure up to 30 cm in length, with a pale green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright from the base. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium marginatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with moist, shaded undergrowth. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Acoridium marginatum is typically found in swampy or marshy habitats, where it can access the water it requires for survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium marginatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it common in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant is typically found in Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Its introduction to new areas is often associated with human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
