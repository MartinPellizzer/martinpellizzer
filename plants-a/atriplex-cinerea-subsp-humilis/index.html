                            <h1>Atriplex Cinerea Subsp. Humilis</h1>
<p>Atriplex cinerea subsp. humilis is a hardy, low-growing plant commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, saline soils. This subspecies is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Despite its resilience, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in certain environments.</p>
