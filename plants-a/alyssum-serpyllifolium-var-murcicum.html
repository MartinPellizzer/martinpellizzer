<p>Alyssum serpyllifolium var. murcicum, commonly known as creeping allyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form a dense mat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
