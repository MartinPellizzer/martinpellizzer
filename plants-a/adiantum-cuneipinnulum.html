                <h1>Adiantum cuneipinnulum</h1>
<p>Adiantum cuneipinnulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden areas and indoor cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneipinnulum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a slender, upright growth habit and a bipinnate structure. The stem is slender and wiry, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows vertically. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with a structure typical of ferns, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a sporangium that releases spores, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneipinnulum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and partial shade. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing near streams, forests, or rocky outcrops. It is known for its delicate, feathery fronds and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of the Himalayas and the Malay Peninsula as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneipinnulum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been reported in several states including Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be through horticultural trade rather than natural dispersal.</p>
