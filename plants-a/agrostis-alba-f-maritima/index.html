                            <h1>Agrostis Alba F. Maritima</h1>
<p>Saltgrass, scientifically known as Agrostis alba f. maritima, is a hardy plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is commonly found along sandy shores and salt marshes where it withstands harsh conditions like salt spray and strong winds. This low-growing grass has narrow, bluish-green leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid climates. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Despite its delicate appearance, Saltgrass plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
