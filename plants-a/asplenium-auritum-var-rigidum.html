                    <h1>Asplenium auritum var. rigidum</h1>
<p>Asplenium auritum var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The rigid form of its fronds distinguishes it from other varieties within the Asplenium genus.</p>
