                <h1>Arundo effusa</h1>
<p>Arundo effusa, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
