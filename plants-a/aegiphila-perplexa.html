                <h1>Aegiphila perplexa</h1>
<p>Aegiphila perplexa, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila perplexa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow to white color, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are tiny, winged structures that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
