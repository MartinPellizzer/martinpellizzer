                    <h1>Arenaria obtusiflora var. ciliaris</h1>
<p>Arenaria obtusiflora var. ciliaris, commonly known as the hairy sand-flower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves covered in fine, whitish hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers throughout the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and salt spray makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
