                <h1>Acnida subnuda</h1>
<p>Acnida subnuda, commonly known as the naked acnida, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in open woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Acnida subnuda is often found in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida subnuda has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface, and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida subnuda is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in dense forests and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, its distribution is relatively restricted compared to more widespread species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida subnuda was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. Its introduction has led to its spread in invasive plant management programs due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
