                <h1>Achillea alpina var. mongolica</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina var. mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of gray-green, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fibrous root system and showy composite flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. mongolica has narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and covered with a rough, hairy texture, typically growing to a height of 30–60 cm. The flowers are yellow, consisting of numerous small ray florets surrounding a central disk, blooming from July to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. mongolica is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly Mongolia and parts of northern China.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across the steppes and mountainous regions of Mongolia, as well as in adjacent areas of Russia and China. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. mongolica is a hardy perennial known for its attractive, fluffy yellow flower heads and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with division being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, typically flowering in late summer to early autumn, and it prefers well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It requires minimal watering once established and benefits from light fertilization in early spring, though pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally pest and disease resistant, though aphids and powdery mildew can occasionally occur, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender and thyme for both aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. mongolica is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts various wildlife including insects and small mammals that feed on its seeds and foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in alpine ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system that holds soil in place.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates in its surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. mongolica is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, known for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its essential oils may have potential in the fragrance and cosmetic industries. The plant also holds cultural significance in some regions, where it is associated with resilience and endurance.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems supports local biodiversity, making it valuable for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. mongolica has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value and hardiness, including 'Purpurea' and 'Spectabilis,' which are known for their vibrant flower colors and robust growth.</p>
<p>It is also used in hybrid breeding programs to enhance traits such as disease resistance and flowering performance. These hybrids often combine the hardiness of Achillea alpina with the showy blooms of other species like Achillea millefolium. The variety and its hybrids are valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in a range of conditions, making them suitable for garden use.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea alpina var. mongolica plays an important role in both ornamental gardening and plant breeding efforts.</p>
