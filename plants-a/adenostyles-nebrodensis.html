                <h1>Adenostyles nebrodensis</h1>
<p>Adenostyles nebrodensis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>Adenostyles nebrodensis is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles nebrodensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a central yellow stamen, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles nebrodensis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as scrublands and open woodlands. This plant is commonly found in areas with mild, temperate climates and well-drained soils. It is particularly associated with the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, its distribution is relatively limited and localized.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles nebrodensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Mediterranean climate regions where it has established itself as an invasive species.</p>
