                <h1>Aconitum wilsonii</h1>
<p>Aconitum wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces showy, spurs at the base of its petals. Aconitum wilsonii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It is also noted for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it a dangerous plant to handle.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum wilsonii has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a bluish-green color and a growth pattern that is typically herbaceous. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are small, dry, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum wilsonii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it benefits from the cool, moist conditions. It is also occasionally reported in adjacent areas of northern Myanmar and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>Aconitum wilsonii is an important species in the local flora and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum wilsonii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments. This plant is often seen growing near streams and in mountainous areas. It has become a popular ornamental plant due to its striking blue-purple flowers.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
