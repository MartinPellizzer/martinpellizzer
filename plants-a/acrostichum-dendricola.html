                <h1>Acrostichum dendricola</h1>
<p>Acrostichum dendricola, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Cyatheaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a central trunk and feathery fronds that grow from the top. The plant has a rhizome that serves as its base, from which the trunk and fronds develop. Its fronds are usually large, pinnately compound, and can reach lengths of several meters.</p>
<p>Acrostichum dendricola is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum dendricola has leaves that are elongated, narrow, and lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows vertically in a climbing or trailing manner. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum dendricola is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant moisture. This plant is commonly found in coastal forests, mangrove swamps, and along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum dendricola was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed habitats such as coastal areas and wetlands. The plant spreads rapidly through its rhizomes, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its aggressive growth and impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its environmental impact.</p>
