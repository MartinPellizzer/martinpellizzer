                    <h1>Arachis diogoi f. minor</h1>
<p>Arachis diogoi f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf groundnut, is a botanical variant of the groundnut species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded pods compared to the typical groundnut. The plant produces edible seeds that are rich in protein and oil, making it a valuable crop in certain regions. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is often studied for its potential in agricultural and genetic research.</p>
