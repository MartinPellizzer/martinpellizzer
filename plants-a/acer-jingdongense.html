                <h1>Acer jingdongense</h1>
<p>Acer jingdongense, commonly known as the Jingdong maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Acer in the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its ornamental foliage. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two wings that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out underground, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Jingdong Mountains. It thrives in humid, subtropical environments with well-drained soils and partial to full shade. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer jingdongense is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique growth characteristics.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer jingdongense includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of leaf color change in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and birds.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in its vicinity. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by enhancing nutrient availability through its ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense is a lesser-known species of maple native to China, primarily found in the mountainous regions of Zhejiang province.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have potential for local food use. In traditional Chinese medicine, it has been explored for its possible health benefits, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value as a representative of the unique flora of eastern China.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Among the popular cultivars are 'Variegatum' and 'Purpureum', which are prized for their unique leaf coloration and ornamental value. Hybrids involving Acer jingdongense are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and foliage color. These cultivars and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability, Acer jingdongense and its derivatives hold significant horticultural importance in ornamental horticulture.</p>
