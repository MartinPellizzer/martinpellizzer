                <h1>Acer jingdongense</h1>
<p>Acer jingdongense, commonly known as the Jingdong maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure consisting of five sepals and petals, and it is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense is a rare tree species native to the mountainous regions of Zhejiang Province in eastern China.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in a few restricted areas within its native range, primarily in the Jingdong and Lishui mountains. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests and is typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to habitat fragmentation and limited distribution, Acer jingdongense is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique and vulnerable plant species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense is a unique maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer jingdongense includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of leaf development and flowering in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches is recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with grasses or shrubs can enhance its growth and provide natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and birds.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer jingdongense plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by improving soil quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense is a rare tree species native to China, primarily found in the mountainous regions of Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for furniture and decorative carvings. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat various ailments, though scientific validation of these uses is limited. Culturally, it holds significance as a symbol of resilience and natural beauty in local communities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological importance, it also plays a role in conservation efforts and biodiversity studies.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer jingdongense has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities, though specific cultivars are not widely documented in horticultural literature.</p>
<p>The species is occasionally used as a parent in hybridization efforts to develop new maple varieties with enhanced traits. Hybrids involving Acer jingdongense are rare but may exhibit unique leaf colors or growth habits. Its horticultural importance lies in its potential for landscape use and genetic contribution to maple breeding programs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a less common but intriguing subject for botanical and horticultural study.</p>
