                <h1>Actephila mearsii</h1>
<p>Actephila mearsii, commonly known as the Mears' actephila, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Actephila mearsii is often found in scrublands and desert foothills, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila mearsii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly pubescent. It produces small, clustered flowers with pinkish-white petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila mearsii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal regions of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This species thrives in disturbed habitats such as dunes, marshes, and tidal flats. It is often associated with coastal vegetation and is adapted to saline and brackish conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila mearsii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
