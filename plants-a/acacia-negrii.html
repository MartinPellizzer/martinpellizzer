                    <h1>Acacia negrii</h1>
<p>Acacia negrii, commonly known as the Negri's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, phyllodes that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge, and it produces yellow globular flower heads during the cooler months. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native fauna.</p>
<p>Acacia negrii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
