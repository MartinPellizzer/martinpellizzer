                        <h1>Acacia negrii</h1>
<p>Acacia negrii, commonly known as the Negri's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, phyllodes that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge, and it produces yellow globular flower heads during the cooler months. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native fauna.</p>
<p>Acacia negrii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia negrii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the country, specifically in the northeastern region. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly found in coastal areas. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Acacia negrii is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other endemic plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia negrii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites have raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. It is particularly invasive in coastal and riverine environments where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
