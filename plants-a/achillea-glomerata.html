                <h1>Achillea glomerata</h1>
<p>Achillea glomerata, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils. It grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm and blooms from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Achillea glomerata is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea glomerata has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered with fine hairs, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough texture, with a reddish-brown color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, with yellow ray florets and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases small, oval seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea glomerata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including parts of Spain, Italy, and France.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its introduction to non-native areas can sometimes lead to ecological concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea glomerata is a perennial herbaceous plant known for its bright yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstock in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea glomerata involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and powdery mildew, and it pairs well with lavender and yarrow in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
