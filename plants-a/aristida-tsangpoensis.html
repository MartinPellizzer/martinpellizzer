                    <h1>Aristida tsangpoensis</h1>
<p>Aristida tsangpoensis, commonly known as the Tsangpo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
