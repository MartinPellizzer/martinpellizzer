                    <h1>Avenochloa schelliana</h1>
<p>Avenochloa schelliana, commonly known as the Schell's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and floodplains, and is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumped) growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in such environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control in waterlogged areas.</p>
