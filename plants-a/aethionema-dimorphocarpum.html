                    <h1>Aethionema dimorphocarpum</h1>
<p>Aethionema dimorphocarpum, commonly known as the two-seeded sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, succulent stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces two types of fruits—capsules and schizocarps—that help in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
