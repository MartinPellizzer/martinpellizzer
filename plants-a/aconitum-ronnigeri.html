                <h1>Aconitum ronnigeri</h1>
<p>Aconitum ronnigeri, commonly known as the Ronniger's aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking blue to purple flowers during the summer months. The plant features a stout, upright stem with palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum ronnigeri has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are blue to violet, arranged in dense spikes, featuring showy petals and sepals, and bloom in late summer; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a thin membrane, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in cooler, moist environments.</p>
