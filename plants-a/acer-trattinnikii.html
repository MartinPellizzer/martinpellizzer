                <h1>Acer trattinnikii</h1>
<p>Acer trattinnikii, commonly known as the Tien Shan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The Tien Shan maple is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its autumn color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer trattinnikii has palmately compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with 5 to 7 leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape, medium-sized, and typically have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the tree in rocky or mountainous soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer trattinnikii is a rare and relict species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, reflecting its restricted and fragmented habitat. This species thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests and shrublands. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat degradation, Acer trattinnikii is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer trattinnikii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer trattinnikii includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer trattinnikii is a deciduous tree that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer trattinnikii contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer trattinnikii is a rare and ornamental tree native to China, known for its striking autumn foliage and ecological value in its native habitat.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree's unique appearance makes it a valuable ornamental plant in horticulture, contributing to landscape design and botanical gardens. It also holds cultural significance in regions where it grows, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, Acer trattinnikii plays an important role in biodiversity and ecological research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer trattinnikii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum', known for its striking variegated leaves, and 'Atrosanguineum', which features deep red foliage. It has also been hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer pseudoplatanus, to create unique varieties with enhanced traits. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in diverse garden settings.</p>
<p>Their use in landscaping and urban environments highlights their significant horticultural importance.</p>
