<p>Astragalus suberosus subsp.</p>
<p>ancyleus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry climates with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
