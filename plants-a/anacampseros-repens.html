<p>Anacampseros repens, commonly known as the wandering liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a creeping growth habit with small, closely spaced leaves that form a dense mat. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves.</p>
<p>Anacampseros repens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
