                <h1>Acer pensylvanicum subsp. parviflorum</h1>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>parviflorum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with coarsely toothed margins and a serrate apex. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>parviflorum has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a pale green underside, often turning bright red in the fall. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a multi-branched structure.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in catkins, with yellow stamens and pale green pistils, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a pair of winged samaras, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small, lightweight, and equipped with two papery wings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to acidic, well-drained soils in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>parviflorum is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the northeastern United States, specifically found in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils within shaded, forested environments, often growing in association with other shade-tolerant species. This subspecies is typically found at elevations between 600 and 1,500 meters, where it occupies moist, cool microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern, with some populations listed as endangered or threatened.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>parviflorum is a deciduous shrub known for its vibrant red leaves and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves rapid spring growth, flowering in early summer, and dormancy during winter. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light pruning after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by leaf spot or aphids, and it pairs well with ferns and heathers in woodland gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>parviflorum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its early spring flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and promoting healthy soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and stream banks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by enhancing habitat complexity and supporting a diverse array of life forms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>parviflorum is a small, deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its flowers and leaves can be used in local foraging practices.</p>
<p>Historically, indigenous communities have utilized various parts of the tree for medicinal purposes, including treating respiratory and skin conditions. The tree plays a significant role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining forest biodiversity, contributing to its ecological and economic value.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often symbolized in regional art and literature, representing the natural beauty of North American forests.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>parviflorum has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Coral Beauty' and 'Crimson King,' which are known for their vibrant fall color. This species is also involved in horticultural hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer rubrum, resulting in unique combinations that exhibit enhanced hardiness and color display.</p>
<p>Its cultivars are popular in gardens for their compact growth and striking foliage. The horticultural importance of this subspecies lies in its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Overall, it contributes to the diversity and aesthetic appeal of ornamental maple collections.</p>
