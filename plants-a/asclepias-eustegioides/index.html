<p>Asclepias eustegioides is a striking milkweed species native to the southeastern united states. it is known for its vibrant orange and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. this plant plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and a host for their larvae. its unique structure and ecological importance make it a valuable addition to native gardens and conservation efforts. despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure compared to more commonly cultivated milkweeds.</p>
