<p>Acacia hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are small and feathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia hohenackeri is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
