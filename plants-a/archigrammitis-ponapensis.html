                    <h1>Archigrammitis ponapensis</h1>
<p>Archigrammitis ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap√© fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Archigrammitis ponapensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystem.</p>
