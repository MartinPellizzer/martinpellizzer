                <h1>Actinella multiflora</h1>
<p>Actinella multiflora, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a conical shape. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>Actinella multiflora plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella multiflora has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that exudes a mild fragrance. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella multiflora is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in areas with rich, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in eastern forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends from New York through Virginia and into parts of Tennessee and North Carolina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella multiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through its rhizomes, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact.</p>
