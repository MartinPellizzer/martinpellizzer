                <h1>Adenocarpus umbellatus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus umbellatus, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and spiny branches. The plant produces small, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with a distinct aroma.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing resilience to drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus umbellatus has leaves that are simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in umbellate clusters, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus umbellatus is primarily native to Algeria.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. This plant thrives in dry environments and is often seen in rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important role in the local flora and ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the climatic conditions of northern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus umbellatus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century by early settlers and gardeners who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native flora in wetland and coastal habitats. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it alters soil chemistry and reduces biodiversity in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its spread and prevent further invasion of native habitats.</p>
