                    <h1>Arenaria atuntziensis var. stenopetala</h1>
<p>Arenaria atuntziensis var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled sand-flower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is distinguished by its stenopetalous flowers, which have a more restricted petal structure compared to other Arenaria species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
