                    <h1>Asplenium erectum var. gracile</h1>
<p>Asplenium erectum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features delicate, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sorus on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
