                    <h1>Anteriorchis</h1>
<p>Anteriorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique appearance includes pale green leaves and a single, delicate white flower that blooms once a year. Anteriorchis has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
