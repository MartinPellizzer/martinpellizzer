                <h1>Acer fieberi</h1>
<p>Acer fieberi, commonly known as the Fieber's maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. It typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters with a broad, rounded crown.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, with serrated edges, and the tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fieberi has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fieberi is a rare flowering tree native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it grows in cool, moist environments. It thrives in temperate forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, Acer fieberi is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fieberi is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact size, making it a popular choice for small gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of Acer fieberi involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fieberi is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's health. It acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the nitrogen cycle by supporting symbiotic fungi that aid in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fieberi is a lesser-known maple species that has limited direct culinary use due to its small size and specific habitat.</p>
<p>However, it holds potential for medicinal applications, as some studies suggest its leaves may contain compounds with antioxidant properties. In terms of industrial and economic value, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance, supporting wildlife and forest ecosystems. Culturally, it is not widely recognized as a symbol in human traditions, but it plays a role in the natural heritage of its native regions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer fieberi's primary significance lies in its ecological role rather than direct human use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fieberi has a number of popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Kilmarnock' and 'Pendulum', known for their striking red foliage and unique growth forms.</p>
<p>It is also the parent species of several important hybrids, including the widely cultivated 'Autumn Flame' and 'Red Sunset', which exhibit enhanced fall color and improved hardiness. These cultivars and hybrids are prized for their ornamental value, making them popular choices for gardens and landscapes. Their ability to thrive in various climates contributes to their horticultural importance.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer fieberi plays a significant role in the development of maple cultivars that enhance the aesthetic appeal of arboreal plantings.</p>
