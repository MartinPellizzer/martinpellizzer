                <h1>Acer fieberi</h1>
<p>Acer fieberi, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn shades of yellow, orange, and red in the fall.</p>
<p>Acer fieberi is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fieberi has palmately lobed leaves that are typically three to five lobes, with a maple-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over short distances.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fieberi is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few remote areas within this region, where it grows in cool, humid environments. It thrives in forested areas with well-drained soils at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer fieberi is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique and rare plant species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fieberi is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle involves rapid development in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>
