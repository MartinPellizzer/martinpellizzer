                    <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. pyramidale</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. pyramidale, commonly known as the Irish sycamore or columnar sycamore, is a variant of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit, which makes it ideal for small spaces or urban landscapes. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
