                    <h1>Aristida tenuispica</h1>
<p>Aristida tenuispica, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is adapted to drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize and stabilize sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Aristida tenuispica plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in restoration projects in dryland ecosystems.</p>
