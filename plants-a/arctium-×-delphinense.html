<p>Arctium × delphinense, commonly known as the velvetleaf burdock, is a hybrid plant that combines traits of both Arctium lappa (greater burdock) and Delphinium species.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety underside, and it produces tall, sparsely branched stems topped with purple or blue flowers. Its most distinctive characteristic is the prickly, lobed burrs that form at the base of the flowers, which can adhere to clothing and animal fur.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
