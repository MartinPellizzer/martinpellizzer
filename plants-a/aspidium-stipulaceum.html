<p>Aspidium stipulaceum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a membranous covering.</p>
<p>Aspidium stipulaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
