                <h1>Adiantum anceps</h1>
<p>Adiantum anceps, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bipinnate, with fine, arching pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum anceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum anceps has fronds that are pinnately divided, with a slender, graceful appearance, typically measuring 20â€“30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a delicate, leathery texture and a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is often reddish-brown in color, with a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum anceps is primarily native to Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>This fern species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these South American countries. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Adiantum anceps is often associated with mountainous terrain and is well adapted to the humid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for high-altitude habitats in the Andes and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum anceps was mainly introduced to Florida.</p>
<p>It is a fern species that has been found growing in various habitats across the state. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and wetlands. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
<p>Adiantum anceps is considered an invasive species in some parts of Florida due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
