<p>Atriplex canescens, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semiarid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, spiny leaves that are adapted to minimize transpiration. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Atriplex canescens is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate saline conditions.</p>
