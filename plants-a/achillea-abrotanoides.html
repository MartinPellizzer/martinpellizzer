                <h1>Achillea abrotanoides</h1>
<p>Achillea abrotanoides, commonly known as common yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that typically range from white to pinkish in color. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions makes it a common sight in many temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanoides has basal leaves that are lanceolate or linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color, growing from the base to form a flowering stalk. Its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanoides is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
