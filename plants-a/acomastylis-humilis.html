                <h1>Acomastylis humilis</h1>
<p>Acomastylis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Acomastylis humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis humilis has small, linear, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a narrow, pointed shape.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a compact, low shrub form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis humilis is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean region.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Argentina. This plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas within the Andes Mountains. It is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Andean landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis humilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in gardens, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas where it can thrive in a range of soil types. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is now considered a minor weed in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
