                <h1>Achillea virescens</h1>
<p>Achillea virescens, commonly known as green yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea virescens has compound, basal leaves that are lanceolate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a light green to brownish color, with a slightly hairy texture, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea virescens is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of western and central Europe, where it has been introduced in some areas. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. This species is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea virescens is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of compost in spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact form.</p>
<p>While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with lavender, thyme, and other drought-tolerant plants in companion planting.</p>
