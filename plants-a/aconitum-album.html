                <h1>Aconitum album</h1>
<p>Aconitum album, commonly known as white aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a purple or brownish tint at the base. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its roots contain potent alkaloids that make it highly toxic.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum album has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are large, broad, and deeply lobed, typically with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a dark purple or brown bark that becomes cracked with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, clustered in dense racemes, and are pollinated by insects such as bees; they bloom in late summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum album is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including countries such as Italy, France, Spain, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas along streams and in forested regions. This species is also found in some parts of western Asia, particularly in the Caucasus and Turkey. It prefers well-drained soils and is commonly associated with rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Aconitum album is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum album was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, including ornamental gardening and intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since spread to various regions, often establishing itself in moist, woodland environments. The plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, particularly in regions where it lacks natural predators.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread have included mechanical removal and herbicide application in affected areas.</p>
