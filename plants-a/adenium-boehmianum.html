                <h1>Adenium boehmianum</h1>
<p>Adenium boehmianum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a succulent shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its swollen stem, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged spirally along the stem.</p>
<p>Adenium boehmianum is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional practices in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium boehmianum has thick, fleshy, and often lobed leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a waxy green color and a size ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that is often fissured, and it grows in a basal, bushy form. It produces large, showy flowers that are typically red or pink with a yellow center, arranged in umbels, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are deep and strong, adapted to store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium boehmianum is primarily native to Angola and Namibia.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these countries. The plant thrives in dry, rocky landscapes and is commonly seen in savannas and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This species is part of the Adenium genus, known for its unique appearance and ecological significance in African ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium boehmianum was mainly introduced to coastal and riverine areas of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils near water bodies, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny environments. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique, bottle-shaped trunk and striking flowers. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered non-native and not widely spread beyond its initial introduction sites.</p>
