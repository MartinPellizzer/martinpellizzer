<p>Adenium boehmianum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a succulent shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its swollen stem, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged spirally along the stem.</p>
<p>Adenium boehmianum is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional practices in some regions.</p>
