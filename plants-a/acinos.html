                    <h1>Acinos</h1>
<p>Acinos, commonly known as mountain everlasting, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, where they thrive in rocky and alpine environments. Acinos species are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, often silver-gray foliage. They typically produce small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in their propagation across rugged terrain.</p>
<p>Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are used in rock gardens and alpine plantings.</p>
