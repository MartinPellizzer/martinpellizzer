<p>Avena truncata, commonly known as the cut-awn oat, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, truncate (cut-off) awns on its florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it forms dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Avena truncata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
