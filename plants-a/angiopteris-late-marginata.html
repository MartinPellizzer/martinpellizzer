                    <h1>Angiopteris late-marginata</h1>
<p>Angiopteris late-marginata, commonly known as the late-marginated shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The fronds have a distinctive margin with a late-developing, narrow, and often lobed edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
