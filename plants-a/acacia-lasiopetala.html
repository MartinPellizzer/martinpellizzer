                    <h1>Acacia lasiopetala</h1>
<p>Acacia lasiopetala, commonly known as the rough-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Acacia lasiopetala is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
