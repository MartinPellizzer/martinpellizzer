<p>Agathisanthemum globosum var. subglobosum, commonly known as the globe agathisanthemum, is a compact, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance plant well-suited for arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
