                <h1>Acer nigrum</h1>
<p>Acer nigrum, commonly known as the black maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming furrowed with age, and the wood is valued for its strength and durability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven pointed lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are usually 5-10 cm in size, turning bright red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a single trunk. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and greenish-white, appearing in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum is a species of maple native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few scattered populations in the southern Appalachians. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in mixed forests or along stream banks. This species grows at elevations ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer nigrum is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer nigrum includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its early spring flowers. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant, offering protection to smaller plants in the ecosystem. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of forested areas by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed into syrup, though it is less common than that of other maple species. In traditional medicine, various parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. Industrially, it contributes to timber production and provides habitat for wildlife, supporting local economies through forestry and ecotourism.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in regional art and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame,' known for their striking red foliage. Hybrids such as Acer nigrum Ã— trautvetteri have been developed to enhance hardiness and color display. These plants are of significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and visual appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>They are often used in landscaping for their vibrant autumn colors and unique leaf patterns.</p>
