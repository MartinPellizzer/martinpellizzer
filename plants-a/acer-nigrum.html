                <h1>Acer nigrum</h1>
<p>Acer nigrum, commonly known as the black maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters.</p>
<p>The black maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning red or purple in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree or shrub. The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and typically shallow, adapting to moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum is a species of maple native to eastern North America, specifically found in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few regions in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded to partially shaded environments such as woodlands and stream valleys. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer nigrum is considered a species of concern and is listed as threatened or endangered in several states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum is a deciduous tree known for its striking black foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid initial growth followed by a slower maturation phase, typically reaching maturity within 10-15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like rust and leaf spot may occur, necessitating proper care and monitoring.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed borders, enhancing biodiversity in garden ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer nigrum contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a wide range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its bark and leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The tree contributes to the economy through timber and as a source of habitat for wildlife. Culturally, it is often used in landscaping for its vibrant autumn foliage, symbolizing change and resilience.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and providing aesthetic value makes it an important plant in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
