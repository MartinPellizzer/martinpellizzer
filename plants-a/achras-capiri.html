                <h1>Achras capiri</h1>
<p>Achras capiri, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-shaped crown. The plant produces large, clustered fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green and firm. The leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and the bark is thick and fibrous.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras capiri has large, palmately compound leaves that are usually bi- or trifoliate, with a green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, greyish bark that exudes a milky sap when damaged. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras capiri is primarily native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas and dry forests. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone soils. It is known for its unique appearance, featuring a spiny trunk and large, palm-like leaves.</p>
<p>The species is also cultivated in some parts of the world for its ornamental value and fruit production.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras capiri was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and along shores where it thrives in saline and brackish water conditions. The plant is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental fruit and has been cultivated in some regions for agricultural purposes.</p>
