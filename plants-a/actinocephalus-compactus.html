                <h1>Actinocephalus compactus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus compactus, commonly known as the compact star-twig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, dense, and often branched stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus compactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus compactus has small, rounded leaves that are clustered at the base of the plant, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like surface that is typically brown in color. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its sandy or rocky habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus compactus is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape Province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique type of shrubland ecosystem. This plant thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with rocky soils and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus compactus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has established itself in natural and semi-natural environments. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. It forms dense mats that can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it poses a significant ecological threat.</p>
