<p>Aechmea xiphophylla, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and it produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Aechmea xiphophylla thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to grow without soil make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
