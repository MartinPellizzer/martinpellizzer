                <h1>Acanthus pubescens</h1>
<p>Acanthus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy acanthus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features striking, palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces tall, spiky inflorescences topped with small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Its architectural form and historical association with classical art and architecture add to its botanical and cultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus pubescens has leaves that are deeply lobed, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged oppositely along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are spiky and clustered in terminal panicles, featuring purple to violet bracts that bloom in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus pubescens is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife and Gran Canaria.</p>
<p>While it was once found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered extinct in the wild. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments with well-drained soils, often growing in sunny, exposed areas. This species is typically found at altitudes between 300 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and decline in population, Acanthus pubescens is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus pubescens is a striking, evergreen shrub native to South Africa, known for its large, velvety leaves and showy spires of purple flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with regular watering during the growing season. Fertilize it with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune back spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or santolina for aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus pubescens is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, spiny flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its dense foliage. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
