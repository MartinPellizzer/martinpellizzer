                <h1>Achillea portae</h1>
<p>Achillea portae, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea portae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea portae has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a smooth, slightly hairy texture, with a reddish-brown color that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are compound, forming flat-topped clusters called cymes, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>
