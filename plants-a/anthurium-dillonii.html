                    <h1>Anthurium dillonii</h1>
<p>Anthurium dillonii, commonly known as the "Coral Bells" plant, is a striking tropical species native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that range in color from deep red to orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices that are surrounded by the showy bracts, a common feature in the Araceae family. Anthurium dillonii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes.</p>
