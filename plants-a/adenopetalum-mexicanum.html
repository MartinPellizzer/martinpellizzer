                <h1>Adenopetalum mexicanum</h1>
<p>Adenopetalum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican adenopetalum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum mexicanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum mexicanum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum mexicanum is primarily native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States, including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in limestone soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely concentrated in the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum mexicanum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Texas, Louisiana, and Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological disruption in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
