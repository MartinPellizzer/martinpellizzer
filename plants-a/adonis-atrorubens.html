                <h1>Adonis atrorubens</h1>
<p>Adonis atrorubens, commonly known as the black-red adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, deep red to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stalks and are composed of five petals that curve backward, creating a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adonis atrorubens is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis atrorubens has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, with a narrow, elongated shape and an alternate arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching towards the top. The flowers are yellow with a distinctive red center, arranged in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis atrorubens is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats, such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly soils. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It is particularly associated with areas that have a dry summer and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis atrorubens was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the western United States, as an ornamental plant due to its striking red flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several states, including California, Oregon, and Washington. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, allowing it to spread rapidly in certain regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to compete with native flora in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a noxious weed in some states because of its invasive tendencies.</p>
