                <h1>Acer tutcheri subsp. angustilobum</h1>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a serrated edge.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, red-orange flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its autumn color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>angustilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersing by wind after maturing in late summer.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>angustilobum is a rare, small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, with some plants also found in northern Vietnam. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes, often growing at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>angustilobum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall color and unique foliage. It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer or by seeds sown in early spring. The growth cycle of this species is relatively slow, with steady development over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be moderate, with a balanced fertilizer applied in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or evergreens can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>angustilobum is a valuable component of its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its nectar and pollen attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest understories, enhancing the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a range of fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>angustilobum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter leaves and non-edible fruits. While it is not widely used in traditional medicine, some local communities may use its leaves for minor herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Its role in industrial applications is minimal, as it does not provide significant timber or raw materials for economic purposes. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions where it is appreciated for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely ecological and ornamental rather than widespread in practical use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>angustilobum has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Crimson Sentry' and 'Red Sunset' being among the most popular for their striking autumn color. While natural hybrids are rare, it has been crossed with other maple species to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced foliage and form.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf shape and vibrant fall display make it a valuable addition to horticultural collections. Although not as widely cultivated as other maples, it is appreciated for its aesthetic qualities in specialized gardens.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its potential for breeding programs aimed at developing new, hardy maple cultivars.</p>
