<p>Absinthium congestum, commonly known as clustered wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains high concentrations of thujone, a compound responsible for its distinctive and often bitter aroma. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in the production of absinthe and other herbal remedies.</p>
