<p>Acacia hirta var. shrevei, commonly known as the Shreve acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in compact, spherical clusters. The leaves are typically bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny, hair-like leaflets that give the plant a feathery appearance. This species is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
