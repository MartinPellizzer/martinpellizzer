                <h1>Acinodendron delicatulum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide range of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a delicate, sometimes hairy texture.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron delicatulum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slight ribbing, and it grows upright with a bushy habit. The flowers are clustered in small inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron delicatulum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall throughout the year. It is often seen growing near the forest floor, in shaded understory conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron delicatulum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been primarily through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has established itself in several non-native regions where it can compete with native flora.</p>
