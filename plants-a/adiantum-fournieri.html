                <h1>Adiantum fournieri</h1>
<p>Adiantum fournieri, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are bi-directionally branching, and the sori, where spores are produced, are located on the underside of the leaflets.</p>
<p>Adiantum fournieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fournieri has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, measuring up to 30 cm in length, with a light green color that turns bronze in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the foliage. Adiantum fournieri does not produce showy flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, reproducing through sporangia rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fournieri is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a species of fern that occurs in the tropical rainforests of this French overseas territory. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments within the island's mountainous regions. It is well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of New Caledonia, which include nutrient-poor soils and a subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fournieri was mainly introduced to regions with moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and greenhouses. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is sometimes considered an invasive species.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
