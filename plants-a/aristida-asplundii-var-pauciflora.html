                    <h1>Aristida asplundii var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Aristida asplundii var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear few flowers, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>
