<p>Adesmia gayana, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption.</p>
<p>Adesmia gayana is also known for its milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the Fabaceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia gayana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
