                <h1>Adenocarpus brutius</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus brutius, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus brutius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus brutius has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus brutius is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in open grasslands and woodland areas, often found in regions with a warm and humid climate. This plant is commonly associated with the East African savanna ecosystem. It is well adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus brutius is also occasionally found in parts of southern Arabia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus brutius was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, quarries, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. The plant is known for its ability to colonize disturbed areas quickly, making it a common weed in many parts of its range. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities that create new habitats.</p>
<p>It is now found in several countries across Africa and the Middle East.</p>
