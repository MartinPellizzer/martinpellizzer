                <h1>Adenanthos cygnorum</h1>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum, commonly known as the Grey Kangaroo Paw, is a striking evergreen shrub native to south-western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, paw-like flowers that are typically greyish or pink in color, with a prominent central spur. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the south-west region of the state, particularly in the coastal and near-coastal areas. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal heathlands. It is a small shrub that thrives in the temperate climate of this region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of horticultural and ornamental plantings.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils, particularly in the southern regions of the state. The plant is valued for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study.</p>
