<p>Agave sullivanii, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage with white-tipped leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces an impressive, spiky flower stalk that can reach several feet in height, bearing white or pale blue flowers. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Agave sullivanii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
