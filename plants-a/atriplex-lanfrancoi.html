                    <h1>Atriplex lanfrancoi</h1>
<p>Atriplex lanfrancoi, commonly known as the Lanfranco's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex lanfrancoi plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
