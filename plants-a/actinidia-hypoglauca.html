                <h1>Actinidia hypoglauca</h1>
<p>Actinidia hypoglauca, commonly known as the fuzzy white kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a hairy, fuzzy, elongated berry that turns brown when ripe.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and as a source of edible fruit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia hypoglauca has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes whitish underside; they are alternate in arrangement and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern through aerial roots. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, greenish-yellow berry that turns red when ripe, containing several seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia hypoglauca is primarily native to eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate forests and mountainous regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This species is commonly found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of northern Vietnam and southern Korea.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its edible fruit and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia hypoglauca was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moderate humidity and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. This plant is particularly suited for gardens and landscapes in the northern hemisphere, including parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Its introduction has been driven by horticultural interest and its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
