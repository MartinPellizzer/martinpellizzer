                    <h1>Asplenium australe</h1>
<p>Asplenium australe, commonly known as the Australian spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium australe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a hardy, low-maintenance plant.</p>
