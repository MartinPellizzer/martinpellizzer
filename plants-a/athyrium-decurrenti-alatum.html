<p>Athyrium decurrenti-alatum, commonly known as the spreading lady fern, is a fern species native to Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching and gracefully drooping, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bright green, with a finely divided structure that gives it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Athyrium decurrenti-alatum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland settings.</p>
