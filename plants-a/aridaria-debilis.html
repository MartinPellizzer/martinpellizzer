<p>Aridaria debilis, commonly known as the brittle desert grass, is a low-growing perennial plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that minimize water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert regions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh climates.</p>
