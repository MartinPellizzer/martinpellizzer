<p>Acinodendron ovatum, commonly known as the round-leaf acinodendron, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely on the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, spherical berries that turn red when mature, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron ovatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ovatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbellate inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ovatum is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It typically grows in lowland and foothill areas, often in the undergrowth of dense forests. The species is found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is currently listed as near threatened.</p>
