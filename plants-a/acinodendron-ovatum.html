                <h1>Acinodendron ovatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron ovatum, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a velvety texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ovatum has compound leaves that are pinnate, with elliptical to ovate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated margin. The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ovatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist mountainous areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and partial to full shade. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes parts of Malaysia and New Guinea as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ovatum was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed areas, roadsides, and degraded forests across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces have led to its spread beyond cultivated areas. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful monitoring is needed to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
