                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. acuminatidens</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. acuminatidens, commonly known as the sharp-lobed ladyâ€™s mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or white. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to attract beneficial insects.</p>
