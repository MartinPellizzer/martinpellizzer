                    <h1>Arceuthobium oxycedri var. oxycedri</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium oxycedri var. oxycedri, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects juniper trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white berries that are dispersed by animals. It forms dense clusters on the branches of its host, often leading to reduced growth and vitality in the host tree.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of North America and is an important component of certain forest ecosystems.</p>
