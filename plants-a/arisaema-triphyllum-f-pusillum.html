                    <h1>Arisaema triphyllum f. pusillum</h1>
<p>Arisaema triphyllum f. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf Indian turnip, is a rare and distinctive variant of the eastern arrowhead plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and unique, umbrella-like inflorescence that resembles a crown. The plant features a single, broad, heart-shaped leaf with a waxy surface and a deep green color. Its flowering structure consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>This form is less common than the typical variety and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands across the southeastern United States.</p>
