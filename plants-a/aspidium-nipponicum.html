                    <h1>Aspidium nipponicum</h1>
<p>Aspidium nipponicum, commonly known as Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often used in traditional Japanese gardens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium nipponicum is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
