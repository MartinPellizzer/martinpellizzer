                <h1>Actinodaphne heterophylla</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from elliptical to ovate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers and berries, which are an important part of its reproductive cycle. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in traditional medicine and aromatherapy.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne heterophylla has elliptical to ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves vary in size, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne heterophylla is primarily native to the Indo-Malayan region, including parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical rainforests, often in lowland areas with high humidity. It prefers shaded environments and is commonly found in the understorey of dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with humid, warm climates and is not widely distributed beyond this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne heterophylla was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Caribbean. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and lowland environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
