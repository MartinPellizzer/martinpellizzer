                    <h1>Aotus wuerthii</h1>
<p>Aotus wuerthii, commonly known as the WÃ¼rth's owl monkey, is a species of New World primate native to the humid forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive facial features, including prominent cheekbones and a large, round head. The plant associated with this species is not a plant but a primate, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, the query is based on a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
