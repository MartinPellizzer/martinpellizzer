                <h1>Adiantum stellatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum stellatum, commonly known as the starry maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features intricate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive star-shaped appearance, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nighttime pollination.</p>
<p>Adiantum stellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum stellatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically measuring 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dark brown, club-shaped sorus containing spores rather than seeds, and the plant does not produce true fruits or seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum stellatum is primarily native to Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is often associated with limestone substrates and can be found in both coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Guatemala, where it grows in diverse microhabitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum stellatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream sides. This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate, star-shaped fronds. Its introduction has been primarily through human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental spread.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated.</p>
