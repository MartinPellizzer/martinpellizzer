                <h1>Actinidia liangguangensis</h1>
<p>Actinidia liangguangensis, commonly known as the Liangguang actinidia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Actinidiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China, specifically found in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. This vine produces small, greenish-white flowers and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves. The plant is often grown for its ornamental value and has potential uses in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia liangguangensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside; they are medium in size, typically measuring around 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a climbing vine with tendrils. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that contains multiple seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia liangguangensis is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia liangguangensis was mainly introduced to China, where it is native to the mountainous regions of Guangxi and Guangdong provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in humid, subtropical forests at moderate elevations. It is characterized by its fragrant white flowers and edible, hairy fruits that are highly valued in local cuisine. Due to its ornamental and culinary significance, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and home gardens across the country.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other Actinidia species.</p>
