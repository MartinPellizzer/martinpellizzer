                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. iveryanum</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. iveryanum, commonly known as the Ivey's lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'iveryanum' refers to its distinctive appearance, which is often considered more refined than the typical form.</p>
