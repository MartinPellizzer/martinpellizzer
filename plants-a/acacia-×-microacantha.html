                        <h1>Acacia × microacantha</h1>
<p>Acacia × microacantha, commonly known as the hybrid acacia, is a cross between Acacia aneura and Acacia microphyla.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to Australia, characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, phyllodes that are often green and sometimes have a reddish tinge.

<p>The hybrid is known for its adaptability and ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia × microacantha is primarily native to Australia, specifically the western and southern regions.</p>
<p>This hybrid species arises from the cross between Acacia aneura and Acacia microacantha var. microacantha. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, including parts of Western Australia and South Australia. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the natural ranges of its parent species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia × microacantha was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of the Mediterranean, parts of southern Africa, and the southwestern United States. This hybrid plant thrives in full sun and is known for its distinctive, feathery foliage and yellow flowers.
