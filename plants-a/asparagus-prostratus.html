                    <h1>Asparagus prostratus</h1>
<p>Asparagus prostratus, commonly known as creeping asparagus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by edible, needle-like berries. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems.</p>
<p>Asparagus prostratus is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
