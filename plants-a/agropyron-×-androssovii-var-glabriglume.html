<p>Agropyron × androssovii var. glabriglume, commonly known as the smooth glume wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the steppes of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often glabrous, or smooth, giving it its specific variety name. It is a perennial grass with narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically shorter than those of its parent species.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in marginal lands.</p>
