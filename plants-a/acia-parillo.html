                <h1>Acia parillo</h1>
<p>Acia parillo, commonly known as the Parillo acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for dry, rocky landscapes.</p>
<p>Acia parillo is often used in traditional landscaping and has cultural significance in local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acia parillo has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acia parillo is primarily native to the island of Sicily, Italy.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats along the southern coasts of the island. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in dry, sunny environments. It is a hardy species that has adapted to the Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Acia parillo is also occasionally found in parts of southern Italy and the surrounding islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acia parillo was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, often near coastal regions or in tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a successful invader in new regions. It is often considered a weed due to its competitive nature and potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in regions where it has become naturalized.</p>
