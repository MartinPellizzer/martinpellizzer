<p>Aulacophyllum lindenii, commonly known as the Lindberg's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Aulacophyllum lindenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
