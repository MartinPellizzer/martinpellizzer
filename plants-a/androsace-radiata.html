                    <h1>Androsace radiata</h1>
<p>Androsace radiata, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, alpine environment. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Androsace radiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
