<p>Androsace nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>weygaertii, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the snow has fully melted. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
