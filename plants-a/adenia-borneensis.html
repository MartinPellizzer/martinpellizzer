                <h1>Adenia borneensis</h1>
<p>Adenia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean Adenia, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with five sepals and five petals, often in shades of red and yellow. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains multiple seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia borneensis is typically found in humid, lowland forests and thrives in warm, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia borneensis has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are large, showy, and consist of five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, displaying a vibrant yellow or orange color, and they bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia borneensis is primarily native to Borneo, specifically found in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and montane forest areas. This plant is commonly found in secondary growth and along riverbanks, where it benefits from the rich, moist soil. Its distribution is limited to the island of Borneo, with no known occurrence outside this region.</p>
<p>Adenia borneensis is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of the region's ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia borneensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with warm temperatures year-round. This plant is often found in shaded undergrowth near rivers or in forested areas. It has been introduced to various parts of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
