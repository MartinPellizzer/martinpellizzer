                        <h1>Acacia armillata</h1>
<p>Acacia armillata, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow floral spikes, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Acacia armillata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>It is also an important plant in Australian ecosystems and holds cultural significance for Indigenous Australians.</p>
