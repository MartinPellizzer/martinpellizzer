                        <h1>Acantholimon assadii</h1>
<p>Acantholimon assadii, commonly known as the Assad's thornscale, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its blooming period occurs during the spring, producing pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon assadii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with specialized adaptations such as salt tolerance and vivid flowers. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly found in arid and saline environments, known for their often blue or purple flowers. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon assadii, a specific plant species native to certain regions of the Middle East, known for its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon assadii is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of these areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Iran.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon assadii was mainly introduced to areas with rocky soils and arid conditions, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Levant and parts of the Middle East, where it thrives in dry, well-drained environments. This plant is often associated with limestone and sandstone substrates, making it a characteristic species of rocky habitats. Its introduction to these regions is largely due to its natural distribution and adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
