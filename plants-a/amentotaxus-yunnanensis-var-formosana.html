                    <h1>Amentotaxus yunnanensis var. formosana</h1>
<p>Amentotaxus yunnanensis var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan yew, is a rare and endangered coniferous species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that mature into red-brown, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for certain bird species. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
