                <h1>Adenostephanus inaequalis</h1>
<p>Adenostephanus inaequalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf chia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible seeds that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are used in traditional culinary practices. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus inaequalis has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus inaequalis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape Province, where it thrives in fynbos vegetation. This plant is commonly associated with coastal and mountainous regions, often growing on rocky outcrops. It is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenostephanus inaequalis is an important component of the local flora and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus inaequalis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is particularly common in the western United States, including California and Oregon. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
