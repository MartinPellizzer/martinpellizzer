                        <h1>Abutilon domingense</h1>
<p>Abutilon domingense, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon domingense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon domingense is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, mangroves, and other moist, tropical environments. It is commonly associated with sandy or brackish soils near the coast.</p>
<p>Abutilon domingense is often seen in wetlands and estuaries, where it thrives in the humid and saline conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon domingense was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly during the colonial period.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the Caribbean and Central America. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its successful establishment in these environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
