                    <h1>Alsophila caracasana var. petiolularis</h1>
<p>Alsophila caracasana var. petiolularis, commonly known as the Caracas hakea, is a fern native to South America, particularly Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
