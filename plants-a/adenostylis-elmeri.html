                <h1>Adenostylis elmeri</h1>
<p>Adenostylis elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's adenostylis, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Adenostylis elmeri plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylis elmeri has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis elmeri is primarily native to coastal areas of central and southern California, including parts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as dunes, scrublands, and coastal bluffs. It is often associated with the coastal sage scrub ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where it has adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of the coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis elmeri was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the northern and central regions. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dunes and coastal scrub. It has been reported in several conservation areas where it is considered a potential threat to native flora.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, possibly as a contaminant in imported plant material.</p>
