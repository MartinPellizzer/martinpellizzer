<p>Abies concolor var. martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's white fir, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white fir species.</p>
<p>It is native to the high elevations of the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. This evergreen conifer has needle-like leaves that are typically light green with a subtle blue tint. Its cones are cylindrical and have a distinctive shape, often maturing to a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and is adapted to cold, moist environments with well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies concolor var. martinezii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is found in high-elevation mountainous regions, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Ranges. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with coniferous forests and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies concolor var. martinezii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high elevation forests and mountainous regions where it thrives in cool, moist environments. This variant is known for its distinctive blue-green foliage and conical shape, making it a popular ornamental plant. It has been introduced to various ecological zones, including mixed coniferous forests.</p>
