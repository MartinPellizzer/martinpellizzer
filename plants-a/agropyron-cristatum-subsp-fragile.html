<p>Agropyron cristatum subsp.</p>
<p>fragile, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
