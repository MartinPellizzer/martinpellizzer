                <h1>Acourtia durangensis</h1>
<p>Acourtia durangensis, commonly known as the Durango acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acourtia durangensis is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia durangensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a compact, shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia durangensis is primarily native to the northeastern region of Mexico.</p>
<p>This species is found in the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and San Luis Potosí. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on limestone outcrops. The plant is adapted to the dry and warm climate of this region.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and is typically found in scrublands and open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia durangensis was mainly introduced to specific regions of Mexico, particularly the state of Durango, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species, found primarily in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species and its natural habitat.</p>
