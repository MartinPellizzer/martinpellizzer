<p>Aspidium subtriphyllum var. cuspidatopinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that have pointed tips.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
