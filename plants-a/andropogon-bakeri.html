<p>Andropogon bakeri, commonly known as Baker's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Baker's bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetlands effectively.</p>
