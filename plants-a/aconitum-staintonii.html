                    <h1>Aconitum staintonii</h1>
<p>Aconitum staintonii, commonly known as Stainton's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern and southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a dense, spire-like inflorescence. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that distinguishes it from other aconite species.</p>
<p>Aconitum staintonii contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
