                <h1>Acrostichum grande</h1>
<p>Acrostichum grande, commonly known as the giant swamp fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with long, arching fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its leaves are sometimes used as thatch or for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical structure includes a central stem with multiple branching fronds, each bearing small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum grande has large, pinnately compound leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green on top, and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it spread and stabilize in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum grande is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove swamps and estuaries. This plant thrives in brackish water environments and is often associated with salt marshes. It is also present in some Caribbean islands and along the Atlantic coast of North America.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to wetland habitats where it can tolerate fluctuating salinity levels.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum grande was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it can thrive in moist, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant has been established in several coastal states along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Its introduction has led to its spread along shorelines and in marshy habitats.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
