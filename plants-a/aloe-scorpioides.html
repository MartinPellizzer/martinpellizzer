                    <h1>Aloe scorpioides</h1>
<p>Aloe scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpion aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves contain a gel that is sometimes used for topical applications, though it is less common than in other aloe species.</p>
<p>Aloe scorpioides is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens.</p>
