                <h1>Acinos diffusus</h1>
<p>Acinos diffusus, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically divided into five narrow lobes. Acinos diffusus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos diffusus has leaves that are oblong to ovate in shape, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, often sprawling or ascending, with a slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color. The flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos diffusus is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Utah. This plant thrives in rocky and dry environments, often growing in mountainous areas. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a characteristic species of the Great Basin and other desert-like regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos diffusus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high elevations and a temperate climate. This plant is often found in regions with well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. It has been reported in several states across the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread quickly in new environments, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
