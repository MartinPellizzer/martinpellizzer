                    <h1>Alexitoxicon contiguum</h1>
<p>Alexitoxicon contiguum, commonly known as the trembling ghostplant, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Alexitoxicon contiguum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
