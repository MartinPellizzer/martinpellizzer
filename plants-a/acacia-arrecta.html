                        <h1>Acacia arrecta</h1>
<p>Acacia arrecta, commonly known as the feverfew tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia arrecta is adapted to arid environments and is often found in savannas and rocky areas.</p>
<p>It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though its use is less common today.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia arrecta belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of secondary cell walls and complex vascular systems. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore-based reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that often have legume fruits and are important for nitrogen fixation. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their compound leaves and often thorny structures, commonly found in arid and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia arrecta, a specific type of acacia known for its upright growth habit and is native to parts of Africa, often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia arrecta is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandy soils of the state. This plant thrives in dry, temperate climates and is often seen in shrublands and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Acacia arrecta plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic species of the West Australian flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia arrecta was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and capacity to provide shade and forage for livestock. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands in parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native ecosystems.</p>
