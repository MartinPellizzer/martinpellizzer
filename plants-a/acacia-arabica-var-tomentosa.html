<p>Acacia arabica var. tomentosa, commonly known as the white acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, greyish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia arabica var. tomentosa has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in pairs along the central axis, giving the foliage a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually pale green, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form. The flowers are yellow, arranged in globular inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a flat, woody pod that splits open to release small, angular seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
