                    <h1>Aconitum velutinum</h1>
<p>Aconitum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety down, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
