<p>Arrhenatherum longum, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and inflorescences that consist of dense, spike-like clusters of purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and along the edges of bogs. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils.</p>
