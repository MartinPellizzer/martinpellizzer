It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmicoides f. rosea has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmicoides f. rosea is a cultivar of a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, it is now cultivated in gardens and botanical collections around the world, especially in temperate climates. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations remain limited, making it a species of interest for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmicoides f. rosea is a compact, flowering perennial known for its soft pink blooms and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, becoming active in spring and blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize lightly in early spring and prune spent flowers to encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its ornamental value and promotes beneficial insect activity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmicoides f. rosea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its bright pink flowers attract a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This plant also supports ecological balance by offering shelter and habitat for small insects and beneficial organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmicoides f. rosea is a decorative plant commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and floral arrangements due to its attractive pinkish-red flowers.</p>
