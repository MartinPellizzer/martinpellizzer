                    <h1>Anthericum hypoxiforme</h1>
<p>Anthericum hypoxiforme, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in marshy areas.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Anthericum hypoxiforme make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
