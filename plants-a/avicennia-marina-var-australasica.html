                    <h1>Avicennia marina var. australasica</h1>
<p>Avicennia marina var. australasica, commonly known as the Australian mangrove, is a halophyte species adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, including estuaries and tidal mudflats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its small, smooth leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly common in the coastal regions of Australia and is vital for ecosystem health in intertidal zones.</p>
