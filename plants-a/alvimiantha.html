                    <h1>Alvimiantha</h1>
<p>Alvimiantha, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots make it drought-resistant, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
<p>Alvimiantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
