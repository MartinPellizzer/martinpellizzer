                <h1>Acharagma huasteca</h1>
<p>Acharagma huasteca, commonly known as the Huastec mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is typically found growing on the branches of oak and other broad-leaved trees. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Acharagma huasteca plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acharagma huasteca has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green color, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length, and have a slightly serrated margin. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that develops a rough texture as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acharagma huasteca is a flowering plant native to Mexico, specifically found in the states of Hidalgo, Puebla, and Tamaulipas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra Madre del Norte mountain range. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, often growing in shaded understories of forests. Acharagma huasteca is typically found at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acharagma huasteca is a lesser-known but valuable plant native to Mexico, known for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the desired characteristics. The growth cycle of Acharagma huasteca involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and promote new blooms.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions, making proper care and companion planting with marigolds or lavender beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acharagma huasteca is a native plant of Mexico that provides food and shelter for various local wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the ecosystem. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in its vicinity. Additionally, its deep root system helps with erosion control, stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acharagma huasteca plays a vital role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitat.</p>
