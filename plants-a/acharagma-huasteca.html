                <h1>Acharagma huasteca</h1>
<p>Acharagma huasteca, commonly known as Huastec nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and purple or black berries that contain toxic compounds. It is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food or ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acharagma huasteca has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves vary in size, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, and are often slightly hairy. The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule containing small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached tufts.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acharagma huasteca is a plant native to Central America, specifically found in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is primarily limited to the southern parts of Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Veracruz. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in shaded, moist areas within dense forests. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and deforestation, leading to its classification as vulnerable by some conservation organizations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acharagma huasteca is a unique and relatively rare plant native to Mexico, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acharagma huasteca includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, but it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by aphids or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acharagma huasteca is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring vegetation through mutualistic relationships. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its environment.</p>
