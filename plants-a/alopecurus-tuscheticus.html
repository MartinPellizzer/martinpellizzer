<p>Alopecurus tuscheticus, commonly known as the Tuscan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Alopecurus tuscheticus is often found in calcareous soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity.</p>
