                <h1>Adenoncos triloba</h1>
<p>Adenoncos triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed adenoncos, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenoncos triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos triloba has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate in shape, smooth on the upper surface, and slightly hairy on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos triloba is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest regions. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. The species is known for its distinctive three-lobed leaves and is commonly found in primary and secondary forest habitats.</p>
<p>Adenoncos triloba plays an important ecological role in the biodiversity of Borneo's flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos triloba was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, construction sites, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rehabilitation projects. Its rapid growth and ability to establish dense stands contribute to its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, its use is often limited due to its short lifespan and the need for frequent reseeding.</p>
