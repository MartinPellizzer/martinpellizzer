                <h1>Acer pictum subsp. macropterum</h1>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>macropterum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>macropterum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes whitish or rusty underside. The stems are slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow as upright shrubs or small trees.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>macropterum is a rare maple species native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and Asia, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, typically found in mixed hardwood forests. This species grows at elevations ranging from 100 to 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, it is considered endangered or critically endangered in its native range, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>macropterum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique winged seeds. It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, with a growth cycle that includes active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>macropterum is a valuable native tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality, offering multiple ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>macropterum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species, though it is less common.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it has been traditionally used by Indigenous peoples for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Industrially, the tree contributes to local economies through timber and habitat support for wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in the regions where it is native, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>macropterum has several popular cultivars, including 'Orangeola' and 'Crimson Queen', which are prized for their vibrant foliage and compact growth habits. It is also commonly hybridized with other maples, such as Acer x freemanii, to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced color and adaptability.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and showier fall color, making them highly sought after in horticulture. The species and its cultivars are valued for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a range of garden settings.</p>
<p>Due to their visual impact, they hold significant horticultural importance in landscaping and ornamental gardening.</p>
