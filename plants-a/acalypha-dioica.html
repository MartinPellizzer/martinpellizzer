                    <h1>Acalypha dioica</h1>
<p>Acalypha dioica, commonly known as the Indian mallow or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same plant. Acalypha dioica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in some regions.</p>
