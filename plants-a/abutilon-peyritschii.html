                        <h1>Abutilon peyritschii</h1>
<p>Abutilon peyritschii, commonly known as the Peyritsch's velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon peyritschii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon peyritschii is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it thrives in humid and tropical conditions. This species is often associated with sandy or well-drained soils, making it a characteristic plant of coastal ecosystems. It is also present in parts of southern Florida, where it has been introduced but remains primarily native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its distinctive velvety leaves and showy yellow flowers, which contribute to its ecological and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon peyritschii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its unique, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves. The plant has since become naturalized in several areas, particularly in moist, disturbed habitats. It is often found growing along stream banks and in wetlands.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
