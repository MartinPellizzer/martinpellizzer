                    <h1>Alyssum tortuosum var. longistylum</h1>
<p>Alyssum tortuosum var. longistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Its flowers are borne on slender, branching stems that rise above the foliage, enhancing its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
