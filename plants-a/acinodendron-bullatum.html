                <h1>Acinodendron bullatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron bullatum, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron bullatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive flowers and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bullatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bullatum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions' dense vegetation. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing along riverbanks and in swampy regions. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right combination of moisture and light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its native range has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bullatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the introduction of exotic plant species for horticultural purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
