                <h1>Achillea aleppica subsp. altinozlui</h1>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>altinozlui, commonly known as the Aleppo thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish-red flower heads.</p>
<p>Native to the Mediterranean region, this subspecies thrives in rocky and dry environments. The plant produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>altinozlui has narrow, linear leaves that are grass-like in appearance, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a light green to brownish color.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, and range in color from white to pale yellow, blooming from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus of silky hairs, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>altinozlui is a rare subspecies native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of Turkey. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Taurus Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, dry, and sunny environments, often growing on slopes and among limestone formations. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>altinozlui is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, with the first year focusing on root development and the second year producing flowers and seeds.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its form and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>altinozlui is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting the growth of other plant species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>altinozlui is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily found in specific regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Turkey. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential for use in local herbal infusions or as a flavoring agent in traditional recipes.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it may possess anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial properties, though research on its therapeutic uses is limited. Industrially, it could contribute to ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in marginal soils.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions or folklore, though its role in cultural symbolism remains underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>altinozlui has several popular cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities, such as 'Alta' and 'Golden Glow,' which display striking yellow to golden foliage. While it is not widely used for hybridization due to its limited cultivation, some crosses with other *Achillea* species have produced plants with enhanced hardiness and color variation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly important in horticulture for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its long-lasting, drought-tolerant nature. Its unique appearance makes it a desirable addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, it contributes to the diversity of the *Achillea* genus in both ecological and aesthetic contexts.</p>
