                    <h1>Aristida adscensionis var. abortiva</h1>
<p>Aristida adscensionis var. abortiva, commonly known as the abortive lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The variety 'abortiva' is distinguished by its reduced flowering structures, which may contribute to its unique ecological role.</p>
