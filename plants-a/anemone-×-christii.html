<p>Anemone × christii, commonly known as the hybrid anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting center. The plant typically grows to a height of 15–30 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic.
