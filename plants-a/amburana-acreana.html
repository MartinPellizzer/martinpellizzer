<p>Amburana acreana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a high oil content, which makes it highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
