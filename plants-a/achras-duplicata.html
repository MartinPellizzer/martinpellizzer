                <h1>Achras duplicata</h1>
<p>Achras duplicata, commonly known as the double-leaf achiote, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are divided into two lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves and seeds of Achras duplicata have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras duplicata has palmate leaves that are large, typically reaching up to 1 meter in diameter, with a bright green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant, providing a dense canopy. The stem is thick, short, and covered with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras duplicata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky soils. It is known for its distinctive appearance, with a tall, spiny stem and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras duplicata was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its large, waxy leaves and distinctive fruit. Despite its ornamental value, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant is also sometimes used in traditional medicine in its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
