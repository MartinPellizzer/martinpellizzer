                <h1>Achras duplicata</h1>
<p>Achras duplicata, commonly known as the double-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in pairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras duplicata has large, palmate leaves that are typically lobed, with a bright green color and a smooth texture, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and short, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically brown or gray in color. It produces large, showy flowers with a yellowish-green color, arranged in clusters, blooming in the spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny capsule that contains seeds dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras duplicata is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in protected areas. It thrives in tropical dry forests and coastal habitats, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achras duplicata is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras duplicata is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for maintaining the plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Achras duplicata is typically slow, with new growth appearing in spring and reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage branching are essential for healthy development. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other drought-tolerant species can enhance its growth in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras duplicata is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil health and supporting other crops. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its deep root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achras duplicata offers ecological benefits by improving habitat structure and promoting a balanced ecosystem.</p>
