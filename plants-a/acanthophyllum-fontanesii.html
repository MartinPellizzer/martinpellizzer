<p>Acanthophyllum fontanesii, commonly known as the desert sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, bristly seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually small and succulent, helping to conserve water in low-resource conditions.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum fontanesii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
