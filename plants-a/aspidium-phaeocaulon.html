<p>Aspidium phaeocaulon, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of many ferns.

<p>Aspidium phaeocaulon is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>
