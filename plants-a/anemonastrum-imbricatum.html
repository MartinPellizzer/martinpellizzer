<p>Anemonastrum imbricatum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-like growth habit, featuring hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum imbricatum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
