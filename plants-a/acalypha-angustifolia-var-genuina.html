<p>Acalypha angustifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-white or reddish in color, and it produces small, dry fruits known as cypsela.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ornamental horticulture for its foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha angustifolia var. genuina has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, often reddish in color, with a smooth texture and exhibit an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers with male and female flowers on separate plants, blooming in the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in moisture retention and stability.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha angustifolia var. genuina is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern rainforests. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and shade. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha angustifolia var. genuina is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth.
