                <h1>Aconitum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Aconitum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough helmet or European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with palmately compound leaves that have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>Aconitum coriaceum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum coriaceum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath, with a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, forming dense, spiky racemes, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a spiral mechanism, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and serve as storage organs, enabling the plant to survive harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum coriaceum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Alps, Carpathians, and Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands, stream banks, and meadows at high elevations. This species is commonly found in countries like Austria, Germany, Italy, and the Czech Republic. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with coniferous or mixed forests.</p>
<p>Aconitum coriaceum is known for its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum coriaceum was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. The plant has become naturalized in several regions, often competing with native species for resources. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it poses a toxic risk to both humans and animals.</p>
