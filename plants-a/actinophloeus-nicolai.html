                <h1>Actinophloeus nicolai</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus nicolai, commonly known as the Nicolo's actinophloeus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in clusters. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus nicolai has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, sandy soils where the plant commonly grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus nicolai is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. It is commonly found in primary and secondary rainforests, often growing near the forest floor or on shaded undergrowth. Due to habitat destruction, its natural range has been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus nicolai was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in urban areas.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
