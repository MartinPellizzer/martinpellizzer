                    <h1>Acacia cretacea</h1>
<p>Acacia cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, phyllodes that are typically green and strap-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by native pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia cretacea is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for traditional and contemporary uses.</p>
