<p>Alsophila schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and helps anchor the plant in moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant in its natural habitat.</p>
