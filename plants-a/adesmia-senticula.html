                <h1>Adesmia senticula</h1>
<p>Adesmia senticula, commonly known as the sweet-smelling legume, is a small, shrub-like plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Adesmia senticula produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties have made it of interest in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia senticula has small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 1-2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia senticula is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant is commonly found in the Chaco region, which spans parts of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Adesmia senticula is an important component of the local flora in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia senticula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in several regions. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often along the west coast. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
