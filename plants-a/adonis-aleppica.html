<p>It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a subtle red or purple tinge. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems and are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adonis aleppica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis aleppica has alternate, basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color, and it grows in a clumping pattern. The flowers are yellow, with a tubular shape and five petals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis aleppica is primarily native to Iraq, Lebanon-Syria, and Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in regions with rocky or limestone soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often seen in mountainous areas. Adonis aleppica is known for its bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis aleppica was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
