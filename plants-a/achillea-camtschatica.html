<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Siberian yarrow is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea camtschatica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and often slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming in summer from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea camtschatica is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Russia, Turkey, and Georgia.</p>
<p>While it was once found in the wild, its current distribution is limited, with most populations now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and meadows. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea camtschatica is a hardy perennial known for its showy yellow flowers and robust growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method ensuring faster establishment. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, thriving in its first year and producing flowers in the second before dying back.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering encourages bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea enhances its ornamental value and promotes beneficial insect activity.</p>
