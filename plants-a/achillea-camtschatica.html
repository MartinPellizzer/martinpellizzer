                        <h1>Achillea camtschatica</h1>
<p>Achillea camtschatica, commonly known as Siberian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces yellowish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed sites. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a soft, woolly layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Achillea camtschatica is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
