<p>It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other soils with high salinity. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and salt accumulation. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal ecosystems.</p>
