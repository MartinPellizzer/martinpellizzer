                    <h1>Archytaea sessilis</h1>
<p>Archytaea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile archytaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels, and its basal leaves are often sessile, meaning they lack stalks. It is typically found in coastal areas and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the carrot family.</p>
