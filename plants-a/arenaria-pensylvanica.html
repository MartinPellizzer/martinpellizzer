                    <h1>Arenaria pensylvanica</h1>
<p>Arenaria pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania sandwort is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
