                    <h1>Astragalus pachyacanthus var. lasiocaulos</h1>
<p>Astragalus pachyacanthus var. lasiocaulos, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.</p>
