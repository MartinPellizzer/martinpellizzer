                    <h1>Azorella lyallii</h1>
<p>Azorella lyallii, commonly known as the Antarctic haircress, is a flowering plant native to the cold, high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, white or greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against extreme weather.</p>
<p>Azorella lyallii plays an important ecological role in its alpine and Antarctic habitats.</p>
