                    <h1>Acaena buchananii var. buchananii</h1>
<p>Acaena buchananii var. buchananii, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of spiny, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red or orange berries. The plant has woody stems and hairy leaves, which are adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. It is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range.</p>
