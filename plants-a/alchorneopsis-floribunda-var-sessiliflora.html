<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
