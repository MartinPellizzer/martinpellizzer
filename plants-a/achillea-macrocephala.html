                <h1>Achillea macrocephala</h1>
<p>Achillea macrocephala, commonly known as giant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, flat-topped clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea macrocephala is known for its long flowering period, typically from late spring to early autumn.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea macrocephala has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, hairy, and grayish-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern, and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are large, compound umbels composed of small white to pale yellow florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling vegetative propagation and anchoring the plant in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea macrocephala is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in temperate regions around the world, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its invasive potential in some areas has led to concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea macrocephala is a hardy perennial known for its showy, spherical yellow flower heads and fragrant foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining its vigor. This plant has a long growing season, blooming in late spring to early summer and thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune faded flower heads to encourage rebloom and maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or echinacea can enhance its growth and provide natural pest deterrence.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea macrocephala is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small invertebrates and can support ecological balance in natural and cultivated environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
