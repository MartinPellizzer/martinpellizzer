                <h1>Acer sutchuenense subsp. tienchuanense</h1>
<p>Acer sutchuenense subsp.</p>
<p>tienchuanense, commonly known as the Tienchuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense subsp.</p>
<p>tienchuanense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, typically ranging from 5 to 12 cm in length and 3 to 6 cm in width. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins, which appear in early spring, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense subsp.</p>
<p>tienchuanense is a rare maple species native to southwestern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. Its current distribution is limited to specific mountainous regions within these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forest understories. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense subsp.</p>
<p>tienchuanense is a rare and ornamental maple species that thrives in specific horticultural conditions. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle involves a slow development phase, reaching maturity over several years, and it prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It requires well-drained soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense subsp.</p>
<p>tienchuanense is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and pollination networks.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports local fauna by offering nesting sites and habitat diversity within its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense subsp.</p>
<p>tienchuanense is a lesser-known maple species primarily valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is occasionally utilized in small-scale crafts and furniture making due to its fine texture and durability.</p>
<p>In traditional Chinese medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. It also holds cultural significance in certain regions, where it is admired for its ornamental value and symbolic representation of resilience.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain limited, but it contributes to biodiversity and local ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense subsp.</p>
<p>tienchuanense has several notable cultivars, including 'Kilimanjaro' and 'Crimson King', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth. It is also commonly used in hybridization to create new varieties with improved hardiness and ornamental traits.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this species often exhibit enhanced adaptability to different climates and extended blooming periods. Due to its attractive foliage and resilience, it holds significant horticultural importance in both landscape design and cultivated collections.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity continues to inspire plant breeders seeking to develop new ornamental maple varieties.</p>
