<p>Andropogon grisebachii, commonly known as gray bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Gray bluestem is also an important forage plant for grazing animals.</p>
