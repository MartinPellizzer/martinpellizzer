<p>Aristida lommelii, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense panicles, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Aristida lommelii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range.</p>
