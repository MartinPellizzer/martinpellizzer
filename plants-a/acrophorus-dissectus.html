                <h1>Acrophorus dissectus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus dissectus, commonly known as the dissected acrophorus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often emit a faintly aromatic scent. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Acrophorus dissectus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus dissectus has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, with a light green color and a delicate, feathery texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus dissectus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in humid, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils, typically within the canopy layer of tropical rainforests. It is also occasionally found in adjacent coastal areas and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus dissectus was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is consistent warmth and humidity, making it suitable for regions with a subtropical climate. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
