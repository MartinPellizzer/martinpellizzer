                <h1>Adiantum serrulatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum serrulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum serrulatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a serrated edge. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Adiantum serrulatum produces inconspicuous, small spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and it does not produce fruits or seeds; instead, it reproduces through spores released from the fronds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum serrulatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and rocky slopes. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mountainous regions. It is also known to occur in parts of northeastern India and southern China.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas within Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum serrulatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and streamside habitats. This plant is often found in association with other native ferns and moisture-loving flora. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a non-native species in many areas where it has become established.</p>
