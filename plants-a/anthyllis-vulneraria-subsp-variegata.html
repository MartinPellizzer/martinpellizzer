<p>Anthyllis vulneraria subsp.</p>
<p>variegata, commonly known as the variegated honey vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal areas and disturbed ground.</p>
<p>Its scientific name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a nectar source for pollinators.</p>
