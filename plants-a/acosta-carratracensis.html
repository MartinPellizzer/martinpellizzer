                <h1>Acosta carratracensis</h1>
<p>Acosta carratracensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair.</p>
<p>Acosta carratracensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta carratracensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds and through epizoochorous means.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soils and allowing the plant to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta carratracensis is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in the departments of La Paz and Potos√≠ in Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, typically between 3,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant is adapted to the cold and arid conditions of the Andes, thriving in areas with low precipitation and intense solar radiation. It is often found in association with other high-altitude flora, such as polylepis trees and various endemic grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Acosta carratracensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta carratracensis was mainly introduced to regions with a temperate climate and well-drained soils, particularly in South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has been linked to human activities like land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in most of its current range.</p>
