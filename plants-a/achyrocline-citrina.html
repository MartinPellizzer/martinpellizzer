                <h1>Achyrocline citrina</h1>
<p>Achyrocline citrina, commonly known as the yellow false geranium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Achyrocline citrina is often found in coastal areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline citrina has simple, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and have a light green color, growing in a creeping or ascending manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline citrina is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and limited cultivation. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils in coastal areas or lowland forests. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 300 meters.</p>
<p>Despite its limited range, Achyrocline citrina is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although conservation efforts are needed to protect its remaining habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrocline citrina is a flowering plant native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering a faster and more reliable method. The plant has a relatively short growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyrocline citrina is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Additionally, its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Achyrocline citrina also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the balance of local ecosystems.</p>
