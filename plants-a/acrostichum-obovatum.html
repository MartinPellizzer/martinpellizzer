                <h1>Acrostichum obovatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf hibiscus, is a member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped, obovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum obovatum has leaves that are obovate in shape, with a broad base and tapering tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 20â€“30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a light green color and a smooth bark. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, blooming from June to August, and is pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum obovatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and mangrove swamps where it thrives in saline or brackish water conditions. This plant is particularly abundant in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of moist, sandy soils and proximity to water bodies.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum obovatum was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water areas in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is commonly found in marshes and estuaries. This plant has become an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species. Its introduction has also led to changes in sediment composition and water flow patterns in these regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
