<p>Arachnorchis longicauda subsp.</p>
<p>eminens, commonly known as the tall spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with intricate, spider-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
