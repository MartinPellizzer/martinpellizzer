                    <h1>Ardisia vaughanii</h1>
<p>Ardisia vaughanii, commonly known as the Vaughan's beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant produces small, clustered, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. Ardisia vaughanii is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it is not widely commercially available.</p>
