<p>Acacia cymbispina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in dense clusters. Its seeds are encased in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Acacia cymbispina is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora.</p>
