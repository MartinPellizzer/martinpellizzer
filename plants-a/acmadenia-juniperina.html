                <h1>Acmadenia juniperina</h1>
<p>Acmadenia juniperina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acmadenia, is a small shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the autumn. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Acmadenia juniperina is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia juniperina has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy green and range in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and often branched, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin flakes. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia juniperina is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is commonly seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Acmadenia juniperina is part of the family Rutaceae, which includes many plants with aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia juniperina was mainly introduced to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This plant is often seen in open forests and shrublands. It has adapted well to the local climate and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is mostly confined to its native range.</p>
