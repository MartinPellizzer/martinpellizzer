                        <h1>Acacia aneura var. major</h1>
<p>Acacia aneura var. major, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, gnarled trunk and long, slender, grey-green leaves that are often shed during dry periods. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by distinctive, flat, bean-like pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>The ghost gum is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in landscaping and reforestation projects.</p>
