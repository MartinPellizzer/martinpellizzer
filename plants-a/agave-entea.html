                    <h1>Agave entea</h1>
<p>Agave entea, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach up to 10 feet in height, bearing clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Agave entea is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its leaves are used in the production of tequila and other agave-based spirits.</p>
