<p>Asplenium cicutarium, commonly known as the harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium cicutarium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
