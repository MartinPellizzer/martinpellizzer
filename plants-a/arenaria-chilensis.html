                    <h1>Arenaria chilensis</h1>
<p>Arenaria chilensis, commonly known as Chilean sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and maritime climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Arenaria chilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
