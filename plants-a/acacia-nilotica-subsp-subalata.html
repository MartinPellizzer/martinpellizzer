<p>Acacia nilotica subsp.</p>
<p>subalata, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel.</p>
