                    <h1>Astragalus humistratus var. sonorae</h1>
<p>Astragalus humistratus var. sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments with low precipitation. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
