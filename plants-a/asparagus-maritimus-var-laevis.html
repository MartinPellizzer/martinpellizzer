                    <h1>Asparagus maritimus var. laevis</h1>
<p>Asparagus maritimus var. laevis, commonly known as smooth sea asparagus, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant features slender, succulent stems that are often covered in a smooth, waxy coating. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and closely packed, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and the plant is valued for its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
