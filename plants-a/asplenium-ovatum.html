<p>Asplenium ovatum, commonly known as the ovate spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, rock crevices, and along stream banks. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in pairs on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium ovatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shady, humid conditions.</p>
