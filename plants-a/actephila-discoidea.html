                <h1>Actephila discoidea</h1>
<p>Actephila discoidea, commonly known as the white-flowered actephila, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Actephila discoidea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila discoidea has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small and clustered, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila discoidea is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this island, which is known for its rich biodiversity. The plant thrives in humid, forested environments. It is commonly observed in lowland and montane areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern and western parts of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila discoidea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, fields, and urban environments. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Due to its adaptability, it has established populations in various regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
