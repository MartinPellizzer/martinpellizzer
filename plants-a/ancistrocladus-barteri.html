                    <h1>Ancistrocladus barteri</h1>
<p>Ancistrocladus barteri, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a thick, sticky coating. It is notable for containing toxic compounds, particularly in its bark and leaves, which have been used traditionally in some regions.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its chemical properties.</p>
