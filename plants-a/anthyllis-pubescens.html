<p>Anthyllis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow or reddish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Anthyllis pubescens thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Its hairy leaves and stems provide a distinctive appearance, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
