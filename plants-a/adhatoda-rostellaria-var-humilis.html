                <h1>Adhatoda rostellaria var. humilis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda rostellaria var. humilis, commonly known as the small-leaved arrowroot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variant is less commonly cultivated than its larger-leaved relatives but is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda rostellaria var. humilis has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 3-6 cm in length and 1.5-3 cm in width.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green to brown bark that has a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda rostellaria var. humilis is a variant of the Adhatoda rostellaria, native to Southeast Asia, particularly India, Sri Lanka, and parts of southern China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions in tropical and subtropical areas, though its presence has become more localized due to habitat loss. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky hillsides. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological importance, it is considered to be of conservation concern due to habitat degradation and limited population sizes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda rostellaria var. humilis is a hardy, aromatic plant commonly cultivated for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes vigorous growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda rostellaria var. humilis is a plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife including birds and small mammals that rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
