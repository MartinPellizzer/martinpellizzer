<p>Armeria alpina subsp.</p>
<p>microcephala, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
