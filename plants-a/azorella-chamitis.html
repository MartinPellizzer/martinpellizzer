                    <h1>Azorella chamitis</h1>
<p>Azorella chamitis, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of Chile.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from below the permafrost layer. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white wax, reducing water loss and protecting against intense UV radiation.</p>
<p>Azorella chamitis is also known for its ability to flower and produce seeds even under extreme climatic conditions.</p>
