                    <h1>Agropyron bulbosum</h1>
<p>Agropyron bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and basal rosette of fleshy, bulbous leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Agropyron bulbosum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
