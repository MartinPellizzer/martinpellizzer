                <h1>Acronychia wilcoxiana</h1>
<p>Acronychia wilcoxiana, commonly known as the Wilcox's acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia wilcoxiana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through bird consumption and scattering.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia wilcoxiana is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>This species is found in the subtropical and tropical regions of eastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal rainforests and moist, shaded environments. The plant is well adapted to the humid and temperate climates of these areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and creek lines in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia wilcoxiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in areas with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and lowland forests where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure. It has been introduced to several islands in the Hawaiian archipelago and parts of French Polynesia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and lack of widespread naturalization.</p>
