                    <h1>Aegilops augeri</h1>
<p>Aegilops augeri, commonly known as the Armenian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Aegilops augeri is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential contributions to wheat genetics and its role in ecological studies.</p>
