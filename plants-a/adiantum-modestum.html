<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to regions of North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant's fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a finely divided, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum modestum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
