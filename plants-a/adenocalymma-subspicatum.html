                <h1>Adenocalymma subspicatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma subspicatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its capsule fruits release seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma subspicatum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma subspicatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma subspicatum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of Piauí, Ceará, and Pernambuco. This plant typically grows in dry and semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. It is adapted to the tropical climate of the region, which is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma subspicatum is a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma subspicatum was mainly introduced to regions with warm, arid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for xerophytic environments. This plant has been introduced to parts of Australia, the United States, and other regions with similar ecological conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects in dry climates.</p>
