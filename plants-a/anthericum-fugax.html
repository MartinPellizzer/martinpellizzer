<p>Anthericum fugax, commonly known as the transient lily, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist habitats effectively.</p>
<p>Anthericum fugax is notable for its short blooming period, which contributes to its common name.</p>
