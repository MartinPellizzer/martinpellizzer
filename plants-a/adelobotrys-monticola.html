                <h1>Adelobotrys monticola</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys monticola, commonly known as the mountain adelobotrys, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes plants known for their milky sap and often showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive corona.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys monticola has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, aiding in water absorption from the moist, shaded habitats where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys monticola is primarily native to Brazil North, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within forests. The species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local biodiversity of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys monticola was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. Its introduction has led to its spread into natural areas, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in both urban and rural landscapes.</p>
