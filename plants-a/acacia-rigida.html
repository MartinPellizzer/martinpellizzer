                    <h1>Acacia rigida</h1>
<p>Acacia rigida, commonly known as the rigid acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional Aboriginal diets. Acacia rigida is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in stabilizing degraded lands.</p>
