                <h1>Actinodaphne scleroptera</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera, commonly known as the rough-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark, fleshy berries. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a slight aromatic scent, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, have a simple structure with five petals, and bloom during the dry season, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that consume the fleshy pulp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of Indonesia. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically in lowland to mid-elevation areas. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is part of the diverse flora of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and parts of French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there through human activity, possibly as an ornamental plant or for traditional purposes. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of these islands. Due to its adaptability, it has established populations in several locations, sometimes becoming invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
