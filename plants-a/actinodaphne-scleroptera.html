<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera, commonly known as the rough-leaved camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark, fleshy berries. Its bark and leaves contain volatile oils, which have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China and the eastern Himalayas, though its range has become fragmented. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland and hill forests. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Actinodaphne scleroptera is considered to be of conservation concern, with limited information on its population trends.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with maturity taking several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Regular fertilization with a balanced NPK mix and light pruning to shape the plant and promote air circulation are essential for healthy growth. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract scale insects or leaf spot, requiring prompt treatment.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne scleroptera is a tropical evergreen tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and beetles, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity by supporting a range of flora and fauna. Additionally, its dense canopy helps in reducing soil erosion by stabilizing the ground with its root system.</p>
<p>This plant also plays a role in maintaining the overall health and structure of tropical forests.</p>
