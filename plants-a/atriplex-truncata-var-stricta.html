<p>Atriplex truncata var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
