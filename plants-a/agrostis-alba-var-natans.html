                    <h1>Agrostis alba var. natans</h1>
<p>Agrostis alba var. natans, commonly known as floating bentgrass, is a grass species that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with leaves that often float on the water surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread efficiently in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to low-nutrient waters and is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.</p>
