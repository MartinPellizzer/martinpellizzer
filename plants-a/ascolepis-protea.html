<p>Ascolepis protea, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, silver-white bracts that enclose the actual flowers, which are small and clustered in a dense head. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in fynbos vegetation, adapting well to the region's Mediterranean climate with wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Ascolepis protea is not only ornamental but also plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
