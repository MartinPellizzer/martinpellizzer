                <h1>Aechmea alba</h1>
<p>Aechmea alba, commonly known as the white pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is typically bright green with white or silver variegation, adding to its ornamental appeal. Aechmea alba produces a tall flower spike that bears small, white, bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in succession.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea alba has leaves that are strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a waxy, silver-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a typical stem, instead having a short, compact rosette structure with dense, fibrous roots. Its flowers are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette, with white petals and a yellowish throat, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiky, greenish capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds.</p>
<p>These seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread in open, sunny habitats.</p>
