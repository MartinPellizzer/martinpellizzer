<p>Aechmea alba, commonly known as the white pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is typically bright green with white or silver variegation, adding to its ornamental appeal. Aechmea alba produces a tall flower spike that bears small, white, bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in succession.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
