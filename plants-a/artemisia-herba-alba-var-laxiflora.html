                    <h1>Artemisia herba-alba var. laxiflora</h1>
<p>Artemisia herba-alba var. laxiflora, commonly known as white mugwort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clustered panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or arid soils.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of natural pesticides.</p>
