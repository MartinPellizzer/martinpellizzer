                <h1>Adeloda integra</h1>
<p>Adeloda integra, commonly known as the smooth adeloda, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Adeloda integra is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeloda integra has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeloda integra is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in the Andes, it is now found in cultivation in various parts of the world, including Europe and North America. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. Adeloda integra typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a rare species and is listed as endangered in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adeloda integra is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to arid regions, known for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by stem cuttings, with the latter offering quicker results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization is minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning should be done in late winter to maintain shape and promote flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly moist conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials or cacti can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
