                <h1>Adeloda integra</h1>
<p>Adeloda integra, commonly known as the smooth adelopha, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Adeloda integra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeloda integra has simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow in a creeping or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeloda integra is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California, Nevada, and parts of Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as hillsides, cliffs, and desert margins. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often seen in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Adeloda integra is an important part of the local flora in these areas, contributing to the ecological balance of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeloda integra was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with dry to semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Utah, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. It has also been introduced to parts of Australia and New Zealand as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns in some regions due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecological settings.</p>
