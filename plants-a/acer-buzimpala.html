<p>Acer buzimpala, commonly known as the Buzimpala maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects.</p>
