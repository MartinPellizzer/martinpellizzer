                <h1>Achyrocline mathiolifolia</h1>
<p>Achyrocline mathiolifolia, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, pink to purple flowers. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline mathiolifolia has narrow, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline mathiolifolia is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This plant thrives in humid subtropical climates and is often found in forested areas. It is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest biome.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in southern Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline mathiolifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its adaptability to various soil types. The plant thrives in sunny environments and is often seen growing along beaches and dunes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions where it competes with native flora.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
