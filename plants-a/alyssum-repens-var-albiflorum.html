                    <h1>Alyssum repens var. albiflorum</h1>
<p>Alyssum repens var. albiflorum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period.</p>
