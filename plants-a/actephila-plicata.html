                <h1>Actephila plicata</h1>
<p>Actephila plicata, commonly known as the pleated actephila, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and leaves that are often folded or pleated, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Actephila plicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila plicata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, displaying a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody with a smooth, pale gray bark, and exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila plicata is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal and tropical regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and open woodlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the northern and eastern parts of Queensland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila plicata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
