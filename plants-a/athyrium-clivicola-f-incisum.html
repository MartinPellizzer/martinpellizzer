<p>Athyrium clivicola f. incisum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided, serrated leaflets that give it a lacy appearance. This fern is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded areas.</p>
