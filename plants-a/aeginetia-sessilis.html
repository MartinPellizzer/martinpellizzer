                <h1>Aeginetia sessilis</h1>
<p>Aeginetia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile aeginetia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia sessilis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is pale and hairy.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with some lateral branching. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
