<p>Agrostis hugoniana, commonly known as the Hugon's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine or arctic environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
