                <h1>Acokanthera friesiorum</h1>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, often branched stem and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids, particularly acokantherine, which makes it dangerous to handle.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of poison for hunting arrows.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences; they bloom during the dry season and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in a very limited area within the dense rainforests of the central part of the country. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to southern Africa, known for its medicinal properties and striking red flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal watering once established. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sage.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native flora. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of the region.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum is a plant known for its toxic properties and limited practical applications.</p>
<p>It is not used in culinary contexts due to its high toxicity. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some African cultures for ritualistic purposes, though its use is highly restricted. Industrially, it has limited economic value, but its toxicity has led to research into potential pharmaceutical applications.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often associated with power and danger.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum has several varieties and cultivars that are of interest in horticulture, though specific cultivars are not widely documented in common gardening sources.</p>
<p>Some hybrids have been developed to enhance its ornamental qualities, particularly its striking yellow flowers. While it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes, it holds horticultural importance in certain regions where it is grown for its unique appearance and ecological value. Its limited cultivation is mainly due to its toxicity and specific growing requirements.</p>
<p>Researchers and botanists continue to study its potential for both medicinal and ornamental use.</p>
