                <h1>Acokanthera friesiorum</h1>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used by indigenous peoples to poison the tips of arrows. Its latex is also highly toxic and can cause severe symptoms if ingested or contacted with the skin.</p>
<p>Despite its dangerous properties, the plant has some traditional medicinal uses in certain cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are yellowish-green, clustered in terminal umbels, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and penetrate deep into the soil, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry forests, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with savanna ecosystems. It is also present in parts of southern and eastern Africa, including Namibia and Botswana.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is typically found in remote areas and is not widely cultivated.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera friesiorum was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Africa, where it thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dense forests and along riverbanks, where it benefits from rich, moist soils. This plant has been introduced for its medicinal properties, as it contains toxic alkaloids used in traditional medicine. However, its introduction has also raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in some areas.</p>
<p>Overall, its distribution is closely linked to human activity and the availability of suitable habitats.</p>
