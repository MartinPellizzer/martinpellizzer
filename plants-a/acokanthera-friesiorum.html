<p>Acokanthera friesiorum, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used by indigenous peoples to poison the tips of arrows. Its latex is also highly toxic and can cause severe symptoms if ingested or contacted with the skin.</p>
