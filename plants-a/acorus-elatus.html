                <h1>Acorus elatus</h1>
<p>Acorus elatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sweetflag, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Acorus elatus thrives in moist, swampy soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus elatus has long, sword-shaped leaves that are narrow and tapering, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, spadix-like flowers that are yellow-green in color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The plant forms a single, three-lobed fruit that releases small, dark seeds through mechanical means when the fruit matures.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus elatus is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands, often introduced for ornamental purposes. This plant thrives in wetland environments, including marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acorus elatus is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its wild populations are sometimes threatened by habitat loss and urban development.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus elatus is a hardy aquatic plant known for its lush, sword-shaped leaves and ability to thrive in wet environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by planting rhizome fragments in shallow water or moist soil. The growth cycle of Acorus elatus is perennial, with new shoots emerging in spring and foliage dying back in winter, depending on climate conditions.</p>
<p>It prefers rich, loamy soil with good drainage and consistent moisture, requiring regular watering to maintain humidity. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in late fall helps maintain plant health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or snails, and it pairs well with water lilies and cattails in wetland gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus elatus is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as insects and birds due to its flowering structure and nectar. The plant acts as a natural filter, helping to improve water quality by absorbing pollutants. It also serves as a companion plant for other wetland species, promoting biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion in wetland areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus elatus is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its rhizomes are sometimes used as a flavoring agent, adding a subtle, spicy aroma to dishes. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used in herbal remedies to treat digestive issues and respiratory conditions due to its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, the plant's fibers have been utilized in the production of textiles and paper, contributing to local economies in certain regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, Acorus elatus holds symbolic significance in some Asian traditions, often associated with purification and spiritual cleansing.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus elatus has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Aureus' and 'Variegatus', which are known for their striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>While Acorus elatus is not commonly hybridized due to its limited genetic variability, some crosses with related species like Acorus calamus have been attempted in horticultural research. These cultivars are valued for their ability to thrive in wet conditions, making them ideal for water gardens and bog landscapes. Their aesthetic appeal and adaptability contribute significantly to their horticultural importance in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and ease of care, they are often used in pondside plantings and as decorative elements in moist environments.</p>
