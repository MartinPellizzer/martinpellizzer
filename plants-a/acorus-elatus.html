                <h1>Acorus elatus</h1>
<p>Acorus elatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-yellow in color. Acorus elatus thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>It is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus elatus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and rhizomatous, with a dark brown, rough-textured bark that grows horizontally underground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spadix, which are enclosed by a pale green spathe, and they bloom in early spring, pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains small seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomes that form a network underground, helping the plant to absorb nutrients and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus elatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Pacific islands. It prefers shady, moist conditions and is commonly found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Acorus elatus is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that plays an important role in wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus elatus was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments where it can thrive in shallow waters with muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>It is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. This plant is known for its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants.</p>
