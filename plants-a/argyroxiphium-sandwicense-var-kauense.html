<p>Argyroxiphium sandwicense var. kauense, commonly known as the Kauaʻi ʻōhana, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Kauaʻi in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within mesic to wet forest environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of Hawaii.</p>
