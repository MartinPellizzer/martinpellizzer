                <h1>Actephila bella</h1>
<p>Actephila bella, commonly known as the pretty leaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Actephila bella is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila bella has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and it grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on environmental conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila bella is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is commonly observed in the northern parts of Queensland.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with well-drained soils and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila bella was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it common in temperate and subtropical climates. This plant is often found in disturbed or secondary growth areas due to its adaptability to varying light conditions. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to produce numerous small, easily dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
