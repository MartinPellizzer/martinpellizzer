                <h1>Aconitum mogollonicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum mogollonicum, commonly known as the Mogollon monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green hue and a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum mogollonicum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer to early fall, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in rocky, alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum mogollonicum is primarily native to the Great Basin and surrounding regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. This species thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is particularly associated with the states of Nevada, Utah, and parts of Idaho.</p>
<p>Aconitum mogollonicum is an important component of the local flora in these arid and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum mogollonicum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the western states.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. The plant has been reported in states including Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated and spread beyond its native range.</p>
