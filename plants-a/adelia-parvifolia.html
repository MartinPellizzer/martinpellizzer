                <h1>Adelia parvifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved adelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, white to pale blue flowers. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia parvifolia has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by forming a dense root system near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia parvifolia is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically from New South Wales to the northern regions of Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal sand dunes and heathlands, thriving in well-drained soils. This plant is well adapted to the temperate to subtropical climate of its native range. It is often seen in areas with high saline content and is a characteristic species of the coastal flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of the eastern Australian coastline.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia parvifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The introduction occurred during the 19th century when European settlers were establishing gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>This distribution highlights the ecological impacts of introducing non-native species to new environments.</p>
