                    <h1>Adelia parvifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved adelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, white to pale blue flowers. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic gardens.</p>
