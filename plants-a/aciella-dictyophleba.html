                <h1>Aciella dictyophleba</h1>
<p>Aciella dictyophleba, commonly known as the clustered aciella, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has a compact, low-growing habit. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered together.</p>
<p>Aciella dictyophleba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciella dictyophleba has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella dictyophleba is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. It is adapted to the cold and harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella dictyophleba was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. The plant is often found in regions where human activity has altered the natural landscape. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several new geographic locations beyond its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>
