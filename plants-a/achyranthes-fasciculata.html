                <h1>Achyranthes fasciculata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its stems are often hairy and can exude a milky sap when damaged.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes fasciculata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in spikes, consisting of five sepals and two petals, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes fasciculata is primarily native to Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in various habitats across the country, including grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed areas. The plant thrives in regions with warm climates and moderate rainfall. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open fields.</p>
<p>Its native distribution in Tanzania highlights its adaptability to different environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes fasciculata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since spread throughout the country, particularly in regions with mild climates and well-drained soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have led to its classification as an environmental weed in some parts of New Zealand. Although it is not considered highly invasive, its presence can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts focus on controlling its spread in sensitive habitats to protect local biodiversity.</p>
