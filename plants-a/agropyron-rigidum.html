                    <h1>Agropyron rigidum</h1>
<p>Agropyron rigidum, commonly known as rigid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth and bluish-green foliage, which remains dense even in harsh winter conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters, with awns (bristle-like structures) that aid in seed dispersal. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Agropyron rigidum is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits.</p>
