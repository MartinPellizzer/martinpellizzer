                <h1>Acronychia papuana</h1>
<p>Acronychia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan acronychia, is a member of the Rutaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Indonesia and Papua.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, often with a waxy surface and a distinct midrib. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia papuana has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a waxy texture. The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia papuana is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this island, particularly in the lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly seen in the understory of rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern and western parts of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia papuana was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and lowland areas where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in parts of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and other Pacific island nations. Its introduction has been largely for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
