<p>Acronychia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan acronychia, is a member of the Rutaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Indonesia and Papua.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, often with a waxy surface and a distinct midrib. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
