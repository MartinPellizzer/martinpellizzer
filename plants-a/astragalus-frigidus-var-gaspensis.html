                    <h1>Astragalus frigidus var. gaspensis</h1>
<p>Astragalus frigidus var. gaspensis, commonly known as Gaspens flaxvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its potential for use in phytoremediation.</p>
