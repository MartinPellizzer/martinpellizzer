                <h1>Acnistus lorentzii</h1>
<p>Acnistus lorentzii, commonly known as the silverleaf acnistus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes grown in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus lorentzii has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and grows upright, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus lorentzii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing along forest edges, riverbanks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus lorentzii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wetland and riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant ecological threat.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and restore native vegetation in affected areas.</p>
