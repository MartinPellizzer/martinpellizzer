                <h1>Acourtia cuernavacana</h1>
<p>Acourtia cuernavacana, commonly known as the Cuernavaca dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is found in regions with a temperate climate. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acourtia cuernavacana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia cuernavacana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and covered with fine, soft hairs, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in arid or rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia cuernavacana is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in specific regions within these areas, particularly in the states of Hidalgo, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo León. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on limestone outcrops. The plant is adapted to the dry and semi-arid climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia cuernavacana was mainly introduced to the central and southern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Michoacán.</p>
<p>It thrives in semi-arid to arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along limestone outcrops. The plant is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and has become an important part of the local flora in these areas. Its introduction has contributed to the biodiversity of these ecosystems, although it is considered a non-native species in most of its current range.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in dry climates.</p>
