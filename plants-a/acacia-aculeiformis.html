                    <h1>Acacia aculeiformis</h1>
<p>Acacia aculeiformis, commonly known as the slender thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Acacia aculeiformis is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood.</p>
