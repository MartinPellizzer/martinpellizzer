                <h1>Acampe bidoupense</h1>
<p>Acampe bidoupense, commonly known as the Bidoup Mountain Acampe, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in primary forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and understudied species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acampe bidoupense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from September to November, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe bidoupense is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Vietnam, specifically found in the Bidoup-Nui Ba Na National Park.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within this protected area. It thrives in moist, shaded forest understories with high humidity and rich soil. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,200 and 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, Acampe bidoupense is considered critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acampe bidoupense is a unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acampe bidoupense includes a period of active growth during the rainy season, followed by a dormant phase during dry months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or flowering plants can enhance its growth and support local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acampe bidoupense is a native plant that provides essential food and shelter for local wildlife and contributes to the overall health of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and supporting plant reproduction. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Acampe bidoupense plays a vital role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in the area.</p>
