                    <h1>Agrostis gigantea var. repens</h1>
<p>Agrostis gigantea var. repens, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread aggressively, forming a thick turf.</p>
<p>Velvet fescue is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand moderate foot traffic.</p>
