                    <h1>Avena cespitosa f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Avena cespitosa f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous oat, is a variant of the common oat characterized by its unique reproductive feature.</p>
<p>This plant produces viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant, allowing for rapid propagation. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and forms dense, grass-like clumps. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets.</p>
<p>This form is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
