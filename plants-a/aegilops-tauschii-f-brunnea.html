                    <h1>Aegilops tauschii f. brunnea</h1>
<p>Aegilops tauschii f. brunnea, commonly known as the dark-hulled wild wheat, is a diploid wild relative of wheat native to the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark brown, glabrous lemma and palea, distinguishing it from other forms of Aegilops tauschii. This subspecies is notable for its genetic contribution to modern wheat breeding programs, particularly in enhancing disease resistance and stress tolerance. It typically grows in dry, open habitats and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important resource for genetic diversity in cereal crops.</p>
