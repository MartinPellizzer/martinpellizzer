                <h1>Adenophora biformifolia</h1>
<p>Adenophora biformifolia, commonly known as the two-lobed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Adenophora biformifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora biformifolia has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright and branching sparsely. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora biformifolia is primarily native to Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the area, where it thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments. It is often associated with open grasslands and shrublands, preferring well-drained soils. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Inner Mongolia, including cold winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to this region within China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora biformifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky slopes where it can thrive in cooler climates. This plant prefers moderate moisture levels and is often seen in regions with seasonal rainfall patterns. It is considered an ornamental species in some areas due to its attractive blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
