                    <h1>Artemisia molinieri</h1>
<p>Artemisia molinieri, commonly known as Molinier's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile compounds such as thujone and camphor. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Artemisia molinieri is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties.</p>
