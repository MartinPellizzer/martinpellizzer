                    <h1>Asplenium rhizophorum var. bipinnatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium rhizophorum var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a variant of the common rock fern.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its bipinnate fronds, which are finely divided and give it a delicate, lacy appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root-like structures, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens.</p>
