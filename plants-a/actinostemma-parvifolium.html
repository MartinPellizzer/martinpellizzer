                <h1>Actinostemma parvifolium</h1>
<p>Actinostemma parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved actinostemmatum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemma parvifolium has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma parvifolium is primarily native to North America, specifically the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the central and northeastern regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. It is often associated with the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>Its natural range includes parts of Ontario, Quebec, and several states in the eastern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma parvifolium was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered invasive in some areas. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
