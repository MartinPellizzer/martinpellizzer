                    <h1>Acacia ogadensis</h1>
<p>Acacia ogadensis, commonly known as the Somali acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia ogadensis is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitats.</p>
