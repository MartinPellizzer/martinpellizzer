                        <h1>Abies durangensis subsp. neodurangensis</h1>
<p>Abies durangensis subsp.</p>
<p>neodurangensis, commonly known as the Durango fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of the fir genus.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often found in cloud forests. Its cones are small and erect, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies durangensis subsp.</p>
<p>neodurangensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, specifically in the states of Durango and Zacatecas. This subspecies is found in high-altitude pine forests, typically at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and variable weather conditions of the Sierra Madre Occidental.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies durangensis subsp.</p>
<p>neodurangensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates characterized by high humidity and moderate temperatures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly adapted to high-altitude environments, where it forms dense forests. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of Mexico, particularly in the Sierra Madre mountains.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a valuable component of local biodiversity.</p>
