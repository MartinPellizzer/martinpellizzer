<p>Abies durangensis subsp.</p>
<p>neodurangensis, commonly known as the Durango fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of the fir genus.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often found in cloud forests. Its cones are small and erect, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
