                        <h1>Acacia gilbertii</h1>
<p>Acacia gilbertii, commonly known as Gilbert's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for dry climates.</p>
<p>Acacia gilbertii is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of nectar for native pollinators.</p>
