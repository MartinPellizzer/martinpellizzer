The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural spread.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Achillea × lewisii make it an adaptable and resilient species in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × lewisii has basal to loosely upright leaf arrangement with lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are hairy and can grow up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and often reddish-brown in color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to September and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with pappus hairs, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × lewisii is a hybrid plant native to the western United States, specifically found in parts of California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes areas where its parent species, Achillea millefolium and Achillea lanulosa, naturally occur. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea × lewisii is considered to be of low conservation concern due to its adaptability and widespread occurrence in its native range.</p>
