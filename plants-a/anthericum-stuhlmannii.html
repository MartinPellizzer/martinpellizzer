                    <h1>Anthericum stuhlmannii</h1>
<p>Anthericum stuhlmannii, commonly known as Stuhlmann's lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its underground bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Anthericum stuhlmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
