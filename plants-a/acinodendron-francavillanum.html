                <h1>Acinodendron francavillanum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron francavillanum, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hairy seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron francavillanum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters, and they bloom during the dry season; they are likely pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where the plant is typically found.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron francavillanum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the undergrowth of dense forest ecosystems. This species is commonly found in lowland and mountainous regions where the climate remains consistently warm and moist. Its natural habitat includes areas with rich organic soil and high biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and deforestation, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron francavillanum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in partial shade. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction is often associated with ornamental horticulture and reforestation efforts.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly.</p>
