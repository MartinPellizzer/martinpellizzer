<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema tjendana is primarily native to the island of Tjendana in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is adapted to the warm and wet climate typical of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema tjendana was mainly introduced to the island of Tjendana in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ecological restoration project aimed at rehabilitating degraded land. The plant was selected for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its potential to prevent soil erosion. However, it has since spread beyond its intended area, raising concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now considered invasive in certain parts of the island.</p>
