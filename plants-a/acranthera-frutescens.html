                <h1>Acranthera frutescens</h1>
<p>Acranthera frutescens, commonly known as the slender acranthera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous species that typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves.</p>
<p>Acranthera frutescens is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera frutescens has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are generally small, measuring about 1â€“2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, branching, and covered with fine hairs, and it has a pale green to brownish bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera frutescens is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly observed in the understorey of primary and secondary forest habitats. The species is known for its small, fragrant flowers and is often associated with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regionally significant plant within Borneo's diverse flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera frutescens was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates that provide well-drained soils and moderate to high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean-type climates, such as parts of southern California, Australia, and the western coast of the United States. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be seen growing along roadsides, in gardens, and in open grasslands. Its introduction has been associated with both intentional cultivation for ornamental purposes and accidental spread through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
