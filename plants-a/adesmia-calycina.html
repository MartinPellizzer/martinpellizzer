                <h1>Adesmia calycina</h1>
<p>Adesmia calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences. It produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red aril.</p>
<p>Adesmia calycina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia calycina has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia calycina is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly encountered in coastal areas and dry scrublands, thriving in well-drained soils. This plant is often seen growing in open habitats with full sun exposure. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing nectar for local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia calycina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade due to its attractive blue flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in native habitats. It is considered a potential weed because of its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
