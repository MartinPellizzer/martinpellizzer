                <h1>Actinoseris hatschbachii</h1>
<p>Actinoseris hatschbachii, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a robust, branching stem with narrow, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Actinoseris hatschbachii is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoseris hatschbachii has small, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows from the base of the plant. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris hatschbachii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as in parts of Baja California and Sonora. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with limestone and gypsum soils in desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that provide the necessary conditions for its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris hatschbachii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dune environments where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. This species is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and extreme temperatures, making it well-suited for its introduced habitat. It has become a common sight in disturbed coastal areas along the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
