<p>Artemisia borealis subsp.</p>
<p>wormskioldii, commonly known as the Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.</p>
