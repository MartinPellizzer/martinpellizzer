                    <h1>Arabis elgonensis</h1>
<p>Arabis elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
