                <h1>Adiantum triquetrum</h1>
<p>Adiantum triquetrum, commonly known as the fan-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the shape of a fan, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky soils or along stream banks. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive triangular shape at the base of each frond.</p>
<p>Adiantum triquetrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum triquetrum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a finely divided structure and a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stem, and they range in size from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bright green color that turns reddish in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, though they are not showy and are often overlooked.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing sorus, and the plant relies on wind for spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum triquetrum is primarily native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous soils. It is particularly widespread in regions with cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its delicate, fan-shaped fronds and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum triquetrum was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has established itself in various habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream margins. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through horticultural trade or accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
