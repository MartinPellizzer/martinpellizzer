                    <h1>Anoplophytum setaceum</h1>
<p>Anoplophytum setaceum, commonly known as the spiny cactus or desert cactus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, adding a brief burst of color to the desert landscape. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Anoplophytum setaceum is often used in traditional medicine and is popular as a decorative plant in dry climates.</p>
