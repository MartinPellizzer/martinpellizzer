<p>Athyrium gedeanum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread slowly through its habitat.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproduction.</p>
