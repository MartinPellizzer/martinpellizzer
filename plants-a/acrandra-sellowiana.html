                <h1>Acrandra sellowiana</h1>
<p>Acrandra sellowiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a fine, even texture. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its high-quality wood, it has been heavily harvested, leading to its classification as an endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrandra sellowiana has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in terminal panicles, and bloom from late winter to early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrandra sellowiana is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the coastal areas of the northeastern states, including Pernambuco, Paraíba, and Ceará. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. Acrandra sellowiana is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within the biome.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Atlantic Forest, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrandra sellowiana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic value. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its spread in new environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, its ecological impact raises concerns among conservationists.</p>
