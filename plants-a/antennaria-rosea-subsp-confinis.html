<p>Antennaria rosea subsp.</p>
<p>confinis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and open meadows, often forming extensive colonies in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold, nutrient-poor conditions typical of its ecological niche.</p>
