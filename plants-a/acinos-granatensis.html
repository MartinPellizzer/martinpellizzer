                <h1>Acinos granatensis</h1>
<p>Acinos granatensis, commonly known as the Granada thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant features a spiny stem and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Acinos granatensis is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos granatensis has leaves that are narrow, needle-like, and linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a compact, shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the dry, rocky habitats where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos granatensis is a rare alpine plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain and France.</p>
<p>It is currently found in very limited areas, primarily in the Pyrenean region, where it thrives in rocky and grassy slopes. The plant prefers cold, humid environments and is typically found at high altitudes, ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from climate change and land use, Acinos granatensis is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species and its fragile ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos granatensis is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its attractive pink or white flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acinos granatensis is typically perennial, with active growth in spring and summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be light in spring, and pruning is minimal, mainly to remove dead or damaged foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos granatensis is a low-growing perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in alpine ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acinos granatensis contributes to nutrient cycling in rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos granatensis is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in horticulture for its attractive yellow flowers, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping. While not widely used in culinary applications, it has been explored for its potential in herbal medicine due to its bioactive compounds. The plant also plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its cultural importance is reflected in its presence in local flora studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos granatensis has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albus' and 'Rubrum', which are noted for their striking white and deep red flowers, respectively. Hybrids of Acinos granatensis are often developed to enhance flower color, fragrance, and hardiness. These plants hold horticultural importance as they are used in gardens and floral arrangements for their beauty and resilience.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to biodiversity and the aesthetic value of cultivated landscapes.</p>
