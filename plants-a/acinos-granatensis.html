                <h1>Acinos granatensis</h1>
<p>Acinos granatensis, commonly known as the granate snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually basal and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Acinos granatensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens that specialize in alpine flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos granatensis has leaves that are narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, bark that is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the rocky and dry habitats where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos granatensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils at high altitudes. It is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, reflecting its adaptation to harsh, arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos granatensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions of Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often growing in open woodlands or along mountain slopes. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. Its introduction has been noted in several botanical gardens and conservation areas where it is cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become established in some non-native regions, though it is not considered invasive.</p>
