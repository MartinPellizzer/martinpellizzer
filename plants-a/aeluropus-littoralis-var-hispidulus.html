                    <h1>Aeluropus littoralis var. hispidulus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus littoralis var. hispidulus, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and wiry, hairy stems that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and estuaries, often forming stable vegetation communities.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic inundation makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecological succession.</p>
