<p>Angiopteris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the water's surface. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Angiopteris angustifolia is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
