<p>Androsace strigillosa var. spinulifera, commonly known as the hairy mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its spinulose (spiny) leaves, which give it its specific epithet *spinulifera*.</p>
