                    <h1>Adiantum pectinatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pectinatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its fronds are covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Adiantum pectinatum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
