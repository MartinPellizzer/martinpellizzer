                <h1>Adiantum pectinatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pectinatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its fronds are covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Adiantum pectinatum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pectinatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a bright green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow, with a graceful, arching growth pattern, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and wiry, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Adiantum pectinatum is a sterile plant, meaning it does not produce flowers or fruits, so these characteristics are not applicable.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pectinatum is primarily native to Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in humid, tropical, and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous areas. The plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to diverse but similar ecological conditions throughout South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pectinatum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and botanical collections.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This fern has become established in several states, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. Its presence has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact.</p>
