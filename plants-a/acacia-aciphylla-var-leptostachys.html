                        <h1>Acacia aciphylla var. leptostachys</h1>
<p>Acacia aciphylla var. leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stemmed wattle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It has adapted to survive in poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soils and prevent erosion.</p>
