                    <h1>Avena baumgartenii</h1>
<p>Avena baumgartenii, commonly known as the Baumann's oat, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a grass-like plant with slender, leafy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bract-like structures enclosing the seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
