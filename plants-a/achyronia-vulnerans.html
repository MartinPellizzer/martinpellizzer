                <h1>Achyronia vulnerans</h1>
<p>Achyronia vulnerans, commonly known as the bleeding heart plant, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish hue, and its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, pendulous flowers that resemble a heart with a red or purple tip. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia vulnerans has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a bushy growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the spring months, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia vulnerans is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. This plant is commonly found in dense rainforests and along riverbanks where it can access ample sunlight and moisture. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia vulnerans was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along utility lines. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
