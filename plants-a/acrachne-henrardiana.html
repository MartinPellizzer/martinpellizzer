                <h1>Acrachne henrardiana</h1>
<p>Acrachne henrardiana, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are erect and somewhat hairy.</p>
<p>Acrachne henrardiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrachne henrardiana has leaves that are simple, ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne henrardiana is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in forested areas and along the edges of shrublands. It is well adapted to the warm and humid conditions typical of these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is also sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne henrardiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic species. Despite its initial popularity, the plant has since become invasive, outcompeting native flora in certain regions. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists who are working to control its population.</p>
<p>However, it remains a subject of study for its ecological impact and potential for biological control.</p>
