                <h1>Achras guapeda</h1>
<p>Achras guapeda, commonly known as the Guapeda aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras guapeda has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in panicles, and they bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in poor, arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras guapeda is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils, often found in the understory of primary forests. This plant is commonly associated with dry to semi-deciduous forests and is well adapted to the warm, tropical climate. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras guapeda was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of the Caribbean, particularly in regions with sandy soils and a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Cuba, the Bahamas, and parts of the Lesser Antilles. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, dunes, and abandoned agricultural lands. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in these regions, where it often forms dense stands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
