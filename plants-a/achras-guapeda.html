                <h1>Achras guapeda</h1>
<p>Achras guapeda, commonly known as the guapeda tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, spreading canopy. The plant produces large, palm-like leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and foothill areas.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras guapeda has palmate leaves that are large, broad, and typically green, with a smooth texture and a lobed shape; the leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and columnar, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and typically yellow or greenish in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, fleshy drupe that contains one or more seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras guapeda is a plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is currently found in various parts of the Amazon Basin and other humid lowland areas. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments within dense tropical forests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, though specific data may vary.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras guapeda is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant native to South America, often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Achras guapeda is typically slow, with the plant reaching maturity over several years, producing fruit in its second or third year.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can promote healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage fruit production. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras guapeda is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in the ecosystem. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, especially in coastal or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering a habitat for insects and small mammals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras guapeda is a lesser-known plant that has limited culinary use, primarily in local traditions where its fruit is occasionally consumed.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications, with traditional uses suggesting it may have anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it is not widely utilized, but its fibers could potentially be used in textile production. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often associated with resilience and adaptation.</p>
<p>Despite its limited applications, further research could reveal more about its potential benefits.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras guapeda has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Variegata' and 'Lemon Glow', which are known for their striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>While there are limited naturally occurring hybrids of Achras guapeda, horticulturists have developed various cultivars through selective breeding to enhance traits such as color, growth habit, and disease resistance. These cultivars are widely used in landscaping and as statement plants due to their unique appearance and adaptability to different climates. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens and its potential for use in both tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>Overall, Achras guapeda remains a valuable addition to modern horticultural collections.</p>
