<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon viride has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and have a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are pendulous, yellowish-green with reddish veins, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon viride is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in warm climates around the world, including parts of the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. This plant thrives in humid environments, often growing in moist forests or along stream banks. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is under threat from deforestation and land-use changes, leading to a decline in its wild populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
