                    <h1>Anaphalis busua</h1>
<p>Anaphalis busua, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Anaphalis busua is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes.</p>
