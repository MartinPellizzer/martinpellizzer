                    <h1>Agrostis seminuda</h1>
<p>Agrostis seminuda, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. Its flowering structures consist of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Agrostis seminuda is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded or compacted soil conditions.</p>
