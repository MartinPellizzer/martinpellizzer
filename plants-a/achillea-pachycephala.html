                <h1>Achillea pachycephala</h1>
<p>Achillea pachycephala, commonly known as the thick-headed yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and dense, upright stems that support its feathery, finely divided leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions.</p>
<p>Its name references the mythological figure Achilles, who was said to have used yarrow in treating wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pachycephala has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to spoon-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish-brown in color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind after the seeds mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pachycephala is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also cultivated in other regions with similar climates, including parts of North America and Australia. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in grasslands, scrublands, and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of concern in some areas, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pachycephala is a hardy perennial plant known for its compact growth and silver-green foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity within two to three years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune back any dead or damaged foliage to maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pachycephala is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea pachycephala contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil structure.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pachycephala is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in horticulture, often cultivated for its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use, though some traditional practices may incorporate its parts into local dishes.
