                <h1>Achillea pachycephala</h1>
<p>Achillea pachycephala, commonly known as the woolly yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an attractive plant for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pachycephala has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a woolly texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pachycephala is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of the country, particularly in the western and central parts. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, and semi-arid environments. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to Iran, where it is a common sight in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pachycephala was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadsides, fields, and other disturbed areas where it thrives in full sun. This plant has become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
