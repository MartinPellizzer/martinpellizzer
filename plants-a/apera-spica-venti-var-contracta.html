                    <h1>Apera spica-venti var. contracta</h1>
<p>Apera spica-venti var. contracta, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often wind-dispersed. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
