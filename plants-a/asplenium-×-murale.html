                    <h1>Asplenium × murale</h1>
<p>Asplenium × murale, commonly known as the wall fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria.</p>
<p>It is a compact, evergreen fern characterized by its narrow, leathery, dark green fronds that often curl at the tips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices and walls, where it can thrive in limited space. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize small areas.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to urban settings.</p>
