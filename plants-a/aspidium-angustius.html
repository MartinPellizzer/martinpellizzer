                    <h1>Aspidium angustius</h1>
<p>Aspidium angustius, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright cluster. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium angustius is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, making it a common sight in temperate regions.</p>
