                    <h1>Abies concolor f. atroviolacea</h1>
<p>Abies concolor f. atroviolacea, commonly known as the black-barked white fir, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white fir species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which contrasts sharply with its silvery-blue needle foliage. The plant is native to the high elevations of the western United States, particularly in areas with cool, moist climates. Its cones are typically slender and elongated, with a distinctive shape that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of this form lies in its unique morphological features and its role in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
