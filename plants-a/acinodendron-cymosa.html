                <h1>Acinodendron cymosa</h1>
<p>Acinodendron cymosa, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pentagonal-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cymosa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cymosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in the understorey of tropical rainforests. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Indian subcontinent, including northeastern India and Bangladesh.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cymosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, sunny environments with moderate to high levels of sunlight. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly, making it a common weed in many regions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several countries across the Americas and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often found in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
