                <h1>Adenocarpus graecus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus graecus, commonly known as the Greek milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with tufted hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus graecus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus graecus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pale yellow to greenish petals, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus graecus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry habitats such as hillsides, cliffs, and wastelands. This plant thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and hot, dry summers. Its distribution extends across countries like Greece, Turkey, Italy, and Morocco.</p>
<p>It is often associated with limestone and calcareous substrates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus graecus was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in countries such as Greece, Turkey, and southern Italy. Although it is not native to these areas, it has been widely cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for a variety of climates in its introduced range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
