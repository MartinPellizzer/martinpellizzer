                    <h1>Alnus gigantea</h1>
<p>Alnus gigantea, commonly known as the giant alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Alnus gigantea plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
