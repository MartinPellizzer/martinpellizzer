                    <h1>Abies cilicica var. isaurica</h1>
<p>Abies cilicica var. isaurica, commonly known as the Isaurian fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Taurus Mountains in Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the Caucasian fir, characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
