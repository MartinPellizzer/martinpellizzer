<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific region due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopale cameronica was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in coastal regions and disturbed landscapes such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
