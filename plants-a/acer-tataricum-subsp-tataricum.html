                <h1>Acer tataricum subsp. tataricum</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>tataricum, commonly known as the Tatarian maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Siberia. It typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to nine shallow, pointed lobes, and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. It produces small, red-orange samaras that are dispersed by wind, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental value and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal color and structural beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>tataricum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed, with a broad ovate shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 12 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged, allowing for effective aerial dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>tataricum is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia, including regions such as Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey. Its current distribution extends into the northeastern United States and Canada, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, typically in moist, well-drained soils found in forest edges, stream banks, and open woodlands. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>While it is not currently listed as threatened, its natural habitat faces pressure from habitat loss and climate change, leading to a moderate conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>tataricum is a deciduous shrub known for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning in late winter or early spring helps maintain shape and promote flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>tataricum is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as an erosion control species due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil. It also serves as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>tataricum is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological significance. It is used in landscaping and horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>While not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed into syrup, though it is less valued than that of other maple species. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in cultural symbolism, often representing resilience and natural beauty in regional folklore and art.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>tataricum has several popular cultivars such as 'Flacca' and 'Red Prince', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth. It is also commonly used in hybridization to create ornamental maple varieties with enhanced traits.</p>
