                <h1>Adamia versicolor</h1>
<p>Adamia versicolor, commonly known as the variable wood-sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of veins, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, often with a red or purple spot at the base. The plant grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its ability to vary in color and form depending on environmental conditions, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Adamia versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamia versicolor has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, almost white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a pale brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow with four petals, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
