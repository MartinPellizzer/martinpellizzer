                            <h1>Aira Sicula</h1>
<p>Aira grass, scientifically known as Aira sicula, is a unique and resilient plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas where it withstands harsh conditions. This grass has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring. Despite its modest appearance, Aira sicula plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its adaptability and ecological value make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
