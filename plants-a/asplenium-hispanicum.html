<p>Asplenium hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a leathery texture and dark green, glossy leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium hispanicum is relatively low-maintenance and often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
