                <h1>Adiantum gratum</h1>
<p>Adiantum gratum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to temperate regions of Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the hair of a maiden, hence its common name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum gratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum gratum has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, and are typically light green in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in early summer. The fruit is a spore-bearing structure, and the plant disperses its spores through wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gratum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments like forests and rocky areas. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mountainous regions. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range includes a variety of habitats, from coastal areas to higher elevations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gratum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and gardens. This fern thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to various regions beyond its native habitat.</p>
