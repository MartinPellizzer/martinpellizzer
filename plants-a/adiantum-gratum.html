                    <h1>Adiantum gratum</h1>
<p>Adiantum gratum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to temperate regions of Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the hair of a maiden, hence its common name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum gratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.</p>
