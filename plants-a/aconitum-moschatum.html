                <h1>Aconitum moschatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum moschatum, commonly known as the Chinese aconite or monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in a spire-like cluster. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply cut and often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum moschatum has large, compound leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, upright, and hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, arranged in dense spikes, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies during the summer months. The plant produces follicles as its fruit type, containing small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum moschatum is primarily native to the West Himalaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of northern India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This plant typically grows at high elevations, often in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is adapted to the cold and humid conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>The species is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum moschatum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and botanical collections.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated landscapes, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant has been reported in several states, including Oregon, Washington, and California. Due to its ornamental value, it has spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
