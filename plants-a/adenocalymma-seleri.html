                <h1>Adenocalymma seleri</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma seleri, commonly known as the Seler's adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma seleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma seleri has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a white or pale pink color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma seleri is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and mountainous areas. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma seleri is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region's unique flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma seleri was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along creek banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
