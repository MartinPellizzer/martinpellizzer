                    <h1>Alsine parnassica</h1>
<p>Alsine parnassica, commonly known as Parnassian sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically features small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of soil.</p>
<p>Alsine parnassica plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
