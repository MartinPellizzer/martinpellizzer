                            <h1>Arctostaphylos Manzanita Subsp. Bakeri</h1>
<p>Arctostaphylos manzanita subsp. bakeri is a hardy shrub native to the western United States. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Known for its vibrant red berries and dense, evergreen foliage, this plant is both ecologically and aesthetically significant. Its resilience to drought and fire makes it an important species in ecosystem restoration efforts. Despite its hardiness, it remains a relatively understudied plant in botanical research.</p>
