                    <h1>Azorella lanceolata</h1>
<p>Azorella lanceolata, commonly known as the Andean rock cactus, is a unique plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its low, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, and its leaves are modified into spines to reduce water loss. Azorella lanceolata thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various small animals and insects.</p>
