                <h1>Achillea ketenoglui</h1>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui, commonly known as the Turkish yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often aromatic.</p>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish composite heads made up of many tiny florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spreading growth habit.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui is a flowering plant native to Turkey, specifically found in the Mediterranean region of the country.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, primarily in the southern and central parts of Turkey. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and open slopes, often growing in sunny environments with well-drained soil. This species is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, Achillea ketenoglui is considered a rare species and is currently listed as endangered in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and fluffy, yellow or white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune dead foliage in late winter to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew; companion planting with lavender or thyme can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, which contribute to the ecosystem's biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui also plays a role in improving soil health by contributing to nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily found in specific regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>While it does not have widespread culinary use, it may be locally utilized in traditional recipes or as a seasoning in certain rural communities. In terms of medicinal applications, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy. Industrially, it may contribute to biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats, supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions or folklore, though detailed records of its symbolic roles are limited.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Caucasica' and 'Lambina', known for their vibrant yellow to orange flower heads and compact growth habit. While there are fewer hybrids specifically developed for Achillea ketenoglui compared to other yarrow species, some horticultural crosses have been made to enhance color and resilience. These cultivars are widely appreciated in gardens for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea ketenoglui holds horticultural importance as a hardy, low-maintenance plant that adds visual interest to landscapes.</p>
