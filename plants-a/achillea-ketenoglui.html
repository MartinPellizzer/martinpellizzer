                <h1>Achillea ketenoglui</h1>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui, commonly known as the Ketenoglui yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late summer to early fall, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of the Caucasus and the Middle East, thriving in rocky and arid environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. It is found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achillea ketenoglui is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not yet classified as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy, yellow flower heads and drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, especially once established. Fertilization should be light in spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea ketenoglui contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea ketenoglui is a lesser-known plant that has limited documented uses compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may involve its use in local cuisines.
