                    <h1>Aspidium exaltatum var. longipinna</h1>
<p>Aspidium exaltatum var. longipinna, commonly known as the long-needle shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf shield fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with long, slender pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
