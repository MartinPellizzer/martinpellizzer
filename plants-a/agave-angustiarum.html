<p>Agave angustiarum, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a species of agave native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are typically followed by the development of blue-gray berries. Agave angustiarum is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber, while the plant itself is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
