                <h1>Aegilops heldreichii</h1>
<p>Aegilops heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Aegilops heldreichii is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops heldreichii has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-angled spike that releases small, black seeds through mechanical means when the spike dries and breaks.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
