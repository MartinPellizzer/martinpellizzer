<p>Asplenium sorzogonense, commonly known as the Sorongon spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its fronds are usually unbranched and produce sporangia on the underside, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium sorzogonense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
