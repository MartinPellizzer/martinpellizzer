<p>Agrostis involuta, commonly known as the bentgrass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-gray blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Agrostis involuta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its dense growth makes it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a valuable forage plant for livestock.</p>
