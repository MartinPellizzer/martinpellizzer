<p>Arundarbor atra, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous tree native to the wetlands and riparian zones of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
