<p>Aspidium telfairianum, commonly known as the Telfair's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, and the spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium telfairianum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
