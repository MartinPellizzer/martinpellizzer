                    <h1>Agrostis fertilis</h1>
<p>Agrostis fertilis, commonly known as the fertilis bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh.</p>
<p>Agrostis fertilis is valued for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
