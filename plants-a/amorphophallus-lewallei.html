                    <h1>Amorphophallus lewallei</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus lewallei, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of water. The plant produces a strikingly large, white flower that blooms at night, emitting a strong odor reminiscent of rotting flesh to attract pollinators. Its underground tuberous structure allows it to store nutrients and survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms.</p>
