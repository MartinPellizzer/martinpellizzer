<p>Aegilops ligustica, commonly known as the Italian goatgrass, is a wild cereal grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Aegilops ligustica has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve wheat varieties due to its genetic diversity.</p>
