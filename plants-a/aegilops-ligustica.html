                <h1>Aegilops ligustica</h1>
<p>Aegilops ligustica, commonly known as the Italian goatgrass, is a wild cereal grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Aegilops ligustica has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve wheat varieties due to its genetic diversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops ligustica has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in dry, rocky soils.</p>
