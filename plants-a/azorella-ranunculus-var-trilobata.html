                    <h1>Azorella ranunculus var. trilobata</h1>
<p>Azorella ranunculus var. trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed buttercup, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with three distinct lobes, which bloom in early spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to the cold, high-altitude environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
