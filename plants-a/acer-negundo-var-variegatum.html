                <h1>Acer negundo var. variegatum</h1>
<p>Acer negundo var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated ash, is a variant of the green ash tree characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broader and more lobed than those of the typical green ash, with a striking combination of green, white, and yellow colors. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist soils along rivers and streams. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. variegatum has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes variegated underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 5–10 cm long and arranged along the stem. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. variegatum is a variant of the box elder tree, originally native to parts of eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>While it is not widely distributed in the wild, it is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks across temperate regions worldwide. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, wetlands, and along stream banks. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its wild populations are rare, and it is primarily maintained through human cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. variegatum is a unique variant of the boxelder tree known for its variegated leaves and adaptability to various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining variegation. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5–10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its ornamental value and attract beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. variegatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>
