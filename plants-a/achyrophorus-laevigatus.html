                <h1>Achyrophorus laevigatus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth achyrophorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its smooth, glabrous stems and foliage contribute to its distinctive botanical appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus laevigatus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus laevigatus is primarily native to the southern United States, including Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and sandy soils. This plant thrives in regions with low rainfall and high sun exposure. It is often associated with disturbed areas and can be found along roadsides and in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus laevigatus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in states like Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and anthropogenic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
