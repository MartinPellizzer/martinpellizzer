<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>monticola, commonly known as the mountain dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish stems and tiny, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>This species typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as grasses and forbs, forming a hemiparasitic relationship. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its environment.</p>
