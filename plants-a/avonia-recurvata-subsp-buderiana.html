<p>Avonia recurvata subsp.</p>
<p>buderiana, commonly known as the Buder's avonia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Native to specific regions of Europe, this subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying rare flora and ecological adaptations.</p>
