                    <h1>Asplenium yuanum</h1>
<p>Asplenium yuanum, commonly known as the Yunnan holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, clustered in small, round groups.</p>
<p>Asplenium yuanum is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
