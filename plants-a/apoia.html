<p>Apoia, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, flexible fronds that can climb and wrap around supports, allowing it to grow vertically. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor and spread in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically divided into small, delicate segments with a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Apoia thrives in humid climates and is often found in rainforests or along streams where there is consistent moisture.</p>
