<p>Arenaria globuliflora, commonly known as the globular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the western United States.</p>
<p>It produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. The plant has compact, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria globuliflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
