                <h1>Adyseton obcordatum</h1>
<p>Adyseton obcordatum, commonly known as the obcordate bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adyseton obcordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton obcordatum has alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
