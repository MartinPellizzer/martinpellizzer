                    <h1>Avicennia floridana</h1>
<p>Avicennia floridana, commonly known as the Florida mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal regions, particularly in estuaries and tidal marshes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has specialized roots that filter out salt, allowing it to survive in brackish water. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces woody fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>Avicennia floridana is an essential component of mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
