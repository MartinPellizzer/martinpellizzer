                    <h1>Aira cespitosa var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Aira cespitosa var. littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense clumps of narrow, bluish-gray leaves. The plant produces spikelets with small, wind-dispersed seeds, adapted to thrive in saline and sandy environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate saltwater and extreme weather makes it a resilient coastal vegetation species.</p>
