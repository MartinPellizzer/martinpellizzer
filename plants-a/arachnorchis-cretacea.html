<p>Arachnorchis cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous orchid, is a rare and ancient orchid species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its genus name "Arachnorchis.". The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
