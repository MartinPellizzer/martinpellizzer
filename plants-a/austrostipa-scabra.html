<p>Austrostipa scabra, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray.</p>
<p>Austrostipa scabra plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>
