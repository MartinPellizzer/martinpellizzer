                <h1>Achillea kamelinii</h1>
<p>Achillea kamelinii, commonly known as Kamelin's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its slender stems and feathery leaves are complemented by small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Achillea kamelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea kamelinii has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray upper surface and a darker underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a grayish-brown color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's survival in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea kamelinii is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Caucasus and the western Himalayas, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. This plant is typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as slopes, meadows, and rocky outcrops at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Achillea kamelinii is considered to be of conservation concern, with its population remaining relatively stable but vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea kamelinii is a compact, herbaceous perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing mature clumps in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea kamelinii involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like thyme or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea kamelinii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea kamelinii contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>
