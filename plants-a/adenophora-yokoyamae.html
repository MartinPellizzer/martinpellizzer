<p>Adenophora yokoyamae, commonly known as the Yokoyama's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora yokoyamae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora yokoyamae has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a pale green color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern.

<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This species thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its natural range is limited to these specific regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in Japan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora yokoyamae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes. This plant is often found in regions with moderate temperatures and sufficient sunlight. Its distribution has been expanded through human activities, including horticultural interest and landscape gardening.</p>
