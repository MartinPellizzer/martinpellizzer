                <h1>Aciphylla simplex</h1>
<p>Aciphylla simplex, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in coastal and alpine environments, tolerating harsh conditions such as strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Aciphylla simplex plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla simplex has needle-like leaves that are spiny, arranged in a rosette pattern, and measure up to 5 cm in length, with a grayish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, gray bark that grows upright from the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in a terminal inflorescence, blooming in spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in arid, rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla simplex is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of the South Island. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in open habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Aciphylla simplex plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic species of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla simplex was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the South Island. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats. It is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
