<p>Anisotes dumosus subsp.</p>
<p>galanae, commonly known as the Galana sandmat, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss and maximize photosynthesis in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
