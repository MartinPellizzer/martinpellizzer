                <h1>Aegiphila vitelliniflora</h1>
<p>Aegiphila vitelliniflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered aegiphila, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, often with a creeping habit.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience to drought and its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila vitelliniflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
