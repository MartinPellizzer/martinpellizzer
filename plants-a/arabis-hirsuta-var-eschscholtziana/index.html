                            <h1>Arabis Hirsuta Var. Eschscholtziana</h1>
<p>Arabis hirsuta var. eschscholtziana is a charming member of the Brassicaceae family known for its delicate, hairy foliage and clusters of small white flowers. Native to the coastal regions of California, this plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and full sun. It is often found in disturbed areas and along the edges of dunes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing the soil. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Despite its modest size, this plant is a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects.</p>
