                    <h1>Anthacanthus microphyllus var. serpyllifolius</h1>
<p>Anthacanthus microphyllus var. serpyllifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
