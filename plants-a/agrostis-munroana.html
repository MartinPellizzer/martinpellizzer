<p>Agrostis munroana, commonly known as Munro's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,丛生 (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Agrostis munroana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
