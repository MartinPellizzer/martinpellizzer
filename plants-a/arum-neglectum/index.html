                            <h1>Arum Neglectum</h1>
<p>Common arum, scientifically known as Arum neglectum, is a strikingly unusual plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This species is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, often colorful spathe that resembles a flower. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also known for its toxic properties, containing calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed or wetland areas. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of both fascination and caution among botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
