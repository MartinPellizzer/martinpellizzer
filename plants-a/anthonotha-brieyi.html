                    <h1>Anthonotha brieyi</h1>
<p>Anthonotha brieyi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low, sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Anthonotha brieyi is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability.</p>
