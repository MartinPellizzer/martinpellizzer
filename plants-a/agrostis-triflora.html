<p>Agrostis triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, creeping stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of three spikelets, giving it the common name, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Agrostis triflora is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
