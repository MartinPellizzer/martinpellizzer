                <h1>Achillea anglica</h1>
<p>Achillea anglica, commonly known as common yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and erect, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and flat, composite flower heads composed of small white or pinkish disc flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea anglica is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea anglica has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and have a rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern close to the ground.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark, growing from the base to a height of about 60 cm. The flowers are yellow, forming flat-topped clusters called cymes, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea anglica is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in the British Isles and parts of western and central Europe.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to North America, where it has been introduced and is often found in disturbed areas. This plant thrives in a variety of environments, including meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, and is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered a common species with a conservation status of least concern due to its adaptability and widespread presence.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea anglica is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly used in gardens for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, which germinate readily under mild conditions. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates, producing flowers in its second year.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea anglica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in preventing soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea anglica also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter accumulation.</p>
