<p>Agropyron agroelymoides, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and bluish-green color, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Agropyron agroelymoides is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
