                    <h1>Ammannia calcicola</h1>
<p>Ammannia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone ammannia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils, particularly those rich in calcium carbonate. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Ammannia calcicola is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
