                <h1>Adinandra angustifolia</h1>
<p>Adinandra angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Adinandra angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra angustifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are narrow and elongated, typically measuring 2–5 cm in length and 0.5–1 cm in width, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and they grow upright with a shrub-like habit. The small, fragrant flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra angustifolia is primarily native to Hainan.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the island. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas within lowland forests. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and rich soil of Hainan.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra angustifolia was mainly introduced to urban and agricultural areas in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found growing along roadsides, in disturbed soils, and near human settlements. The plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is largely attributed to accidental dispersal through human activities such as land clearing and construction.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and use in traditional medicine.</p>
