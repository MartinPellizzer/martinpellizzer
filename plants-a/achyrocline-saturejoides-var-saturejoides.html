<p>Achyrocline saturejoides var. saturejoides, commonly known as the scarlet false geranium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable to local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline saturejoides var. saturejoides has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact shrub form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline saturejoides var. saturejoides is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution remains largely restricted to these regions, though it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in coastal dunes or dry, sandy soils. This species typically occurs at low altitudes, usually below 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable, though its conservation status is not yet fully assessed.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrocline saturejoides var. saturejoides is a compact, aromatic shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, known for its ornamental value and use in aromatherapy.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years, and thrives in well-draining soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and encourage branching is recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests and enhance its aromatic properties.</p>
