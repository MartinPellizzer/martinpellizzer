<p>Aa chiogena, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark red to black heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. The tree has a straight trunk with a smooth, often fissured bark, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation, it is now classified as an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aa chiogena has simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>Its stems are upright, woody, and have a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, blooming in spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread widely underground, helping to stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aa chiogena is a rare and endangered plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in specific microhabitats on Socotra, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations due to habitat loss and overgrazing. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing in rocky crevices and limestone formations. Aa chiogena is usually found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from human activity, it is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.</p>
