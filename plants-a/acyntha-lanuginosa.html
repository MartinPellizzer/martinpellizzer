                <h1>Acyntha lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Acyntha lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy acynthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant has a compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive appearance.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha lanuginosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2-5 cm in length, with a pale green color and a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and covered in fine, soft hairs, with a light greenish hue and a sprawling growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha lanuginosa is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Tunisia. This plant thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is commonly found in scrublands and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, showing resilience to drought and poor soil quality.</p>
<p>Acyntha lanuginosa is often considered a characteristic species of the Mediterranean biome.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha lanuginosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, woolly appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native habitats. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed areas and competes with indigenous species for resources.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
