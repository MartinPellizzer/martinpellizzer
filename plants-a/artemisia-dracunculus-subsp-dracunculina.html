<p>Artemisia dracunculus subsp.</p>
<p>dracunculina, commonly known as giant tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and tall, branched flowering stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dry fruits called achene, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in monoterpenes, contribute to its distinctive licorice-like aroma and medicinal properties.</p>
