                <h1>Acmella darwinii</h1>
<p>Acmella darwinii, commonly known as the Darwin's button.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a compact, bushy growth habit with bright yellow flowers that resemble small buttons. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella darwinii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are bright yellow, with a distinctive central disk and showy petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella darwinii is primarily native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the unique ecosystems of this archipelago, which is located in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It thrives in the volcanic soils and coastal areas of the islands. The species is adapted to the specific climate and environmental conditions of the Galápagos.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the local biodiversity and is part of the flora that contributes to the ecological balance of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella darwinii was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a weed in several regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize open spaces quickly. Its rapid growth and ability to produce numerous seeds contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Management strategies include mechanical removal and the use of herbicides to control its spread.</p>
