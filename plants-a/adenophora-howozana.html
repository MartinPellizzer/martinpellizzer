                <h1>Adenophora howozana</h1>
<p>Adenophora howozana, commonly known as the Korean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Adenophora howozana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora howozana has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a pale pink base, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora howozana is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and rocky areas within these regions. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forested or semi-shaded environments. It is known for its attractive blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Adenophora howozana is a valuable addition to native plant gardens due to its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora howozana was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan, where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant's introduction has been associated with horticultural trade and intentional planting by gardeners and botanists. Due to its adaptability, it has occasionally escaped cultivation and established itself in natural habitats.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains limited compared to other invasive species.</p>
