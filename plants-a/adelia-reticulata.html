                <h1>Adelia reticulata</h1>
<p>Adelia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined adelia, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a distinctive net-like venation pattern.</p>
<p>Adelia reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia reticulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that contrasts with its lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length and 3-5 cm in width. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, featuring five petals and a prominent yellow stamen, and bloom in late spring, relying on insect pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, spherical berry that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia reticulata is primarily native to the eastern coast of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is commonly found in coastal forests and secondary growth areas. This plant is also present in parts of southern Arabia, particularly in the southern regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Adelia reticulata is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia reticulata was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands through human activity, particularly during colonization and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>It has since established populations in coastal areas and disturbed soils, often outcompeting native flora. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions have contributed to its widespread distribution. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
