                <h1>Adenostemma parviflorum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Adenostemma parviflorum is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in semi-arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma parviflorum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dull green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is erect, hairy, and has a rough texture, with a reddish-brown color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma parviflorum is primarily native to Borneo, Caroline Is., China Southeast, East Himalaya, Gilbert Is., Hainan, Hawaii, Jawa, Malaya, Marianas, Marquesas, Marshall Is., Nepal, New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Society Is., Sri Lanka, Sumatera, Taiwan, Thailand, Tokelau-Manihiki, Tonga, Tuvalu, and West Himalaya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. The plant typically grows in open grasslands, disturbed soils, and along coastal areas. It is well adapted to a variety of environmental conditions within its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans multiple islands and mainland regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma parviflorum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive small white flowers and drought tolerance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can dominate grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local biodiversity.</p>
