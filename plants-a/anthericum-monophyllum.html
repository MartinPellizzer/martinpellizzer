<p>Anthericum monophyllum, commonly known as the single-leaf lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a tall, slender stem topped with a single, showy white or pale pink flower that resembles a lily.
