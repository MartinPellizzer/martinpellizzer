                <h1>Adinandra glabra</h1>
<p>Adinandra glabra, commonly known as the smooth adinandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra glabra has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, with four petals and a superior ovary, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra glabra is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often in secondary growth or along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid tropical climates and is typically associated with shaded understorey vegetation. It is also known to occur in parts of India and on some nearby islands.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra glabra was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. This plant has been introduced to several Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia, as an ornamental species. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it has become invasive in some regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
