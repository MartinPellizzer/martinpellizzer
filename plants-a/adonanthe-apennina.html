                <h1>Adonanthe apennina</h1>
<p>Adonanthe apennina, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adonanthe apennina is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe apennina has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 3 to 8 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and typically have a pale yellow to white color, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe apennina is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas, cliffs, and dry, sunny habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with maritime climates. It is particularly prevalent in countries such as Italy, Greece, and Spain.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its adaptation to harsh, arid environments along the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe apennina was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the Mediterranean Basin, southern Europe, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This plant is often cultivated for its attractive, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Its introduction has been driven by its ornamental value and adaptability to garden environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated.</p>
