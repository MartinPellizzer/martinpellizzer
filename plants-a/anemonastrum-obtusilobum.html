                    <h1>Anemonastrum obtusilobum</h1>
<p>Anemonastrum obtusilobum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a fibrous root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by oval, spiny seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum obtusilobum is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems.</p>
