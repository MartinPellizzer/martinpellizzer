                        <h1>Acanthostachys strobilacea</h1>
<p>Acanthostachys strobilacea, commonly known as the woolly spike grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory.</p>
<p>Acanthostachys strobilacea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
