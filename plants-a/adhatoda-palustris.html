                <h1>Adhatoda palustris</h1>
<p>Adhatoda palustris, commonly known as marsh adhatoda, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, fertile soils. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential respiratory and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
<p>Adhatoda palustris is also valued in traditional medicine for its use in treating coughs and bronchial ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda palustris has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, typically in shades of blue or purple, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor itself in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda palustris is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is commonly found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. The plant is also present in some regions of Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical zones. It is adapted to humid climates and often grows in areas with standing water or high moisture levels.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its preference for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda palustris was mainly introduced to wetland and marshy areas where it thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia, including regions like India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. This plant is often used in traditional medicine for its respiratory and antipyretic properties. Its introduction has been both intentional and accidental, with some populations established through seed dispersal by water or animals.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited to specific ecological niches and does not pose a significant threat to native flora.</p>
