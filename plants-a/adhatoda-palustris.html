<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda palustris has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with a pale blue or violet color, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist soils, often found in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda palustris is a perennial herb native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.</p>
