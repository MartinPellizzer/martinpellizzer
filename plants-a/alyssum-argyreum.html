                    <h1>Alyssum argyreum</h1>
<p>Alyssum argyreum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Alyssum argyreum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings.</p>
