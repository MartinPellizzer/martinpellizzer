<p>Achillea haussknechtii, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is also noted, though its primary botanical significance lies in its ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
