                    <h1>Aechmea aquilega var. aquilega</h1>
<p>Aechmea aquilega var. aquilega, commonly known as the velvet plant or velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of broad, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful inflorescences, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
