                        <h1>Acaena acrobyssina</h1>
<p>Acaena acrobyssina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, spherical fruits. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by persistent, bristly burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Acaena acrobyssina thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest margins and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in New Zealand's native flora.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena acrobyssina is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountains and alpine regions. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as tussock grasslands.</p>
<p>Acaena acrobyssina is an important component of the native flora in these environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena acrobyssina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in coastal areas, river margins, and open forests. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly and compete with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread across the North and South Islands.</p>
