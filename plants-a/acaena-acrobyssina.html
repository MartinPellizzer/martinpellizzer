<p>Acaena acrobyssina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, spherical fruits. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by persistent, bristly burrs that aid in seed dispersal.
