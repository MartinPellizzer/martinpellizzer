<p>Angraecoides obversifolia, commonly known as the upward-leaved orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its unique upward-facing leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range.</p>
