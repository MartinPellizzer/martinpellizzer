                    <h1>Astragalus subulifer</h1>
<p>Astragalus subulifer, commonly known as the needleleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus subulifer is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
