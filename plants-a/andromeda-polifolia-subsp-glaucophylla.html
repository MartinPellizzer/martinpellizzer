<p>Andromeda polifolia subsp.</p>
<p>glaucophylla, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and dunes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
