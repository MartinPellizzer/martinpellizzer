                    <h1>Actinea heterophylla f. bicolor</h1>
<p>Actinea heterophylla f. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored actinea, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its striking color variation.</p>
<p>It features leaves (fronds) that exhibit a bi-colored pattern, typically with a dark green base and a lighter green or sometimes reddish margin. This variation is due to differences in chlorophyll distribution within the fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
