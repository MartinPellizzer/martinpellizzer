                <h1>Adinandra hirta var. hirta</h1>
<p>Adinandra hirta var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy adinandra, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has hairy, often reddish stems. The leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture with a serrated margin. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta var. hirta has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age, and grows upright with a bushy habit. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, with four petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta var. hirta is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to the lowland and hill forests of these regions, though it is becoming increasingly rare due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typically growing in the understorey of dense tropical forests. This species is usually found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to deforestation and habitat degradation, Adinandra hirta var. hirta is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta var. hirta is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2-3 years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta var. hirta is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring flora by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by offering ecological benefits to the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
