                    <h1>Arabidopsis bactriana</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis bactriana, commonly known as the Bactrian Arabidopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Central Asia, particularly regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. This plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic simplicity and short life cycle, it is sometimes used in botanical studies for understanding plant responses to environmental stress.</p>
