                    <h1>Ardisia pachysandra</h1>
<p>Ardisia pachysandra, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, carpet-like formation. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for ground cover.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
