                        <h1>Acantholimon modestum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon modestum, commonly known as the modest spinyweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and western China.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces delicate, blue to violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features reflect its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acantholimon modestum is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic plant of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
