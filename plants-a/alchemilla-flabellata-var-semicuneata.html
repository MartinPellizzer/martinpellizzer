                    <h1>Alchemilla flabellata var. semicuneata</h1>
<p>Alchemilla flabellata var. semicuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps to retain moisture and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
