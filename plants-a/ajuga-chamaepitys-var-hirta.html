<p>Ajuga chamaepitys var. hirta, commonly known as woolly ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are softly hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick carpets, making it a valuable ground cover in ecological restoration projects.</p>
