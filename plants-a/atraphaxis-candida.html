<p>Atraphaxis candida, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis candida is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid landscapes.</p>
