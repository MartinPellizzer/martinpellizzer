<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed bracts that give it a unique appearance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acalypha stokesii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha stokesii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
