<p>Alopecurus salditanus, commonly known as the Salditans sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet environments and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions.</p>
