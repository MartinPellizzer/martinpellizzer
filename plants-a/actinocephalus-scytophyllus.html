<p>Actinocephalus scytophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that grows on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive silver-gray upper surface and a darker, often reddish underside. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is characterized by its intricate, branching structure and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat.</p>
