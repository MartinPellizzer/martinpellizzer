                <h1>Actinocephalus scytophyllus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus scytophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that grows on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive silver-gray upper surface and a darker, often reddish underside. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is characterized by its intricate, branching structure and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus scytophyllus has leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branching, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus scytophyllus is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in the Northern California Coast Ranges. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Oregon and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus scytophyllus was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or loamy soils, often in open or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is commonly found in coastal dunes or disturbed soils. This plant is typically associated with coastal and inland sandplain habitats, where it can tolerate salt spray and wind exposure. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions, primarily in Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
