<p>Arrhostoxylum violaceum, commonly known as the purple-flowered cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, paddle-shaped cladodes that store water, typical of desert-adapted cacti. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
