                    <h1>Androsace septentrionalis var. typica</h1>
<p>Androsace septentrionalis var. typica, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of closely packed, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a raceme and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and compact growth form are adaptations to the extreme conditions of its native range.</p>
