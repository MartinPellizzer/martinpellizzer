<p>Antennaria groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny yellow flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its morphology includes a prostrate growth habit, which helps it conserve heat and avoid wind damage.</p>
<p>Antennaria groenlandica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and supports local pollinators.</p>
