                <h1>Adhatoda hyssopifolia</h1>
<p>Adhatoda hyssopifolia, commonly known as Indian skullcap, is a shrub native to tropical and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda hyssopifolia has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is square in cross-section, with a rough, dark brown bark that is slightly hairy, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are tubular with two lips, typically purple or violet in color, and bloom from April to July; they are pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, contributing to its stability in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda hyssopifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moist, warm climates and is often associated with forested or shrubland habitats. This plant is particularly prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, where it grows in both wild and cultivated settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen along riverbanks or in humid environments.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced and naturalized.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda hyssopifolia was mainly introduced to regions where it has become an invasive species, particularly in parts of the southern United States and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It spreads rapidly through seeds and vegetative growth, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and riverbanks, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its introduction is largely attributed to human activities, including the movement of soil and plants for agricultural or ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a significant threat to biodiversity and land management efforts in these regions.</p>
