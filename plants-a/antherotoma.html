<p>Antherotoma, commonly known as the "spear lichen," is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose or foliose, and its distinct, often colorful apothecia. The antheridia and paraphyses are well-developed, and the ascospores are usually ellipsoidal. Antherotoma species are often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>They play a role in nutrient cycling and are indicators of environmental conditions.</p>
