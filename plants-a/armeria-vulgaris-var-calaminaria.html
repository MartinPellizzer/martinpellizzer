                    <h1>Armeria vulgaris var. calaminaria</h1>
<p>Armeria vulgaris var. calaminaria, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and is commonly used in rock gardens and as a border plant.</p>
