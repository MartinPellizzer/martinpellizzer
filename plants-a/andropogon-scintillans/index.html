                            <h1>Andropogon Scintillans</h1>
<p>Andropogon scintillans is a striking grass species known for its vibrant, fiery red plumes that catch the eye in the late summer and fall. Native to the southeastern United States, this plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Its unique appearance has made it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects. The plant's common name, "sparkling grass," refers to the way its flowers shimmer in the wind. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively overlooked in mainstream horticulture compared to more widely cultivated grasses.</p>
