                        <h1>Acacia leucothrix</h1>
<p>Acacia leucothrix, commonly known as the white-stemmed wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, greyish stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acacia leucothrix is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia leucothrix is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and grassland habitats. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Acacia leucothrix plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various local wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia leucothrix was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both drought and frost, contributing to its spread.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its growth to protect local ecosystems.</p>
