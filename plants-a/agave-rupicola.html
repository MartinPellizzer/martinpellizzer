                    <h1>Agave rupicola</h1>
<p>Agave rupicola, commonly known as the rock agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are lined with sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Agave rupicola is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
