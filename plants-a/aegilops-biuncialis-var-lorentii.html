                    <h1>Aegilops biuncialis var. lorentii</h1>
<p>Aegilops biuncialis var. lorentii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing颖果 (glumes) and florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
