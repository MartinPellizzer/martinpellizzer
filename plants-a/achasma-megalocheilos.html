<p>Achasma megalocheilos, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its harsh, arid environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Achasma megalocheilos is considered an endangered species.</p>
