<p>Angraecopsis tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed orchid, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, strikingly shaped flowers with three prominent teeth-like projections. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms during the dry season, which is unusual for many orchids.</p>
<p>Angraecopsis tridens is also noted for its fragrant scent, which attracts specific pollinators like moths.</p>
