<p>Andropogon tomentellus, commonly known as silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the fine, silky hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grasslands and prairies.</p>
<p>Andropogon tomentellus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
