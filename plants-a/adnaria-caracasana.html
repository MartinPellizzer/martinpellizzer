                <h1>Adnaria caracasana</h1>
<p>Adnaria caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine, soft pubescence.</p>
<p>Adnaria caracasana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria caracasana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a slight resin when damaged. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with five petals, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria caracasana is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly in parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its distribution is also noted in some regions of Central America.</p>
<p>Adnaria caracasana is commonly associated with dry forest and savanna habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria caracasana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed areas like roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes competing with native species.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a concern in some areas where it invades local ecosystems.</p>
