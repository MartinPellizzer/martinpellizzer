<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon somalense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are pendulous, with a structure consisting of five lobes, and are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
