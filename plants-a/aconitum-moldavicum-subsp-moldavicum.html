                <h1>Aconitum moldavicum subsp. moldavicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum moldavicum subsp.</p>
<p>moldavicum, commonly known as Moldavian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to violet flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and stream sides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately compound with deeply lobed segments, and the roots contain toxic alkaloids.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum moldavicum subsp.</p>
<p>moldavicum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring up to 20 cm in diameter. The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures.</p>
<p>The flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and are pollinated by insects, blooming from July to August. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum moldavicum subsp.</p>
<p>moldavicum is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central and Eastern Europe. Its current distribution includes parts of Romania, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in forests, along stream banks, and in meadows, preferring well-drained soils. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum moldavicum subsp.</p>
<p>moldavicum is a striking perennial plant known for its tall spires of blue-violet flowers. It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and pruning dead foliage after flowering helps maintain its appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it benefits from companion planting with grasses or shrubs for support.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum moldavicum subsp.</p>
