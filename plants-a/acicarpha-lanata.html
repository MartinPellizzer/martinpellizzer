                <h1>Acicarpha lanata</h1>
<p>Acicarpha lanata, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grayish-green foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with a fibrous, hairy texture, which contributes to its common name. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits.</p>
<p>Acicarpha lanata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acicarpha lanata has leaves that are narrow and pointed, with a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a greenish-brown color, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in terminal panicles, with pale yellow petals and a tubular shape, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out just below the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acicarpha lanata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in grassland and savannah habitats, often found in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with open woodland and shrubland environments. It is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Acicarpha lanata plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing forage for livestock and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acicarpha lanata was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It is particularly effective in reclaiming degraded lands and promoting biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive itself.</p>
