                    <h1>Adenium obesum var. multiflorum</h1>
<p>Adenium obesum var. multiflorum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a striking succulent native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, waxy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright red, trumpet-shaped flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its sap and tissues.</p>
