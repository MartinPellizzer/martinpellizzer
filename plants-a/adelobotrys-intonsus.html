                <h1>Adelobotrys intonsus</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys intonsus, commonly known as the slender false ivy, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys intonsus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branched pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in axillary inflorescences, and have a tubular shape with five lobes, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys intonsus is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Cundinamarca, Boyaca, and Nari√±o. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. It is often associated with rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys intonsus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed environments, including roadsides, gardens, and agricultural areas. The plant has shown rapid spread due to its ability to establish itself in nutrient-poor soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
