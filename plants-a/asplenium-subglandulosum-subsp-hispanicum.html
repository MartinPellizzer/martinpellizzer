<p>Asplenium subglandulosum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish spleenwort, is a fern species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, glandular hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to various microhabitats and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions.</p>
