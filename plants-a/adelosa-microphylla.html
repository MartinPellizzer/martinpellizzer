                <h1>Adelosa microphylla</h1>
<p>Adelosa microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved adelosa, is a member of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive corolla that is often pink or red in color.</p>
<p>Adelosa microphylla is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelosa microphylla has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelosa microphylla is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, often in dunes or heathland environments. This plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastal climate. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Adelosa microphylla is a hardy, low-growing shrub that is well-suited to the temperate to subtropical climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelosa microphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since spread across various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become a potential invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to monitor and control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
