                <h1>Abarema celebica</h1>
<p>Abarema celebica, commonly known as the Celebes stink bean, is a climbing legume native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive pods that contain a dark, oily seed known for its strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique fragrance and nutritional value, it holds cultural and culinary significance in its native region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abarema celebica has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with leaflets that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and are dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema celebica is a species of flowering plant native to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and the neighboring region of the Moluccas.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across these islands, particularly in lowland and montane forest areas. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and partial shade. Abarema celebica is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is currently listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abarema celebica is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and promote healthy growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abarema celebica is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of surrounding vegetation. Its dense foliage also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and forest edges.</p>
<p>Overall, Abarema celebica plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
