                <h1>Adesmia sulina</h1>
<p>Adesmia sulina, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Adesmia sulina is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia sulina has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia sulina is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic area within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia sulina was mainly introduced to areas with warm, arid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as parts of Australia, South Africa, and the western United States. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, small, white flowers. It has been introduced to new environments, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited by its preference for full sun and minimal water.</p>
