                <h1>Acourtia reticulata</h1>
<p>Acourtia reticulata, commonly known as the netleaf acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, net-like pattern of veins. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral environments.</p>
<p>Acourtia reticulata is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia reticulata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is upright, covered in a smooth, greyish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern as it matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia reticulata is primarily native to Guatemala, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in the diverse ecosystems of these regions, including arid and semi-arid areas. It is commonly associated with rocky soils and can be found in scrublands and desert environments. The plant's distribution spans across parts of Central America and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the climate and environmental conditions of these native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia reticulata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with a temperate climate, often found in coastal or riverine habitats. This plant is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate light foot traffic. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is often limited by its specific environmental requirements.</p>
