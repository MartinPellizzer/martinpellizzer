                <h1>Aconitum napellus subsp. splendens</h1>
<p>Aconitum napellus subsp.</p>
<p>splendens, commonly known as the splendour aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to central and southern Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September.</p>
<p>The plant has a tall, sparsely branched stem with large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply cut and hairy. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus subsp.</p>
<p>splendens has large, compound leaves that are doubly pinnate, with a deep green color and a rough texture, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, dark green bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures.</p>
<p>Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred shape, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus subsp.</p>
<p>splendens is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps. Its current distribution includes parts of Central and Eastern Europe, though it is now considered rare and fragmented.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is listed as vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus subsp.</p>
<p>splendens is a striking perennial plant known for its showy blue or purple flowers. It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination.</p>
<p>This plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing foliage in the first year and flowering in the second before dying back. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus subsp.</p>
<p>splendens is a striking perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its vibrant blue to purple flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic and ecological value of the surrounding flora. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in moist, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>This plant also offers shelter and habitat for small invertebrates and can contribute to the overall health of wetland or woodland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus subsp.</p>
<p>splendens is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant blue or purple flowers, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. While it is not used in culinary applications due to its toxic nature, it has historical significance in traditional medicine, where its alkaloids were once used for pain relief and as a poison.</p>
<p>The plant has no significant industrial or economic applications, but its presence in botanical collections contributes to ecological and scientific research. Culturally, it is often associated with the genus Aconitum, which has symbolic meanings in various mythologies and folklore.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should never be handled or ingested without proper expertise.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus subsp.</p>
