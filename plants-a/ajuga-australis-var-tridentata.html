                    <h1>Ajuga australis var. tridentata</h1>
<p>Ajuga australis var. tridentata, commonly known as three-toothed bugloss, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with three prominent lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded gardens.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful groundcover plant.</p>
