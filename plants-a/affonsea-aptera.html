<p>Affonsea aptera, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are often branched and can grow in a shrub-like form, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to store water, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
