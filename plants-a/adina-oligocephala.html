                <h1>Adina oligocephala</h1>
<p>Adina oligocephala, commonly known as the small-headed adina, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and the fruit is a small, smooth capsule containing several seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina oligocephala has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it matures.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina oligocephala is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed sites. It is also present in parts of eastern India and southern China.</p>
<p>Adina oligocephala is known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina oligocephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and riverine environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
