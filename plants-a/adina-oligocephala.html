                <h1>Adina oligocephala</h1>
<p>Adina oligocephala, commonly known as the small-headed adina, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, smooth fruits.</p>
<p>Adina oligocephala is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina oligocephala has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina oligocephala is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of the Indo-Malayan region, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing under the canopy of tropical rainforests. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Adina oligocephala is considered a species of conservation concern, with limited data on its population trends.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina oligocephala is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and requiring a period of dormancy during colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and encourage growth should be done annually. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina oligocephala is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
