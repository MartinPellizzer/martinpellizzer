<p>Adiantum caryotideum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and graceful foliage make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
