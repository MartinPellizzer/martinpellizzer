                <h1>Achillea leucanthema</h1>
<p>Achillea leucanthema, commonly known as white yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided, linear, and covered in a soft, silvery down, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>White yarrow is often used in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green on top, and silver-white underneath, with a rough texture and alternate arrangement.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of North America, including the Pacific Northwest and some areas of the southwestern United States. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and rocky areas. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is listed as a species of concern in some regions due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is a perennial flowering plant known for its delicate white flowers and easy care requirements.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes in early spring or by sowing seeds in a well-draining seed starting mix. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring can enhance growth, while regular pruning after blooming helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance garden diversity. It also helps with erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and animals, supporting a healthy ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is a flowering plant commonly known as white yarrow, which has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.</p>
