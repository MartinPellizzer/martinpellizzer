                <h1>Achillea leucanthema</h1>
<p>Achillea leucanthema, commonly known as white yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with multiple stems that rise from a short, fibrous root system. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided, linear, and covered in a soft, grayish-white down.</p>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema has compound, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, gray-green in color, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are white, clustered in flat-topped umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>It is now found in several states across the western U.S., including Oregon and Idaho, though its distribution has become fragmented. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as threatened or endangered in several states, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is a low-maintenance perennial known for its fluffy white flower heads and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a compact growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early fall, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with deep watering during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring helps promote growth, and light pruning after flowering keeps it tidy. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its beauty and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and habitat for small insects and ground-dwelling wildlife. It acts as an effective companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea leucanthema is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia, known for its white to pale yellow flowers and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use, primarily as a minor herb in some traditional recipes.
