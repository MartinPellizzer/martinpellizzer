                    <h1>Achillea leucanthema</h1>
<p>Achillea leucanthema, commonly known as white yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided, linear, and covered in a soft, silvery down, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>White yarrow is often used in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
