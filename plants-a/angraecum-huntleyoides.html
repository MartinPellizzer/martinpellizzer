                    <h1>Angraecum huntleyoides</h1>
<p>Angraecum huntleyoides, commonly known as the Huntley's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces pendulous, star-shaped blooms that are adapted for pollination by moths, a unique trait among orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
