                    <h1>Azorella biloba f. subglabra</h1>
<p>Azorella biloba f. subglabra, commonly known as the glabrous cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit forming low cushions or mats. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced or absent pubescence, giving it a smooth, glabrous appearance.</p>
