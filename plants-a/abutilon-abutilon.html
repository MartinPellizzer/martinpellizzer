<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon abutilon is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions spanning from Brazil to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Central America and the Caribbean. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings.
