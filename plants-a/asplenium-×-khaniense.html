                    <h1>Asplenium × khaniense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × khaniense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a dark green coloration and a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common to many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
