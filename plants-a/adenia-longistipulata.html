                <h1>Adenia longistipulata</h1>
<p>Adenia longistipulata, commonly known as the long-stipule adenium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features thick, woody stems and has palmate leaves with long, slender stipules. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia longistipulata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia longistipulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish in color, and it exhibits a scrambling or climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in axillary cymes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and serve to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia longistipulata is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern parts of the island, where the climate is tropical and humid. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. It is part of the Menispermaceae family and is known for its distinctive morphology.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia longistipulata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and greenhouses. This plant is often found in the understorey of forests, where it benefits from dappled sunlight and consistent moisture. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering structure.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent potential invasiveness in natural ecosystems.</p>
