                <h1>Adiantum heteroclitum</h1>
<p>Adiantum heteroclitum, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a pale midrib. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adiantum heteroclitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum heteroclitum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green, with a light, silvery underside, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. This species does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum heteroclitum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in forest understories. Its distribution includes both lowland and montane habitats.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in parts of the Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum heteroclitum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It has been reported in both urban and rural environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
