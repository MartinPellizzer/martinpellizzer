                <h1>Aconitum glabrum</h1>
<p>Aconitum glabrum, commonly known as the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum glabrum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing to a height of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, with five petal-like sepals and showy, spurred petals, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often forming a dense network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum glabrum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. This plant is commonly found in countries such as France, Italy, Germany, and the Czech Republic. It prefers cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Aconitum glabrum is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum glabrum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, woodland habitats and along stream banks. The plant was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental seed dispersal. It is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
