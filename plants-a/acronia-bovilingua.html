                    <h1>Acronia bovilingua</h1>
<p>Acronia bovilingua, commonly known as the whispering bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet. The plant produces small, rounded leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It blooms during the cooler months, typically between September and November.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Acronia bovilingua is considered a conservation concern.</p>
