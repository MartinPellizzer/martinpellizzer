                <h1>Actinocheita potentillifolia</h1>
<p>Actinocheita potentillifolia, commonly known as the woolly mountain bluet, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Actinocheita potentillifolia is a hardy species adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocheita potentillifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, corymbose inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocheita potentillifolia is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in disturbed environments such as dunes, roadsides, and open grasslands. It is also present in parts of Oregon and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocheita potentillifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
