                <h1>Adelobotrys saxosus</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys saxosus, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Adelobotrys saxosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys saxosus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is generally grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a trailing or creeping pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains one or two seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys saxosus is primarily native to Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the northern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on limestone formations. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is a rare and localized species with a restricted natural range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys saxosus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and rocky habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in dry, well-drained environments. This plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal capabilities. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in several parts of the world, including California and Chile.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include manual removal and the use of herbicides in affected areas.</p>
