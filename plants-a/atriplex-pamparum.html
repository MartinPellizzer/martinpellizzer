<p>Atriplex pamparum, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Atriplex pamparum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor, saline conditions.</p>
