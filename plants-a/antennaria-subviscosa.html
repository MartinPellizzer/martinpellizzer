                    <h1>Antennaria subviscosa</h1>
<p>Antennaria subviscosa, commonly known as the sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid or sandy habitats. It thrives in open, disturbed areas such as dunes, rocky slopes, and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Antennaria subviscosa is part of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
