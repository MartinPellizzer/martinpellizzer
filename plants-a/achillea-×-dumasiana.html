                <h1>Achillea × dumasiana</h1>
<p>Achillea × dumasiana, commonly known as the Dumas yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × dumasiana has basal,丛生 leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark, and grows in a clump-like pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from early summer to late summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, a type of achene, which is dispersed by wind due to its small size and feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × dumasiana is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, France, and Italy, where it thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters, preferring well-drained soils and temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × dumasiana is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, with cuttings also being a viable option during the growing season. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from early summer to late fall, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure, requiring minimal watering once established. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with lavender, thyme, and other drought-tolerant plants in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × dumasiana is a perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its dense foliage. Additionally, its deep root system helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea × dumasiana is a perennial flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in gardens and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary applications, though some parts of the plant may be used in small quantities in traditional herbal teas.
