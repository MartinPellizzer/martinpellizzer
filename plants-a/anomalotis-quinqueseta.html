<p>Anomalotis quinqueseta, commonly known as the five-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant has a slender, yellowish stem with five pairs of small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain regions.</p>
