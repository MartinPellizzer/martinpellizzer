                            <h1>Achyronia Recurva</h1>
<p>Common milkweed, scientifically known as Achyronia recurva, is a hardy perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows. This species plays a vital role in supporting native pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing essential nectar and host plant for their larvae. Its distinctive foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers make it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Despite its ecological importance, Common milkweed is often overlooked in favor of more ornamental plants.</p>
