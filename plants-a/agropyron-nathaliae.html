<p>Agropyron nathaliae, commonly known as the Nathalia's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Agropyron nathaliae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying alpine flora.</p>
