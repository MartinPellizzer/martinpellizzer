<p>Amphibolia saginata, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in spikes above the water, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Amphibolia saginata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
