<p>Androsace primuloides, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cooler climates.</p>
