                        <h1>Acanthophyllum glandulosum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly acanthophyllum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum glandulosum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum glandulosum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternation of generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and clubmosses. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive floral structures and often adapted to arid environments. Its family is Caryophyllaceae, commonly known as the carnation family, which includes many flowering plants with showy flowers and often succulent leaves. Its genus is Acanthophyllum, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid regions, characterized by their spiny or thorny structures.</p>
<p>Its species is Acanthophyllum glandulosum, a specific type of plant within the genus Acanthophyllum, known for its glandular features and adaptation to harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum glandulosum is primarily native to Afghanistan, Iran, Tadzhikistan, and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with low rainfall. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Central Asian and Iranian plateaus.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum glandulosum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure, making it well-suited for disturbed or degraded landscapes. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes, inland dunes, and along roadsides where it can establish quickly. Its introduction has been observed in several regions of the western United States, including Nevada and California.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
