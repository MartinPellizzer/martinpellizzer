                <h1>Acrostichum brasiliense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian shield fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-shaped base.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum brasiliense has large, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 2 meters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a upright, clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, while the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to wet, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum brasiliense is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans the eastern coast of Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is commonly found in wetlands and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.</p>
<p>Acrostichum brasiliense plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum brasiliense was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of southern Brazil, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dune ecosystems and mangrove forests, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. This plant is adapted to high salinity and wind exposure, making it an important species for coastal restoration projects. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded coastal lands and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its spread is carefully managed to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
