                    <h1>Ajuga chamaepitys var. glabriuscula</h1>
<p>Ajuga chamaepitys var. glabriuscula, commonly known as smoothleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabriuscula' has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful groundcover in natural landscapes.</p>
