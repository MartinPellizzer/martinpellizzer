                    <h1>Acrostichum stenopteris</h1>
<p>Acrostichum stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, dichotomous fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as streams and marshes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in wet soil, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
