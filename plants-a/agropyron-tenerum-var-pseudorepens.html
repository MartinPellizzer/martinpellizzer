                    <h1>Agropyron tenerum var. pseudorepens</h1>
<p>Agropyron tenerum var. pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread extensively across open habitats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with slender, awned glumes, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish-green hue, with a rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
