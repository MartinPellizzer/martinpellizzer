<p>Anomalopterys, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often asymmetrical fronds that give them a unique and sometimes ghostly appearance. Anomalopterys species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Their fronds are usually leathery and have a rough, serrated edge.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with variations in leaf shape and size, but all sharing the characteristic irregularity of their foliage.</p>
