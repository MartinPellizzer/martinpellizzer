                <h1>Adonis brevistyla</h1>
<p>Adonis brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range.</p>
<p>Adonis brevistyla is also noted for its ornamental value in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis brevistyla has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish-brown, growing from the base to a height of about 30â€“60 cm. Its flowers are yellow and consist of five petals, with a short tube and a spurred shape, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis brevistyla is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including parts of France, Italy, Spain, and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species is commonly found in alpine meadows and open slopes where it receives ample sunlight. It is also present in some areas of the Caucasus and western Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis brevistyla was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. This plant has been documented in several states including Washington, Oregon, and California. Its introduction is believed to be due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
