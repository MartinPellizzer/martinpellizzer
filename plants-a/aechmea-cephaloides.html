                <h1>Aechmea cephaloides</h1>
<p>Aechmea cephaloides, commonly known as the helmet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>Aechmea cephaloides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea cephaloides has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and covered in dense white hairs, arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green with a silvery-blue underside, and they can grow up to 40 cm in length. The plant has a short, thick, and fibrous stem that is usually hidden beneath the leaves, with a rough, bark-like texture. It produces inflorescences with bright red bracts that enclose small white to yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for water storage.</p>
