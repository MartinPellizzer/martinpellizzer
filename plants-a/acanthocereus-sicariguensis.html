<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with dry limestone habitats and is well adapted to the tropical climate of its native range. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is known for its distinctive spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
