<p>Astragalus oltensis, commonly known as the Olt Valley milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Romania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Astragalus oltensis plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
