<p>Arundo zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger reed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water sources such as rivers and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
