                    <h1>Alchemilla alpina var. typica</h1>
<p>Alchemilla alpina var. typica, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience.</p>
