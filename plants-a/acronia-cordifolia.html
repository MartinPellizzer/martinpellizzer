<p>Acronia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf acronia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Acronia cordifolia is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia cordifolia has heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale gray bark that peels in thin layers.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia cordifolia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. This plant is commonly found in the Florida Panhandle and the coastal regions of Georgia. It prefers moist, sandy soils and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia cordifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in temperate climates and has shown adaptability to a range of environmental conditions. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including landscaping and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
