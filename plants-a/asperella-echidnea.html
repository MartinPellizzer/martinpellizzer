                    <h1>Asperella echidnea</h1>
<p>Asperella echidnea, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts, through its specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Asperella echidnea plays a role in the ecological balance by supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
