<p>Aquilegia desolaticola, commonly known as the desert columbine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred petals and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows from a basal rosette of leaves and produces tall, sparsely branched stems. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
