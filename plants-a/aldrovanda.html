                    <h1>Aldrovanda</h1>
<p>Aldrovanda, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of tiny, snap-trap leaves that rapidly close around prey. The plant's stems are slender and often float just below the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its unique trapping mechanism and delicate appearance make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
