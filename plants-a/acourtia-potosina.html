                <h1>Acourtia potosina</h1>
<p>Acourtia potosina, commonly known as the Potosí dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk.</p>
<p>Acourtia potosina is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia potosina has small, gray-green, hairy leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 1–2 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that remains smooth throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia potosina is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí, and Tamaulipas. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the region. It is often found in shrublands and along rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Acourtia potosina is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia potosina was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern region, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in states such as Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, where it has adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates. Although it is not native to these areas, it has become established in certain ecological niches, often growing in rocky soils and along disturbed landscapes. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are being developed to control its spread and minimize its ecological effects.</p>
