<p>Albizia tomentella subsp.</p>
<p>tomentella, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are covered in a dense, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in summer and attract various pollinators. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The wood is lightweight and used locally for construction and furniture, though the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
