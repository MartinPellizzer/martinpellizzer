                    <h1>Aristolochia helix</h1>
<p>Aristolochia helix, commonly known as the spiral honeysuckle, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves and fragrant, hooded flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its unique morphology and historical use in traditional medicine have made it a subject of both botanical interest and caution.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture despite its ornamental value.</p>
