                <h1>Acrotriche depressa</h1>
<p>Acrotriche depressa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Acrotriche depressa is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a hardy species found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche depressa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant is commonly found.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche depressa is primarily native to South Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the northern and central areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as plains and salt lakes. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the southern parts of the Australian continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche depressa was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil types. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
