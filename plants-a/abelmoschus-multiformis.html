                        <h1>Abelmoschus multiformis</h1>
<p>Abelmoschus multiformis, commonly known as the Indian okra or *Abelmoschus manihot*, is a flowering plant in the mallow family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are edible and can be cooked like other leafy greens.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop in various climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus multiformis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open fields and along the edges of forests. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus multiformis was mainly introduced to areas where it has become an invasive species, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along waterways. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which can be dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in several regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
