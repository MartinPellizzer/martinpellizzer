<p>Alniaria folgneri, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Alniaria folgneri plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees.</p>
