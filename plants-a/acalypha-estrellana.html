                <h1>Acalypha estrellana</h1>
<p>Acalypha estrellana, commonly known as Estrellana's spurflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spade-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Acalypha estrellana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha estrellana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and often slightly hairy, with a light green to pale brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are greenish-white with stamen filaments that are often brightly colored, blooming in late spring to early summer and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha estrellana is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America, specifically found in countries like Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also present in parts of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia, where it has been introduced. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha estrellana is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and blooming during the summer months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha estrellana is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in sensitive areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by improving soil quality and offering habitat for small animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
