                    <h1>Avena flavescens var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Avena flavescens var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender oat, is a grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant.</p>
