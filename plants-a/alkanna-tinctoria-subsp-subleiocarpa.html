<p>Alkanna tinctoria subsp.</p>
<p>subleiocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red dye plant, is a species native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy roots that contain a deep red dye used historically for coloring textiles and cosmetics.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to its harsh native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and for traditional dye production.</p>
