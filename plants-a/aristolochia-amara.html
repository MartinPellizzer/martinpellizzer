<p>Aristolochia amara, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, typically ranging in color from yellow to greenish-white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. Its fruits are elongated, green berries that mature to a dark blue or black color.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, Aristolochia amara contains toxic compounds and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
