                    <h1>Aporodes</h1>
<p>Aporodes, commonly known as the "garden spurge," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Aporodes typically have simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. They are often found in dry, disturbed soils and are native to various regions in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>Due to their toxicity, they are generally avoided in ornamental gardening but are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
