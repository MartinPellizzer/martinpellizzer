                    <h1>Arenaria gypsophiloides var. glabra</h1>
<p>Arenaria gypsophiloides var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, glabrous leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is often found in gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which set it apart from other variants of the species.</p>
