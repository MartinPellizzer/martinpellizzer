                    <h1>Anoectochilus pumilus</h1>
<p>Anoectochilus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf helmet orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip, which is a key feature of the Anoectochilus genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections.</p>
