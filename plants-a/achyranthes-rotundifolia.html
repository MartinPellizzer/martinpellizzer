                <h1>Achyranthes rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Achyranthes rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features opposite, rounded leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rotundifolia has leaves that are round or kidney-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in diameter, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rotundifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments like forest floors or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen growing in disturbed soils or cultivated areas. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions across these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rotundifolia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-modified landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas where it can thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. This plant has become an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its success in new environments.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed due to its persistence and adaptability.</p>
