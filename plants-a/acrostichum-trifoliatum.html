                <h1>Acrostichum trifoliatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery fronds that are divided into three distinct segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern.</p>
<p>Acrostichum trifoliatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum trifoliatum has trifoliate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 10â€“20 cm in length with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern, with a light brown bark that becomes rough with age. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum trifoliatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern thrives in humid environments with rich, organic soil. Its distribution includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in parts of the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum trifoliatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and tolerance to waterlogged soils. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been expanded through both natural spread and human activity.</p>
