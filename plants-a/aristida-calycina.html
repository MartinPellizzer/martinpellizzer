                    <h1>Aristida calycina</h1>
<p>Aristida calycina, commonly known as the silky grass or slender false rice, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry environments.</p>
<p>Aristida calycina is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
