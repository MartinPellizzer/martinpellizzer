<p>Agrostis burttii, commonly known as Burtt's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Agrostis burttii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
