                    <h1>Aristida schaeferi</h1>
<p>Aristida schaeferi, commonly known as Sch√§fer's threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Aristida schaeferi plays a minor ecological role in its native range but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and adaptive traits.</p>
