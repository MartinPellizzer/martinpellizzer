                <h1>Asplenium platyneuron</h1>
<p>Asplenium platyneuron, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds with a distinctive silvery underside, which gives it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, and they often exhibit a graceful, arching growth habit.</p>
