                    <h1>Asplenium hangzhouense</h1>
<p>Asplenium hangzhouense, commonly known as the Hangzhou spleenwort, is a rare and endemic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, intricately lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
