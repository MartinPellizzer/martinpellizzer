                    <h1>Ariocarpus prismaticus</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus prismaticus, commonly known as the prismatic barrel cactus, is a slow-growing succulent native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Ariocarpus prismaticus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
