                <h1>Acer tienchuanense</h1>
<p>Acer tienchuanense, commonly known as the Tienchuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Its samaras, or winged seeds, are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tienchuanense has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and are dark green on top with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a straight trunk. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tienchuanense is a rare deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwest China, specifically in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, where it grows in humid subtropical climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in mixed forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer tienchuanense is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tienchuanense is a rare maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of leaf color change in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches is recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tienchuanense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its spring blossoms, aiding in the reproduction of other plant species. The tree also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of nearby flora by improving soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer tienchuanense plays a role in carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tienchuanense is a rare species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its fine grain and strength, making it suitable for furniture and crafts. In traditional Chinese medicine, parts of the plant may be used for their purported health benefits, though research is limited. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in local landscapes and botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Its role in biodiversity conservation highlights its significance in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tienchuanense has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is not widely cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, some popular cultivars have been developed for their ornamental value, such as 'Bailong' and 'Jingyue,' which are appreciated for their vibrant autumn foliage. Hybrids involving Acer tienchuanense are rare due to its restricted geographic range and limited genetic diversity. Despite its low horticultural importance compared to more common maple species, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological and scientific study.</p>
