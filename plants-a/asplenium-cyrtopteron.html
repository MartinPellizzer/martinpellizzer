                    <h1>Asplenium cyrtopteron</h1>
<p>Asplenium cyrtopteron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Asplenium cyrtopteron is a relatively uncommon species, with a limited geographic distribution primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
