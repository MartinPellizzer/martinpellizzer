<p>Aster coriaceus, commonly known as the rough aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple, blue, or white, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a slightly aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Aster coriaceus is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
