                    <h1>Anagallidium tetrapetalum</h1>
<p>Anagallidium tetrapetalum, commonly known as the four-petaled broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
