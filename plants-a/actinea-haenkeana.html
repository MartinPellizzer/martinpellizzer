                <h1>Actinea haenkeana</h1>
<p>Actinea haenkeana, commonly known as the Chilean starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves that are divided into several lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, often white or greenish in color.</p>
<p>Actinea haenkeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea haenkeana has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender, often branching at the base, and has a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea haenkeana is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes within the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in temperate to cool climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with alpine environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea haenkeana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
