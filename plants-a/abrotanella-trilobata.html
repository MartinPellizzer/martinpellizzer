                        <h1>Abrotanella trilobata</h1>
<p>Abrotanella trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three lobes, and the flowers are usually pink or purple.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abrotanella trilobata belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis and their complex cellular structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often spore-producing reproductive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Asterales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have composite flowers and are often found in diverse habitats around the world. Its family is Asteraceae, commonly known as the sunflower family, characterized by their head-like inflorescences and a wide variety of species. Its genus is Abrotanella, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, known for their small, often clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abrotanella trilobata, a specific plant within the genus Abrotanella, distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanella trilobata is primarily native to Argentina South and Chile South.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of these countries, particularly in areas with dry and semi-arid climates. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the local environmental conditions, including limited rainfall and varying temperatures.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its preference for the specific ecological niches present in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanella trilobata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
