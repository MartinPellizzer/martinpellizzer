<p>Acanthocereus acutangulus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick stems, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its striking floral display and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
