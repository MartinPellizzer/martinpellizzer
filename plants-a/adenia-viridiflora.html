                <h1>Adenia viridiflora</h1>
<p>Adenia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered adenium, is a striking plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with thick, corky bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its common name. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia viridiflora has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green in color, with a smooth surface and slightly wavy margins, typically measuring around 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, greenish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are large, showy, and borne in clusters, featuring three petals that are greenish-white with a yellow center, blooming during the wet season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia viridiflora is primarily native to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these Southeast Asian countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. Adenia viridiflora is part of the Barbataniaceae family and is known for its unique leaf and flower structures.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the mountainous and lowland areas of the mentioned countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia viridiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of horticultural collections and botanical research.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the North Island, particularly in areas with moist, shaded conditions. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its ornamental value. Although it is not considered invasive, it requires careful management to prevent spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has contributed to the diversity of plant life in New Zealand's botanical gardens.</p>
