                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
