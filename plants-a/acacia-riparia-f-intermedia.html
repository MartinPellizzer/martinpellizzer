<p>Acacia riparia f. intermedia, commonly known as the river acacia or slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by long, slender pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
