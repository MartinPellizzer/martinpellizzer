                    <h1>Angolluma kulalensis</h1>
<p>Angolluma kulalensis, commonly known as the Kulalensis Ghostplant, is a rare and elusive species native to the rainforests of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is notable for its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
