                <h1>Adiantum emarginatum</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Adiantum emmarginatum, commonly known as the notched maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive notched margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, with a silvery underside that reflects light.</p>
<p>Adiantum emmarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum emarginatum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure around 20-30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a dark green color, with a smooth, glossy surface and a distinctive notched or emarginate tip. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is green and slightly hairy, growing in a clump-forming pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum emarginatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along streams, in forests, or on rocky outcrops. It is known for its delicate fronds and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The plant's natural habitat reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum emarginatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is often spread through human activity, including the movement of soil and plant material.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, raising concerns among conservationists.</p>
