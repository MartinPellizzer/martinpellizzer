<p>Antirrhinum glutinosum var. africanum, commonly known as the African stickyweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typical of the plantain family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions on its stems and leaves are a distinctive botanical characteristic, aiding in water retention and deterring herbivores.</p>
