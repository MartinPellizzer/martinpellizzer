<p>Antennaria alpina var. cana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude environments with full sun exposure.</p>
