                    <h1>Apocynum</h1>
<p>Apocynum, commonly known as dogbane, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. They typically have opposite leaves and produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow. The genus includes several species, such as Apocynum cannabinum, which is native to North America.</p>
<p>Many Apocynum species are used in traditional medicine, though their use is often limited due to their toxic properties.</p>
