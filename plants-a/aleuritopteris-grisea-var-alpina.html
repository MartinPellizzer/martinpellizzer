<p>Aleuritopteris grisea var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a variant of the genus Aleuritopteris, characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to high-altitude regions of Asia, including the Himalayas and parts of China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, segmented stems that produce fertile spore-bearing leaves. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, airy appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>This fern is well adapted to rocky and shaded habitats, often growing in association with other alpine flora.</p>
