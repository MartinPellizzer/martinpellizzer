                <h1>Acrophorus immersus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus immersus, commonly known as the submerged acanthus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted for life in slow-moving or still water. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with its submerged stems and leaves forming a dense vegetation cover. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for water quality and aquatic ecosystem health.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus immersus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher and darker with age, and it grows upright with a climbing habit. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus immersus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments, typically found in the understorey of dense vegetation. This plant is commonly associated with swampy or seasonally flooded areas, where it adapts to waterlogged soil conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these tropical habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its native range has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus immersus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread throughout the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal and estuarine environments. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
