                    <h1>Angelica razulii var. prolifera</h1>
<p>Angelica razulii var. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping angelica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, and its large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely known angelica species.</p>
