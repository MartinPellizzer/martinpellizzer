<p>Ajuga abnormis, commonly known as the strange bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground cover.</p>
<p>Ajuga abnormis is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
