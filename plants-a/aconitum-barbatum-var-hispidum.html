                    <h1>Aconitum barbatum var. hispidum</h1>
<p>Aconitum barbatum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hispid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its "hispid" variety name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or garden settings.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas with small children or pets.</p>
