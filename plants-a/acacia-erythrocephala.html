                        <h1>Acacia erythrocephala</h1>
<p>Acacia erythrocephala, commonly known as the red-headed acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and distinctive, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in globular inflorescences, which are a notable feature. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often used in traditional Aboriginal practices.</p>
<p>Acacia erythrocephala is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open woodlands and coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia erythrocephala is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savanna and rocky habitats where it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of the local flora. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distinctive red seed pods and thorny structure make it easily identifiable in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia erythrocephala was mainly introduced to areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils, particularly in semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils where it forms dense thickets. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has been associated with land degradation in some regions due to its aggressive growth.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
