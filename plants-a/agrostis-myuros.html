                    <h1>Agrostis myuros</h1>
<p>Agrostis myuros, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Agrostis myuros is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
