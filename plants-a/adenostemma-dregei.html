                <h1>Adenostemma dregei</h1>
<p>Adenostemma dregei, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Adenostemma dregei is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma dregei has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dull green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with fine hairs, and has a brownish-gray bark that becomes rough with age, growing erect and branching sparingly. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pink to reddish petals, blooming from summer to autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
