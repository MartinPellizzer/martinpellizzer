                    <h1>Athyrium × mantoniae</h1>
<p>Athyrium × mantoniae, commonly known as the hybrid lace fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and conservatories for its elegant foliage.</p>
