                <h1>Acer liquidambarifolium</h1>
<p>Acer liquidambarifolium, commonly known as the golden maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The golden maple is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer liquidambarifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip; they are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, upright pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer liquidambarifolium is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely confined to its native range, with limited cultivation outside of China. It thrives in temperate to subtropical environments, often found in mixed forests and on slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer liquidambarifolium is classified as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer liquidambarifolium is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall colors and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer liquidambarifolium is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers and provides nectar and pollen throughout the growing season. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating a microhabitat for other plants and animals. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality, offering significant ecological benefits to its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer liquidambarifolium is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds can be used in traditional herbal remedies. The tree's wood is valued in the industrial sector for its strength and durability, contributing to economic activities in woodworking and furniture-making. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in certain regions, often featured in local art and landscaping.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and providing habitat for wildlife further highlights its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
