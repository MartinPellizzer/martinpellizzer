                    <h1>Asplenium repens</h1>
<p>Asplenium repens, commonly known as the running spleenwort, is a small, mat-forming fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It is often found growing on rocks, walls, or in damp soil, making it a common epiphyte or lithophyte.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ability to colonize various substrates make it an important component of moist forest ecosystems.</p>
