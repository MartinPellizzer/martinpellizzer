                <h1>Aconitum japonicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, helmet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum japonicum has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed leaflets that are typically blue-green in color and can reach up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, shady environments where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum japonicum is primarily native to Japan, Korea, and Manchuria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with moist, shaded environments. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of East Asia where it has been traditionally used in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum japonicum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the early 20th century by horticulturists and botanical enthusiasts. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species in wetland and riparian habitats. Its rapid spread is attributed to its ability to thrive in moist soils and reproduce through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>As a result, it is now considered a noxious weed in several states across the United States.</p>
