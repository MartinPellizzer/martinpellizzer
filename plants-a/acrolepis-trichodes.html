                <h1>Acrolepis trichodes</h1>
<p>Acrolepis trichodes, commonly known as the Cape dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dandelion-like appearance with yellow flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Acrolepis trichodes is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Acrolephis trichodes has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and slightly woody at the base, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually a reddish-brown color. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals and stamens, blooming from late autumn to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolepis trichodes is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry, rocky areas of the Karoo and Highveld regions. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent leaves and deep root system.</p>
<p>Acrolepis trichodes is a member of the Asteraceae family and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolepis trichodes was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate and soil conditions, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It has established itself in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, gardens, and degraded lands. The plant's rapid growth and reproductive capabilities contribute to its spread and potential invasiveness. It is particularly common in regions with warm, temperate climates and adequate rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a concern in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
