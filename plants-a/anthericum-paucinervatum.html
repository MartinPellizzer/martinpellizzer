<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, spadix-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
