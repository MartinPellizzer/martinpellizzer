                    <h1>Asplenium deflexum</h1>
<p>Asplenium deflexum, commonly known as the drooping spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are often curved or drooping, giving it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Asplenium genus.</p>
<p>The plant's simple, non-vascular structure allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients directly from the air and substrate.</p>
