                <h1>Acinodendron decussatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron decussatum, commonly known as the cross-leaved acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often have a slightly hairy surface. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that contains a single seed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron decussatum has alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath, with a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, blooming in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron decussatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed dipterocarp forests. Its distribution extends into parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron decussatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for soil stabilization.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a potential invasive species in non-native environments. It is typically distributed in tropical and subtropical regions across Asia, Africa, and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its competitive nature and potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
