                    <h1>Alsophila procera</h1>
<p>Alsophila procera, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of fibrous, decaying fronds. The plant produces large, bioluminescent spore-bearing cones at the top of its trunk, which are essential for reproduction. Its fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape that contributes to its dramatic appearance.</p>
<p>Alsophila procera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
