                            <h1>Andropogon Micranthus</h1>
<p>Little bluestem, scientifically known as Andropogon micranthus, is a native grass species commonly found in the central and eastern United States. It thrives in prairie ecosystems and is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and full sun exposure. This plant is known for its distinctive blue-green foliage and its ability to form dense, resilient turf that aids in soil stabilization. Little bluestem plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance and is often used in restoration projects. Its beauty and hardiness make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
