                    <h1>Achasma sphaerocephalum var. majus</h1>
<p>Achasma sphaerocephalum var. majus, commonly known as the giant globe lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its distinctive spherical or globular thallus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is known for its dense, crust-like growth form that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically yellowish to brownish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. This lichen is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth pattern make it an important indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
