                <h1>Acer opulifolium var. obtusatum</h1>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. obtusatum, commonly known as the Pacific maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and moist forests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a temperate climate.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. obtusatum has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to obovate in shape, with a rounded or obtuse tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn yellow to orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with an upright or spreading growth habit. It produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. obtusatum is a variant of the mountain maple, native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in parts of British Columbia and Washington State.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Oregon and Idaho, where it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often growing in association with other shade-tolerant species. This plant typically occurs at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where it benefits from cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution, though it remains relatively stable in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. obtusatum is a compact, ornamental maple known for its vibrant fall color and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or conifers enhances its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. obtusatum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the health of surrounding vegetation. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. obtusatum is a decorative shrub known for its ornamental value in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may have minor roles in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been used by indigenous communities for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local wildlife, enhancing ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in native traditions, representing resilience and connection to the land.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. obtusatum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, including 'Aureum' with its golden leaves and 'Variegatum' featuring striking yellow-variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization with other maple species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness or more vibrant fall color. These hybrids often exhibit a broader range of leaf shapes, colors, and growth habits, making them popular choices for landscape design. Horticulturally, this variety is valued for its adaptability to different climates and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its aesthetic appeal and versatility have contributed to its growing popularity in both public and private gardens.</p>
