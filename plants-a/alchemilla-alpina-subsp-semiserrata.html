<p>Alchemilla alpina subsp.</p>
<p>semiserrata, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of soft, silvery-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces upright flowering stems bearing small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
