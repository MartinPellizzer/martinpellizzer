                <h1>Achirida iridiflora</h1>
<p>Achirida iridiflora, commonly known as the blue-flowered orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant blue petals and a unique, intricate floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to efficiently capture moisture from the humid environment. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often producing a fragrant aroma that enhances its ecological role.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Achirida iridiflora is considered a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achirida iridiflora has compound, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, with six petals arranged in a radial symmetry, displaying a striking blue-violet color that attracts pollinators; they bloom in late spring and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achirida iridiflora is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and parts of northern Argentina. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within dense tropical forests. It is often associated with limestone soils and is found in the understory of evergreen and semi-deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many of its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achirida iridiflora was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its striking blue flowers. The plant has since spread to other tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to various environments.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in native ecosystems.</p>
