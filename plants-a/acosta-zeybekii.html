                <h1>Acosta zeybekii</h1>
<p>Acosta zeybekii, commonly known as the Zeybekii lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, humid climate to thrive. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta zeybekii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta zeybekii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that develops shallow vertical ridges as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta zeybekii is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, specifically parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found along cliffs and in dry, sunny environments. This plant is commonly associated with the Iberian Peninsula, including Spain and Portugal, as well as regions in Italy and Greece. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not commonly found beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta zeybekii was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and inland regions. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along streambanks. Its adaptability has led to its spread beyond its native range, raising concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
