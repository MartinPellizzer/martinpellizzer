                    <h1>Atriplex radiata</h1>
<p>Atriplex radiata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Atriplex radiata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is used in rehabilitation of degraded lands.</p>
