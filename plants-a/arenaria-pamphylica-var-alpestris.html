                    <h1>Arenaria pamphylica var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Arenaria pamphylica var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
