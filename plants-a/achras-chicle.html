                <h1>Achras chicle</h1>
<p>Achras chicle, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. Its latex, known as chicle, has been historically used in chewing gum.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras chicle has large, palm-like leaves that are typically broad, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant, with each leaf reaching up to 1 meter in length and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a spiny, spherical structure that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras chicle is a tropical plant native to Central America, specifically found in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Florida and the Caribbean, for its latex used in chewing gum. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil, typically growing in lowland tropical forests. A. chicle is usually found at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations face threats from habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras chicle is a tropical tree native to Central America, known for its latex production and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Achras chicle involves a slow initial growth phase followed by rapid expansion once it reaches maturity, typically within 5 to 7 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by scale insects and root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras chicle is a tropical plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, supporting biodiversity and soil health. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, enhancing the overall ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
