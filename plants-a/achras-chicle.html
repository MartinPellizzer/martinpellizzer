<p>Achras chicle, commonly known as the sapodilla tree, is a tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces a fruit with a hard, starchy interior and a sweet, aromatic pulp, which is the source of natural chewing gum. Its leaves are large, alternate, and palmately lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras chicle has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30–50 cm in diameter, with a dark green color and a rough, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is thick, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a sweet scent, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a spiny, spherical capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
