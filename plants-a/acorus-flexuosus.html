                    <h1>Acorus flexuosus</h1>
<p>Acorus flexuosus, commonly known as narrow-leaf sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, with a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist habitats, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acorus flexuosus is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
