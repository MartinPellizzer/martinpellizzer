                <h1>Acorus flexuosus</h1>
<p>Acorus flexuosus, commonly known as narrowleaf sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America and Asia.</p>
<p>It has sword-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Acorus flexuosus is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to help purify water in wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus flexuosus has long, sword-shaped leaves that are narrow and tapering, arranged in a helical pattern along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes purplish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and often slightly bent, with a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that has a creeping growth habit. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a spadix surrounded by a greenish spathe, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that matures into a dark blue or black color, and the seeds are dispersed by water or through bird droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps the plant spread and stabilize in wet environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus flexuosus is a wetland plant native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North America and Europe, often introduced through human activity. This species thrives in moist environments such as marshes, pond margins, and along streams. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Acorus flexuosus is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, although some local populations may face threats from habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus flexuosus is a versatile aquatic plant commonly grown in wetlands and water gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by planting rhizomes in shallow water. The growth cycle of Acorus flexuosus is perennial, with active growth during spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires consistent watering to maintain saturated conditions. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with water lilies or cattails can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus flexuosus is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a natural filter, helping to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients. Its dense growth also helps prevent erosion along water bodies.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant for other wetland species, enhancing biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
