                <h1>Acorus flexuosus</h1>
<p>Acorus flexuosus, commonly known as narrow-leaf sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, with a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist habitats, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acorus flexuosus is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus flexuosus has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, typically ranging from 30 to 100 cm in length and varying in color from bright green to a darker, more silvery hue.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, light green to yellowish bark that grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spadix enclosed by a leaf-like bract, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as beetles and flies. The fruit is a three-lobed, berry-like structure that matures into a dark brown seed capsule, with seeds dispersed by water or through the movement of the fruit itself.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus flexuosus is primarily native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often associated with riparian habitats. Its distribution spans across parts of Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>
<p>It is particularly common in regions with a humid climate and abundant freshwater resources.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus flexuosus was mainly introduced to wetland areas and shallow water environments in the United States, particularly in the eastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. This plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive, grass-like foliage. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a beneficial plant for water quality improvement and habitat creation.</p>
