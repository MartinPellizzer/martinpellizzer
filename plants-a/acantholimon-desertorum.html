The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Acantholimon desertorum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
