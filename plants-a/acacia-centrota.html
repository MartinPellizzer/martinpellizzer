                        <h1>Acacia centrota</h1>
<p>Acacia centrota, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. Its seeds are encased in a woody pod and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acacia centrota plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia centrota is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry to semi-arid regions, particularly in rocky soils and open woodlands. This species thrives in areas with low rainfall and is often associated with sandstone-derived soils. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, showing resilience to drought and heat.</p>
<p>Acacia centrota is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia centrota was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a windbreak in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly planted in degraded lands to stabilize soil and improve land productivity. The plant is also used for its hardy nature, which allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is often used in reclamation projects.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness in certain environments.</p>
