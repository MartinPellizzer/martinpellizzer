                <h1>Acer acutum</h1>
<p>Acer acutum, commonly known as the sharp-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply toothed leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>The bark of Acer acutum is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer acutum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length; they are dark green in summer and turn vibrant red or yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching pattern that is somewhat weeping in appearance. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread effectively in open areas.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer acutum is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, though it is less common outside its native range. It thrives in temperate forests and moist, well-drained soils, often found in shaded understory environments. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer acutum is considered to be of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer acutum is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The growth cycle of Acer acutum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by leaf color change in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are essential for optimal growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, and companion planting with plants like lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its growth and appearance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer acutum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in the spring. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, offering shade and habitat in mixed forest ecosystems. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer acutum is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and various practical uses.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its young leaves can be cooked and consumed, adding a unique flavor to local dishes. Medicinally, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Culturally, the tree holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and renewal.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer acutum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Cunningham's White' and 'Variegatum', which are noted for their striking foliage colors and unique leaf shapes. The species is also used in horticultural breeding programs to develop hybrids with improved hardiness and aesthetic features. Hybrid forms often combine the vibrant autumn colors of Acer acutum with the adaptability of other maple species.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids play an important role in landscaping and botanical gardens due to their visual appeal and versatility in different climates.</p>
