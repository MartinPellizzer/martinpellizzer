                    <h1>Acer acutum</h1>
<p>Acer acutum, commonly known as the sharp-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, red to orange flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The bark of Acer acutum is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age.</p>
