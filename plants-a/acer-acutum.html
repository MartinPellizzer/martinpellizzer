                <h1>Acer acutum</h1>
<p>Acer acutum, commonly known as the sharp-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, red to orange flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The bark of Acer acutum is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer acutum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a distinct life cycle that includes both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, which includes a variety of flowering plants, many of which have fruits that are capsules or berries. Its family is Sapindaceae, known for its diverse species that often have compound leaves and showy flowers. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maples, which are deciduous trees or shrubs with opposite leaves and distinctive samaras.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer acutum, a specific type of maple native to eastern Asia, characterized by its sharp, acuminate leaf tips and preference for moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer acutum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length; they are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching pattern that is generally regular. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer acutum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in temperate forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, cool environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer acutum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer acutum is a hardy maple tree known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The growth cycle of Acer acutum includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches is recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other shade-loving plants like hostas and ferns for companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer acutum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The tree also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby vegetation through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Acer acutum plays a vital role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer acutum is a species of maple tree native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap and leaves have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine texture, making it suitable for furniture and carving. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in traditional Chinese and Japanese gardens, representing resilience and beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity also contributes to its ecological and economic importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer acutum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Emperor', known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids of Acer acutum are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness, growth form, and seasonal color. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes due to their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in temperate climates for their vibrant autumn displays and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
