<p>Aulomyrcia bicudoensis, commonly known as the Bicudo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often-dry habitat.</p>
<p>Aulomyrcia bicudoensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its ecosystem, supporting local fauna through its fruit.</p>
