<p>Agave coetocapnia subsp.</p>
<p>clivicola, commonly known as the cliff-dwelling agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically blue-green in color with marginal teeth and a spiny margin, providing both structural support and a defense mechanism. It produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears white to pale green flowers, which are pollinated by insects and bats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant.</p>
