                <h1>Acinodendron ochraceum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Acinodendron ochraceum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ochraceum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-white petals and stamens, blooming from March to May, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ochraceum is primarily native to eastern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, forested areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with tropical and subtropical ecosystems. It is typically found in lowland and montane regions, growing in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Acinodendron ochraceum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ochraceum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed environments such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded in recent decades, posing challenges for ecosystem management.</p>
