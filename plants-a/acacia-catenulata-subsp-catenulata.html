                        <h1>Acacia catenulata subsp. catenulata</h1>
<p>Acacia catenulata subsp.</p>
<p>catenulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowers that appear in globular heads.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in coastal areas and is well-suited to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia catenulata subsp.</p>
<p>catenulata belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and flowering plants.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with five petals and include legumes and vetches. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of flowering plants commonly known as wattles, which are native to Australia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia catenulata, a specific type of acacia known for its unique branching pattern and is found in arid regions of Australia.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
