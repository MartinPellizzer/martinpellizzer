                    <h1>Athyrium griffithii</h1>
<p>Athyrium griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Athyrium griffithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
