                <h1>Acosta hanryi</h1>
<p>Acosta hanryi, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Acosta hanryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta hanryi has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta hanryi is primarily native to the highlands of southern Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean region, specifically in the provinces of Loja and Zamora. This plant typically grows in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level. It is often found in open, sunny areas within cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta hanryi was mainly introduced to the southern regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and degraded forests. This plant has adapted well to the tropical and subtropical climates of these areas. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including agricultural expansion and land clearing.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
