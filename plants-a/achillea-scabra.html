                <h1>Achillea scabra</h1>
<p>Achillea scabra, commonly known as rough yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of linear, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Achillea scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea scabra has leaves that are lanceolate to linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branched, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a greenish-yellow color. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in summer and attracting insects for pollination. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea scabra is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, particularly in regions like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny habitats, often growing on slopes and in open grasslands. It is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates and can be found in coastal areas as well.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into the Canary Islands, where it adapts to the unique island environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea scabra was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. The distribution of Achillea scabra has expanded into disturbed sites such as roadsides and forest edges. It has become naturalized in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the area.</p>
