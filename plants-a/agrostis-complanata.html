                    <h1>Agrostis complanata</h1>
<p>Agrostis complanata, commonly known as flatleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, flat leaves that are usually less than 1 cm wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Agrostis complanata is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes.</p>
