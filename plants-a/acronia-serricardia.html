                <h1>Acronia serricardia</h1>
<p>Acronia serricardia, commonly known as the serrated acronia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated edges and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Acronia serricardia typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia serricardia has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia serricardia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils within coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained environments and is often associated with saltwater ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia serricardia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like land clearing and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in both natural and agricultural settings.</p>
