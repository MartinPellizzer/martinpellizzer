                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera f. substerilis</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera f. substerilis, commonly known as the sterile form of bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced fertility, which results in the absence of viable seeds. This form typically exhibits a dense, low-growing turf that is often found in lawns and golf courses. Botanically, it has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Its sterile nature makes it less invasive compared to the fertile form, but it still contributes to the overall structure and appearance of the turf.</p>
