                        <h1>Acaena canescens</h1>
<p>Acaena canescens, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach or silver weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, red-orange flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene that contains a single seed.</p>
<p>Acaena canescens is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena canescens is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, temperate regions, including the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acaena canescens plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena canescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some environments due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
