<p>Agropyron cristatum subsp.</p>
<p>sclerophyllum, commonly known as the sand wheatgrasses, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its root system is extensive and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
