                <h1>Actinodaphne crassa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne crassa, commonly known as the rough-leafed laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often rough to the touch, giving it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, oval-shaped berries.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne crassa is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its aromatic properties and ornamental appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne crassa has broad, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a dense, bushy form. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that splits to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping stabilize the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne crassa is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid forest environments. It is commonly associated with lowland and mountainous areas where the climate is warm and moist.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the ecological conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne crassa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing in secondary forests or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and traditional uses in local medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
