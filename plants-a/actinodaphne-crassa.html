<p>Actinodaphne crassa, commonly known as the thick-leaf sandalwood, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and aromatic bark. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark, spherical berries. Its wood is valued for its fragrance and is used in traditional incense and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common understory plant in tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne crassa has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with greenish-white petals, clustered in inflorescences, and they bloom during the wet season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe, turning from green to red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and stability.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne crassa is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of peninsular Malaysia and the Philippines, though its range has become more restricted due to habitat loss. This plant thrives in tropical rainforests, often growing in shaded understory conditions. It is typically found at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to deforestation and habitat degradation, Actinodaphne crassa is currently listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne crassa is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Actinodaphne crassa is slow to moderate, with new growth appearing in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while diseases like root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant plants like ferns or orchids can enhance the aesthetic appeal of the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
