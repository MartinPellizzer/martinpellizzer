                <h1>Achras dactylina</h1>
<p>Achras dactylina, commonly known as the Natal date palm, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a straight trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits resembling dates. Its leaves are long and feathery, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The Natal date palm is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras dactylina has broad, palmate leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces large, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras dactylina is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coast. This plant is commonly found in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. It is well adapted to the warm, humid climate and salt spray of the coastal environment.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends along the shoreline where it forms part of the local vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras dactylina was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential as a source of edible fruits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of South America, the Caribbean, and some regions of Africa. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight to grow optimally. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its invasive potential in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite this, it remains a popular species in horticulture due to its attractive appearance and unique fruit characteristics.</p>
