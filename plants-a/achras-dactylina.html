<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras dactylina is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly found in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including southern Africa and some tropical regions. This plant thrives in hot, dry environments with well-drained soils, often growing in coastal dunes or rocky areas. It is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its restricted native habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes raise concerns for its long-term conservation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras dactylina is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Africa, known for its striking blue-gray foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics.
