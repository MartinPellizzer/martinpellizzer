                    <h1>Asplenium epiphyticum</h1>
<p>Asplenium epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, dark green, strap-shaped leaves that are often clustered in dense rosettes. This species typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Asplenium epiphyticum is an epiphyte, meaning it attaches to other plants for physical support but derives its moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Its simple, non-vascular structure makes it well adapted to humid, low-light conditions.</p>
