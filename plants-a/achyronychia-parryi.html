                <h1>Achyronychia parryi</h1>
<p>Achyronychia parryi, commonly known as the Parry's acanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronychia parryi has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slight rough texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronychia parryi is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. It is commonly associated with desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronychia parryi was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like Nevada, California, and Utah.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in areas with low precipitation. This plant is often associated with desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Its introduction has been primarily due to its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and plays a minor role in local flora.</p>
