                <h1>Arctostaphylos glandulosa</h1>
<p>Arctostaphylos glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in glandular dots, which give the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
