                    <h1>Acacia saxatilis</h1>
<p>Acacia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep roots and a waxy coating on the leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia saxatilis is often found on rocky outcrops and is well-suited to low-nutrient soils.</p>
