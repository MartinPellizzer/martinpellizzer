<p>It has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Androsace simplex is often found in meadows, scree slopes, and mountainous areas where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
