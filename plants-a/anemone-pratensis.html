                    <h1>Anemone pratensis</h1>
<p>Anemone pratensis, commonly known as the meadow anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive central yellow tuft. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Anemone pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
