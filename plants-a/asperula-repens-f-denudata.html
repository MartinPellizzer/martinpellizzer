                    <h1>Asperula repens f. denudata</h1>
<p>Asperula repens f. denudata, commonly known as the naked woodrush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it its "naked" appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or wet areas.</p>
