                    <h1>Anacampseros silvatica</h1>
<p>Anacampseros silvatica, commonly known as the forest stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid or rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the summer months. It is often found growing in well-drained soils on cliffs or slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
