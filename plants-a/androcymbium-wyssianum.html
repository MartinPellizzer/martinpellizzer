                    <h1>Androcymbium wyssianum</h1>
<p>Androcymbium wyssianum, commonly known as the Wiedemann's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that display a combination of white, yellow, and green hues, creating a visually stunning display. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological specificity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
