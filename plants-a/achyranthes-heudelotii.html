                <h1>Achyranthes heudelotii</h1>
<p>Achyranthes heudelotii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a hairy underside.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes heudelotii has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with greenish-white petals, blooming in summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes heudelotii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist savannas, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Asia, particularly in India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to some regions of the Middle East and northern Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes heudelotii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and abandoned lands. The plant is often considered an invasive species in many of these areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. It has been reported in countries like Madagascar, India, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as trade and agriculture.</p>
