<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in summer. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile choice for landscaping.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. albiflora has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, herbaceous, and have a slightly hairy texture, with a light green to reddish-brown color. The flowers are white, forming flat, composite heads with many small, tubular florets, blooming from early summer to late summer and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. albiflora is a flowering plant that is native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as the British Isles, Scandinavia, and the Alps, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and rocky soils, often in areas with well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found at altitudes ranging from lowlands up to around 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered a stable species with no immediate conservation concerns, though it is occasionally threatened by habitat loss due to human activity.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. albiflora is a low-maintenance perennial known for its delicate white flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity within one to two years, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, and pruning is recommended after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and attract beneficial pollinators.</p>
