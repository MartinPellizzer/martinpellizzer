                <h1>Acianthera antennata</h1>
<p>Acianthera antennata, commonly known as the antennate orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, which are attracted to their scent and color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera antennata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green in color and have a smooth, glossy texture. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a pale green bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a white to pale pink color, blooming during the summer months; they are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera antennata is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the states of Espírito Santo, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant is adapted to the high rainfall and warm climate characteristic of this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Atlantic Forest, making it a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera antennata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including urban environments and along roadsides. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade. Its introduction has led to its establishment in regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
