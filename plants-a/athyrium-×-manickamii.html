                    <h1>Athyrium × manickamii</h1>
<p>Athyrium × manickamii, commonly known as the Manickamii fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a refined and elegant appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
