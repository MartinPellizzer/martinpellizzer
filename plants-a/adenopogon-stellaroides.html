<p>Adenopogon stellaroides, commonly known as star-like grass, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the Great Plains and eastern regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and fields. It produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often pale green or blueish in color.</p>
<p>Adenopogon stellaroides is known for its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
