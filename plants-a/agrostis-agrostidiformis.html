                    <h1>Agrostis agrostidiformis</h1>
<p>Agrostis agrostidiformis, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent component of its native habitats.</p>
<p>Agrostis agrostidiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
