<p>Amphiscopia serpens, commonly known as the snake's head orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, winding stems that resemble a snake's body, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphiscopia serpens is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
