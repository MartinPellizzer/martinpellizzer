<p>Atriplex lindleyi subsp.</p>
<p>conduplicata, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded lands.</p>
<p>The subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
