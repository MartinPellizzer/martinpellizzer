                    <h1>Arundinaria pumila</h1>
<p>Arundinaria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, evergreen grass that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet.</p>
<p>It features slender, green culms that are covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>Arundinaria pumila is well-suited for shaded areas and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>
