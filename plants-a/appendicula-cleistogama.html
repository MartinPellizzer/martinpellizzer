<p>Appendicula cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous appendicula, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique habit of producing closed, self-fertilizing flowers, a reproductive strategy known as cleistogamy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized reproductive mechanisms and ecological adaptations.</p>
