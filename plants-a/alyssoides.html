                    <h1>Alyssoides</h1>
<p>Alyssoides, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like buttercups and anemones. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Alyssoides thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a common weed and a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators.</p>
