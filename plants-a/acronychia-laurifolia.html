<p>Acronychia laurifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved acronychia, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Acronychia laurifolia is valued for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia laurifolia has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath, with a moderate size and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, dark brown bark that exudes a strong scent when cut, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a compact, rounded shape. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
