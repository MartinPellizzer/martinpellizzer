                <h1>Adenophora latifolia</h1>
<p>Adenophora latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adenophora latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora latifolia has broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late summer and early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora latifolia is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous areas and forested environments. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Its distribution includes regions with a humid climate and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Adenophora latifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora latifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and vacant lots. This plant has a broad distribution in the northern hemisphere, including parts of Asia and North America. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates has contributed to its successful establishment in non-native regions.</p>
