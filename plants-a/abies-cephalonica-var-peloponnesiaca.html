                    <h1>Abies cephalonica var. peloponnesiaca</h1>
<p>Abies cephalonica var. peloponnesiaca, commonly known as the Peloponnesian fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of the Peloponnese in southern Greece.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the Cephalonica fir, characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its cones are typically small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
