<p>Aegilops triuncialis subsp.</p>
<p>orientalis, commonly known as the oriental false wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brown spikelets. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
