                    <h1>Actinolepis nubigena</h1>
<p>Actinolepis nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in high-altitude cloud forests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, often pale-colored flowers. The plant thrives in humid, misty environments where it clings to tree trunks or rocks, utilizing epiphytic growth habits. Its unique morphology includes specialized roots that absorb moisture from the air, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
