                <h1>Actinolepis nubigena</h1>
<p>Actinolepis nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in high-altitude cloud forests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, often pale-colored flowers. The plant thrives in humid, misty environments where it clings to tree trunks or rocks, utilizing epiphytic growth habits. Its unique morphology includes specialized roots that absorb moisture from the air, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolepis nubigena has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis nubigena is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is typically found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis nubigena was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with moist, shaded environments, often near water sources. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities in certain horticultural contexts.</p>
