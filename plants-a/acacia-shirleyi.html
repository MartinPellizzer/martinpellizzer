                    <h1>Acacia shirleyi</h1>
<p>Acacia shirleyi, commonly known as Shirley's wattle, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, a common adaptation in arid environments. Its woody stems are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia shirleyi is well adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>
