                <h1>Achillea × maxima</h1>
<p>Achillea × maxima, commonly known as the Yarrow hybrid, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery foliage and flat, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. It is native to the Mediterranean region but has been widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Achillea × maxima is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × maxima has compound, feather-like leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough texture and a silvery-white underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to light pink ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × maxima is a hybrid plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and Australia, where it is now cultivated. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its invasive potential in non-native areas raises concerns for local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × maxima is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flower heads and fern-like foliage, often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a typical biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender enhances its appearance and benefits from their pest-repelling properties.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
