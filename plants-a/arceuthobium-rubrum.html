                    <h1>Arceuthobium rubrum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium rubrum, commonly known as the red witchweed, is a parasitic plant that relies entirely on host plants for its survival.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, making it unable to perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, often attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to weaken and sometimes kill its host.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it has a unique life cycle and plays a role in certain ecosystems.</p>
