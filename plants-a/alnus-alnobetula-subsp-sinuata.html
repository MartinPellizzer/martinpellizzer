<p>Alnus alnobetula subsp.</p>
<p>sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along forest edges.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, supporting diverse plant and animal life in its habitat.</p>
