                    <h1>Acacia loroloba</h1>
<p>Acacia loroloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and it produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. Acacia loroloba is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
