<p>Asclepias pellucida, commonly known as the pale milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common feature among milkweeds. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slight hairy texture.</p>
<p>Asclepias pellucida plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
