                <h1>Acourtia pilulosa</h1>
<p>Acourtia pilulosa, commonly known as the pillowy acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that resemble pills, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Acourtia pilulosa is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia pilulosa has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia pilulosa is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is often seen in desert scrublands. The plant is adapted to withstand the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within central and southwestern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia pilulosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it common in coastal regions of California. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems, affecting biodiversity and habitat structure.</p>
<p>Management efforts often focus on controlling its spread through manual removal and herbicides.</p>
