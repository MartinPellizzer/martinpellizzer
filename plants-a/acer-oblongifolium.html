                <h1>Acer oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Acer oblongifolium, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in the spring followed by winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“25 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and urban environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in corymbs, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongifolium is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in regions of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas where it was historically present, though it is now considered rare and localized. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested environments, often in mixed hardwood forests. This species is typically found at low to mid-elevation ranges, usually between 100 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer oblongifolium is listed as endangered or threatened in several states, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongifolium is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove diseased branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it benefits from companion planting with native grasses and wildflowers.</p>
