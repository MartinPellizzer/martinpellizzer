                <h1>Acer oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Acer oblongifolium, commonly known as the oblong-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and green, appearing before the leaves in early spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, with distinctive ridges that become more pronounced as the tree matures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongifolium has leaves that are elongated and oval-shaped, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-10 cm in length; they are dark green on top and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed enclosed in a papery husk, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongifolium is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to a few scattered populations in the southeastern U.S. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often near streams or in shaded understories. This species typically grows at low to mid elevations, usually below 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer oblongifolium is considered endangered or critically endangered in many of its former ranges.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongifolium is a deciduous shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The growth cycle of Acer oblongifolium involves active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the plant and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongifolium is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, especially in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by offering ecological benefits like habitat creation and aesthetic value.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongifolium is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have limited traditional uses in some indigenous cultures. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though its applications remain largely underexplored. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports wildlife, making it valuable in conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and as a symbol of regional flora in North America.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongifolium has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, including 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum', which display striking coloration and leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, resulting in cultivars like 'Emerald Queen' and 'Autumn Blaze', which exhibit enhanced growth habits and seasonal color changes. These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in diverse climates and their visual appeal. The plant's adaptability makes it a popular choice for landscape design and urban gardening.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance is further highlighted by its role in creating vibrant, long-lasting garden displays.</p>
