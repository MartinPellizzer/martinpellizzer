                    <h1>Artemisia maritima var. communis</h1>
<p>Artemisia maritima var. communis, commonly known as sea wormwood, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator support. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
