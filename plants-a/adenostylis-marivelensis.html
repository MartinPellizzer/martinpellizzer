                <h1>Adenostylis marivelensis</h1>
<p>Adenostylis marivelensis, commonly known as the Marivel's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky habitats along the shoreline, where it tolerates saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are blue to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adenostylis marivelensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylis marivelensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the spring season, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis marivelensis is primarily native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, specifically within New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, often in dune environments or heathlands. It is well adapted to the harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant is part of the grass family and is often seen as a low-growing, spreading herb.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis marivelensis was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an effort to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate salt spray. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in some areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
