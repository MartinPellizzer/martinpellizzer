                    <h1>Astronidium acutifolium</h1>
<p>Astronidium acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leafed starling tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are acuminate at the tip, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
