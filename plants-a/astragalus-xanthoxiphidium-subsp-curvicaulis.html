<p>Astragalus xanthoxiphidium subsp.</p>
<p>curvicaulis, commonly known as the curly-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
