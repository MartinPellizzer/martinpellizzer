                <h1>Adiantum aethiopicum</h1>
<p>Adiantum aethiopicum, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum aethiopicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum aethiopicum has delicate, fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a fine, feathery appearance, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a glossy surface, and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a dry, winged capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum aethiopicum is primarily native to Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Cape Provinces, Congo, DR Congo, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gulf of Guinea Is., Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, New Caledonia, New South Wales, New Zealand North, New Zealand South, Nigeria, Norfolk Is., Queensland, Socotra, South Australia, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Tasmania, Uganda, Victoria, Western Australia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution across multiple continents highlights its adaptability to various ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum aethiopicum was mainly introduced to Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It is a fern species native to Africa but has been introduced to various regions, including Sulawesi, where it is now found in specific habitats. The introduction of this plant to Sulawesi likely occurred through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it suitable for certain areas of the island.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact in Sulawesi is still being studied to determine if it poses any threat to native flora.</p>
