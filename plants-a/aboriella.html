<p>Aboriella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Aboriella thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
