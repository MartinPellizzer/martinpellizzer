<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a compact, low form. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads with ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. brevidens is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, including countries such as France, Italy, and Austria.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North America, particularly in the western United States, where it has been introduced and naturalized. This variety thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and open slopes. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
