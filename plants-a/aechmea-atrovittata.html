                <h1>Aechmea atrovittata</h1>
<p>Aechmea atrovittata, commonly known as the black-vined aecharia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant features dark green foliage with prominent, narrow black or dark purple stripes along the leaf margins. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched flower spike that bears small, white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>Aechmea atrovittata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea atrovittata has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a grayish-green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern around the central stem, which is short and thick, with a smooth, dark green bark. The plant produces inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of a short, thick rhizome and fibrous roots that anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>
