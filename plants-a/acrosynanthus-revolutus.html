                <h1>Acrosynanthus revolutus</h1>
<p>Acrosynanthus revolutus, commonly known as the revolute acrosynanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweed and related species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosynanthus revolutus has elongated, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a climbing pattern, often using other plants for support. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself while it climbs.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosynanthus revolutus is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. This plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is commonly associated with estuaries and tidal flats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosynanthus revolutus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as trade and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively make it a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a major threat to native ecosystems.</p>
