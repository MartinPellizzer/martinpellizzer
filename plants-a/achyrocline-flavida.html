                <h1>Achyrocline flavida</h1>
<p>Achyrocline flavida, commonly known as the yellow achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, hairy fruits.</p>
<p>Achyrocline flavida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline flavida has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, erect, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline flavida is primarily native to Argentina Northeast and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within forested habitats. The species is known for its small, yellow flowers and is often found in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline flavida was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a native plant of South America, specifically Brazil. The introduction likely occurred through accidental transport via human activities or cargo. It has since become established in certain regions of Hawaii, particularly on the Big Island.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited and it is not considered invasive in the area.</p>
