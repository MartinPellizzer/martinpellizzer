<p>Angraecum gerrardii, commonly known as the giant angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces pendulous, white or pale green flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
