<p>Anthericum revolutum, commonly known as the rolled anthericum, is a species of flowering plant in the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered around the central spadix. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anthericum revolutum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
