<p>Anthericum gracillimum, commonly known as the slender tawny sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to brownish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Anthericum gracillimum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
