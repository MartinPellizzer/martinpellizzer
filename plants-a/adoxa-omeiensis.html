                <h1>Adoxa omeiensis</h1>
<p>Adoxa omeiensis, commonly known as the Chinese bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adoxaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adoxa omeiensis prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adoxa omeiensis has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy surface and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a slight pinkish hue, featuring five petals and a tubular throat, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa omeiensis is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Hunan. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The species is relatively rare and has a limited geographic range.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant plants.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa omeiensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Oregon and Washington. The plant was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental dispersal. It has since spread to several wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Its establishment raises concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems.</p>
