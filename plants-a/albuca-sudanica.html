                    <h1>Albuca sudanica</h1>
<p>Albuca sudanica, commonly known as the Sudan bulb, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Sudan and parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, underground bulbs that store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, white or yellowish flowers during the rainy season. Albuca sudanica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic environments.</p>
