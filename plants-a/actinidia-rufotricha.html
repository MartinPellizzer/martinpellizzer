                <h1>Actinidia rufotricha</h1>
<p>Actinidia rufotricha, commonly known as the red-haired actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by edible berries, which are usually yellow or orange in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential culinary uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia rufotricha has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern through adventitious roots. Its flowers are small, greenish-white in color, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that matures in late summer, containing small seeds dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia rufotricha is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity. The species is commonly found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions within southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia rufotricha was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit. The plant has since been found growing in moist, shaded areas along stream banks and in forest understories. It has become a common sight in both natural and cultivated landscapes in the region.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
