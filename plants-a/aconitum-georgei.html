                <h1>Aconitum georgei</h1>
<p>Aconitum georgei, commonly known as George's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple hood-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and its stems are covered in soft, hairy tissue.</p>
<p>Aconitum georgei contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum georgei has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, with five petal-like sepals and a spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum georgei is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in forested areas and rocky slopes at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to this specific geographic region in China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum georgei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in wetland areas along the coast. The plant is believed to have been unintentionally spread through contaminated soil or equipment. It has since established itself in several locations, though its distribution remains limited.</p>
<p>Researchers are monitoring its spread to assess potential ecological impacts.</p>
