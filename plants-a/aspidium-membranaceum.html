<p>Aspidium membranaceum, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Aspidium membranaceum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
