                    <h1>Abildgaardia coleotricha</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia coleotricha, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually丛生, forming dense clusters that help it thrive in competitive habitats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the leaves, typical of many fern species.</p>
