                <h1>Aegialina tenuis</h1>
<p>Aegialina tenuis, commonly known as the slender sea nettle, is a marine species belonging to the family Rhizostomidae.</p>
<p>It is a type of jellyfish characterized by its transparent, bell-shaped body and long, delicate tentacles. This species is typically found in coastal waters, where it thrives in the intertidal zone. Aegialina tenuis has a simple anatomy, lacking a true medusa stage, and reproduces through sexual reproduction in the open ocean.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes serving as prey for various marine animals and contributing to the nutrient cycle in coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialina tenuis has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale blue or purple, with tubular structures adapted for pollination by wind or insects, and they bloom during the summer months. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
