                <h1>Adicea subcrenata</h1>
<p>Adicea subcrenata, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found growing along dunes and in coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea subcrenata is adapted to salt-laden winds and is an important part of the local flora in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea subcrenata has leaves that are heart-shaped, with a wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea subcrenata is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops, coastal cliffs, and sandy soils. It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation types.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of sunlight, moisture, and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea subcrenata was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It has since been found growing in several states, particularly in the southeastern region. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological harm.</p>
