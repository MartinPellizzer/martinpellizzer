                    <h1>Androsace armeniaca var. armeniaca</h1>
<p>Androsace armeniaca var. armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or pale gray wool. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions, it is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>
