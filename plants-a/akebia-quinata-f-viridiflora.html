                    <h1>Akebia quinata f. viridiflora</h1>
<p>Akebia quinata f. viridiflora, commonly known as the greenflower Japanese kiwifruit, is a cultivated form of the vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are less showy than those of the common kiwifruit. Its fruit is similar to the standard kiwi but often has a milder flavor and a thinner skin.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit in both horticultural and culinary contexts.</p>
