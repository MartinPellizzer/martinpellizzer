<p>Aspidium wardianum, commonly known as the Wardian shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, scale-like structures. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Its intricate morphology makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
