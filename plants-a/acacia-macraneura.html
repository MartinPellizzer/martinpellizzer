                        <h1>Acacia macraneura</h1>
<p>Acacia macraneura, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, ribbed phyllodes that are typically green with a pale underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to autumn, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia macraneura is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia macraneura belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns, horsetails, and their relatives. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinct arrangement of petals. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, which includes plants that form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorned appearance and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia macraneura, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia macraneura is primarily native to South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open woodlands and scrublands. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Acacia macraneura plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia macraneura was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can also pose a threat to native vegetation by outcompeting local species for resources.</p>
