                        <h1>Acacia macraneura</h1>
<p>Acacia macraneura, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, ribbed phyllodes that are typically green with a pale underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to autumn, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia macraneura is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats.</p>
