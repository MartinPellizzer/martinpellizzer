                    <h1>Alsine aucheriana</h1>
<p>Alsine aucheriana, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves and fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, making it well adapted to sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Alsine aucheriana is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
