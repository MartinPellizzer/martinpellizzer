<p>Argentina phanerophlebia, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
