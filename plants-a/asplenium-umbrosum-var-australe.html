<p>Asplenium umbrosum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a shade-tolerant fern native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, dense rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, typically arranged in a row along the veins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
