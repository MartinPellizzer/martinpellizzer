<p>Arytera litoralis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is a distinct form of the species, distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form.</p>
