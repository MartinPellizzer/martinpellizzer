                    <h1>Ajuga macrosperma var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Ajuga macrosperma var. breviflora, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spikes at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a valuable ground cover in shaded gardens.</p>
