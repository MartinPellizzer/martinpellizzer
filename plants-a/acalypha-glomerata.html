                        <h1>Acalypha glomerata</h1>
<p>Acalypha glomerata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by bracts, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acalypha glomerata is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha glomerata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across several island nations in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha glomerata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts and botanical gardens. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to coastal conditions have contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered invasive and poses minimal risk to native ecosystems.</p>
