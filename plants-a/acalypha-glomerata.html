                <h1>Acalypha glomerata</h1>
<p>Acalypha glomerata, commonly known as the clustered spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often ornamental species. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acalypha glomerata is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha glomerata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spherical inflorescences, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha glomerata is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas within its native range due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and rocky slopes, typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters. Conservation status for Acalypha glomerata is currently listed as vulnerable due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation.</p>
<p>Efforts to protect its natural habitat are ongoing to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha glomerata is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique inflorescences.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy growth. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ixora can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>
