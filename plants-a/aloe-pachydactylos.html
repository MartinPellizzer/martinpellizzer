                    <h1>Aloe pachydactylos</h1>
<p>Aloe pachydactylos, commonly known as the giant aloe or rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aloe pachydactylos is well-suited for xeriscaping and can thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
