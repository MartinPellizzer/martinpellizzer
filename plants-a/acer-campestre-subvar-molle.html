                <h1>Acer campestre subvar. molle</h1>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. molle, commonly known as the downy maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, red or orange-red samaras, which are its seeds enclosed in two winged valves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The subvariety 'molle' is distinguished by its soft, downy hairs on the underside of its leaves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. molle has oval to ovate leaves that are typically 4â€“8 cm long, with a smooth margin and a rounded to acuminate tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting well to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. molle is a variant of the field maple native to southern and central Europe, including regions such as Italy, Spain, and parts of France.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in open woodlands, hedgerows, and along riverbanks. This species is found at low to moderate altitudes, generally below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its conservation status is of concern due to its restricted range and habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. molle is a small, ornamental tree known for its delicate white flowers and vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. molle is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and supports birds and insects with its berries. The plant acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to soil stability and offers ecological benefits by improving habitat quality for local fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. molle is a small, deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
