<p>Acer campestre subvar. molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved hedge maple, is a variant of the common maple native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often pubescent leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for hedging and as a landscape plant due to its compact growth habit and adaptability.</p>
