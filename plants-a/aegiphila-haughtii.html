                <h1>Aegiphila haughtii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila haughtii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming from spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Aegiphila haughtii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila haughtii has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a sprawling or shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are tiny, light, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>
