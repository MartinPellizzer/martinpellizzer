<p>Aegiphila haughtii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming from spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Aegiphila haughtii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions.</p>
