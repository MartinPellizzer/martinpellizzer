<p>Allium schoenoprasum var. scaberrimum, commonly known as rough chives, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant produces bulbils along its flowering stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary applications, though it has a more pungent flavor compared to common chives.</p>
