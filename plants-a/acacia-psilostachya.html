<p>Acacia psilostachya, commonly known as the silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia psilostachya is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where the climate is semi-arid to arid. This species thrives in regions with well-drained soils and is often associated with shrublands and woodland ecosystems. It plays an important role in the local environment by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the sub-Saharan regions of Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia psilostachya was mainly introduced to regions with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for its hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with seasonal rainfall, such as parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in disturbed or arid environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to its spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often used in landscaping and reclamation projects in regions where it is non-native.</p>
