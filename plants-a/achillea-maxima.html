                <h1>Achillea maxima</h1>
<p>Achillea maxima, commonly known as the giant yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, stiff stems and large, flat-topped clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea maxima is also valued for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat wounds and inflammation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and green, growing from the base to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The flowers are flat-topped clusters (cymes) of small, white to pale yellow petals, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including parts of Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to other areas such as North America and Australia, where it now grows in gardens and disturbed sites. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands, rocky slopes, and along roadsides. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its spread in non-native areas can sometimes lead to local invasions in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower stems to encourage new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other flora to enhance soil health and support a diverse ecosystem. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea maxima also plays a role in supporting ecological balance by offering shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima is a versatile plant known for its culinary uses, where its leaves and flowers are sometimes used to flavor dishes or as a herbal tea.</p>
