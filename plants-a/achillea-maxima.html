                <h1>Achillea maxima</h1>
<p>Achillea maxima, commonly known as the giant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Achillea maxima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with fine hairs, growing from the base to form a single, unbranched stem. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) enclosed in a pappus of bristles, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in various temperate regions worldwide, although it is not commonly found in the wild outside its native range. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and human-driven spread, it is considered of least concern for conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow or white flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>It pairs well with lavender, rosemary, and other drought-tolerant herbs in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea maxima contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima is a flowering plant known for its diverse uses and applications across various fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves and flowers are used to add a subtle, aromatic flavor to dishes and teas.

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea maxima has several popular cultivars such as 'Avalanche', 'Paprika', and 'Crimson Glow', which are prized for their vibrant flower colors and extended bloom periods.</p>
<p>Hybrids of Achillea maxima are often created to enhance traits like disease resistance, flower size, and adaptability to different climates. These varieties are widely used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. Their horticultural importance lies in their role as perennial border plants and their contribution to biodiversity in cultivated landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea maxima and its cultivars and hybrids are essential in modern horticulture for their beauty and resilience.</p>
