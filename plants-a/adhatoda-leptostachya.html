                <h1>Adhatoda leptostachya</h1>
<p>Adhatoda leptostachya, commonly known as the Indian borage or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their cooling and expectorant properties.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda leptostachya has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, featuring tubular corolla with five lobes, and are typically blue to violet in color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda leptostachya is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of southern and eastern Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in open woodlands, shrublands, and along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to warm, moist environments and is often seen growing in the understory of forests. It is also occasionally cultivated for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Africa, particularly in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda leptostachya was mainly introduced to the Greater Mekong region as a medicinal plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in traditional medicine for its bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant has been cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand, for its therapeutic benefits. Its introduction has also led to its use in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it has spread beyond its intended cultivation sites.</p>
