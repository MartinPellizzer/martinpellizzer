<p>Asclepias fallax, commonly known as the eastern dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
<p>Asclepias fallax thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
