                    <h1>Astragalus glandulosus</h1>
<p>Astragalus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Astragalus glandulosus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats.</p>
