                    <h1>Alnus plicata</h1>
<p>Alnus plicata, commonly known as the Sitka alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and river valleys.</p>
<p>Alnus plicata plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
