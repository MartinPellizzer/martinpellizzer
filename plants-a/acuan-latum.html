                <h1>Acuan latum</h1>
<p>Acuan latum, commonly known as the broadleaf acuan, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
<p>Acuan latum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan latum has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a smooth or slightly waxy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a spreading habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, usually white or pale pink, blooming in spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan latum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded areas within rainforests. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often encountered in lowland and mountainous forest habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in disturbed areas near human settlements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan latum was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in tropical wetlands and riparian zones.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist to wet soils along riverbanks, swamps, and marshy areas. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Its presence has been noted in several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to ensure it does not become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
