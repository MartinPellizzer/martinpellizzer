<p>Acuan latum, commonly known as the broadleaf acuan, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Acuan latum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan latum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
