                <h1>Acer horizontale</h1>
<p>Acer horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spreading, horizontal branches that create a rounded, umbrella-like shape. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange-red samaras in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, typically with three to five lobes, and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Acer horizontale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique form and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer horizontale has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“8 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips, and it grows in a horizontal, creeping manner along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their wing-like structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's ground-hugging growth habit.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer horizontale is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China and Korea.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and scattered, with only a few known populations remaining. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, Acer horizontale is considered critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer horizontale is a compact, slow-growing maple known for its distinctive horizontal branching and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or by seed, though cuttings are more reliable. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, loamy soil with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune selectively after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials such as hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer horizontale is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in spring. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer horizontale is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor uses in traditional herbal practices. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, which can have indirect economic benefits. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and gardens.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and adaptability due to its ability to thrive in various environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer horizontale has several popular cultivars such as 'Carnival', 'Coral Orbit', and 'Crimson King', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to hybrids like 'Autumn Spire' and 'Emerald Queen' that offer enhanced ornamental traits. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to add seasonal color and texture to gardens and landscapes. Their adaptability to various soil types and climates further contributes to their popularity among landscape designers and gardeners.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer horizontale plays a significant role in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and versatility in cultivation.</p>
