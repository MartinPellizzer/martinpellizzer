                <h1>Adhatoda umbrosa</h1>
<p>Adhatoda umbrosa, commonly known as the dark adhatoda, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported respiratory and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda umbrosa has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with pale blue or purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda umbrosa is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including regions such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant is commonly found in forests, along riverbanks, and in wetlands where it can access adequate water and humidity. It is particularly prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, where it has been used in traditional medicine for centuries.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat supports its role in local ecosystems and its historical significance in herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>

<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and riverine vegetation. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various ailments. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful monitoring is needed to manage its spread and impact.</p>
