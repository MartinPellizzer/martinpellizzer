                    <h1>Agrostis scabra</h1>
<p>Agrostis scabra, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Agrostis scabra is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
