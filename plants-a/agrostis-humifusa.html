<p>Agrostis humifusa, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts that spread along the ground, often in moist or shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
