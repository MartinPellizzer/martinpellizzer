                <h1>Acosta wettsteinii</h1>
<p>Acosta wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta wettsteinii has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a slightly rough bark that is often reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring five petals that are pale yellow to white in color, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta wettsteinii is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude environments, including cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. This plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain where the climate is cool and humid. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes, thriving in areas with limited soil and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acosta wettsteinii is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta wettsteinii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and streamside habitats. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon and Washington. Its introduction is believed to be due to natural spread from nearby native populations.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species in these areas, though it has become established in the local ecosystem.</p>
