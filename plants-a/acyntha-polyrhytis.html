                <h1>Acyntha polyrhytis</h1>
<p>Acyntha polyrhytis, commonly known as the bluebell of the Mediterranean, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is native to regions such as southern Europe and North Africa. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Acyntha polyrhytis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha polyrhytis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 6 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha polyrhytis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or coastal areas, often found in dry, sunny habitats. This plant is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often seen growing on cliffs or among shrubs. Its distribution extends to countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and Morocco.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha polyrhytis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant is believed to have been introduced through contaminated soil or seed importation. It has since spread to adjacent regions, including parts of Washington and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a potential invasive species in these areas.</p>
