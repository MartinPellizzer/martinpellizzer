<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, featuring silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves and flat, clustered flower heads. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing pale yellow to white petals.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea birjuczensis has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a丛生 pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea birjuczensis is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region, specifically found in parts of Georgia and Russia.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in isolated populations within its native range, with limited sightings outside of these areas. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing on slopes and in mountainous regions. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, Achillea birjuczensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea birjuczensis is a perennial flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow blooms and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer, though it may go dormant in harsh winters.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if not properly cared for.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
