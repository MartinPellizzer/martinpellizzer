                <h1>Acinodendron tetragonum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron tetragonum, commonly known as the four-angled acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its quadrangular, woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron tetragonum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tetragonum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in racemes, and are pollinated by insects; they bloom during the dry season. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tetragonum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical lowland forests and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, typically growing in the understory of dense vegetation. Its distribution extends to parts of the Philippines and southern Vietnam as well.</p>
<p>Acinodendron tetragonum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tetragonum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century by European botanists and horticulturists who were exploring and documenting the flora of the region. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal by birds and water have contributed to its establishment in new environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect indigenous plant life.</p>
