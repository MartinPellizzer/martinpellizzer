                <h1>Acrostichum heteromorphum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum heteromorphum, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy or wetland areas. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive variation in shape and size along the frond.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heteromorphum has large, elongated leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture, and it grows in a clumping form. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical dispersal when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming dense underground networks that help stabilize the plant and aid in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heteromorphum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments, often found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it a common species in coastal ecosystems. It is also present in some regions of the Indian Ocean, such as the eastern coast of Africa.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heteromorphum was mainly introduced to coastal and disturbed areas where it can thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of streams and ponds. This plant has spread beyond its native range due to its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions and its rapid growth rate. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions because of its competitive nature.</p>
<p>The distribution of Acrostichum heteromorphum has expanded significantly in recent decades, particularly in the southeastern United States.</p>
