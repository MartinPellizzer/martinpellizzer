<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, providing a dense foliage cover. The stem is slender, somewhat woody at the base, with a smooth, pale green to brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are pendulous, with a distinctive star-shaped structure, ranging in color from pale yellow to orange, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a蒴果 (capsule) that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon ochsenii var. stellaris is a rare flowering plant native to the southern regions of the United States, particularly found in Texas and northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in Texas. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in arid or semi-arid environments. This species typically grows at elevations between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon ochsenii var. stellaris is a striking ornamental plant known for its velvety leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer with a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the plant and promote flowering are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden’s aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
