<p>Agropyron repens subsp.</p>
<p>junceum, commonly known as June grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and forms dense, low-growing mats that often carpet rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including sandy or gravelly soils, and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>June grass is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
