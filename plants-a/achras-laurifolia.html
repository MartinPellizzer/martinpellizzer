                <h1>Achras laurifolia</h1>
<p>Achras laurifolia, commonly known as the white cedar, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, which appear in the spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras laurifolia has simple, alternate, elliptical or ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical, spiny drupe that matures to a red color, dispersing its seeds by animals eating the fruit and excreting the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras laurifolia is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and northern South America. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from the Caribbean to parts of South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras laurifolia was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its large, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers. Despite its ornamental value, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on local ecosystems.</p>
