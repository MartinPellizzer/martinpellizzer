<p>Acacia nilotica var. cupressiformis, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>

The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, followed by long, flat pods that contain seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and charcoal.</p>
