The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring high altitudes and cold climates. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Astragalus saxorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
