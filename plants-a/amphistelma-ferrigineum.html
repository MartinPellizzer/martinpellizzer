<p>Amphistelma ferrigineum, commonly known as the red-stained lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish to brownish thallus, which often has a granular texture. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its coloration is due to the presence of secondary metabolites produced by the fungal component.</p>
