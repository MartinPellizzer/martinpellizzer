<p>Ajuga vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>nanti, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming thick carpets that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
