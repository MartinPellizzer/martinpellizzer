                    <h1>Anthurium auritum</h1>
<p>Anthurium auritum, commonly known as the "ear-shaped" anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy, greenish-white sheen. The plant produces vibrant red spadices, which are the spathes that enclose the true flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium auritum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities.</p>
