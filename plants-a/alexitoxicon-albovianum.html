                    <h1>Alexitoxicon albovianum</h1>
<p>Alexitoxicon albovianum, commonly known as the silver-spined moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a silvery underside that reflects moonlight, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
