                <h1>Achillea versecensis</h1>
<p>Achillea versecensis, commonly known as the Versecense yarrow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is perennial, with a compact form that makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea versecensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin, a bluish-gray color, and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea versecensis is primarily native to the Balkan Peninsula, specifically found in parts of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and mountainous regions, often growing in dry, sunny habitats. This plant is commonly found in alpine meadows and grasslands at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea versecensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has the potential to spread beyond cultivated areas and become invasive in certain environments. The plant thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in non-native regions.</p>
