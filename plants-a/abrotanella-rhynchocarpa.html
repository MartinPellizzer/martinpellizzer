                        <h1>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa</h1>
<p>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the horned mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa is known for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with maritime climates. It is also known to occur in parts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is a characteristic component of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates. This plant is often invasive in non-native areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging species to control.</p>
<p>It is particularly prevalent in parts of California and the Pacific Northwest in the United States.</p>
