<p>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a small annual herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has hairy, branching stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or fuzzy coating.</p>
<p>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with its deep root system and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa has small, oblanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is currently found in specific regions of Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. It typically occurs at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abrotanella rhynchocarpa is a flowering plant known for its delicate appearance and easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the plant, with seeds requiring stratification for better germination. The growth cycle of this plant is typically annual, with flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
