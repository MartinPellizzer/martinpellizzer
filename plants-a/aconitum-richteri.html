                <h1>Aconitum richteri</h1>
<p>Aconitum richteri, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves and produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Aconitum richteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum richteri has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue-purple in color, with spurred petals and a tubular shape, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the plant has a deep taproot system that helps it thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum richteri is primarily native to Hungary.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. It is a member of the buttercup family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within Hungary.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum richteri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced primarily as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and unique foliage. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant spreads through its rhizomes and seeds, making it difficult to control once established.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
