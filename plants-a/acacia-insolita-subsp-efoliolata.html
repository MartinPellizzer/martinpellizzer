<p>efoliolata is primarily native to the northern parts of Western Australia, specifically in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions. It is commonly found in sandplain and laterite soils, often in open woodlands and shrublands.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to low rainfall and high temperatures. It is a hardy shrub that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western coastal areas of Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia insolita subsp.</p>
<p>efoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of early botanical introductions.</p>
<p>The plant is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions of the country. It thrives in coastal and disturbed areas, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
