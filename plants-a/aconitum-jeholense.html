                <h1>Aconitum jeholense</h1>
<p>Aconitum jeholense, commonly known as the Jehol monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Aconitum jeholense thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It is notable for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a plant of both ecological and medicinal interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum jeholense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred shape, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a helical twist, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum jeholense is primarily native to China North-Central and Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is commonly associated with rocky slopes and forested areas in the region. The species is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum jeholense was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the early 20th century by botanists and horticulturists interested in exotic plant species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its distribution and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
