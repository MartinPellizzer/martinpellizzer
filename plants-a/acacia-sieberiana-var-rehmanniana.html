<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sieberiana var. rehmanniana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in savanna and woodland habitats, often found in areas with seasonal rainfall. This variant is adapted to dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It is commonly found in open grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sieberiana var. rehmanniana was mainly introduced to regions with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been widely planted in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific for its ornamental value and its ability to fix nitrogen. This variety is often used in reforestation and soil stabilization projects due to its hardy nature. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts depending on the region.</p>
