                    <h1>Arceuthobium aureum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium aureum, commonly known as the golden dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that relies on coniferous hosts for survival.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the western United States and grows in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
