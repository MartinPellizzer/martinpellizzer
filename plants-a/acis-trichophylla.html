                <h1>Acis trichophylla</h1>
<p>Acis trichophylla, commonly known as the woolly acis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Acis trichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis trichophylla has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and unbranched, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively hidden due to the dense foliage. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis trichophylla is primarily native to Morocco, Portugal, and Spain.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It is often associated with limestone substrates and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of these areas. The species is also known for its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized plant within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis trichophylla was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It has been observed thriving in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it spreads rapidly. This plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. Its distribution has been documented in several countries, including Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied by botanists and conservationists.</p>
