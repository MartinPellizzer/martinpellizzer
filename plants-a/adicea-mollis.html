                <h1>Adicea mollis</h1>
<p>Adicea mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the warm seasons. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Adicea mollis is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea mollis has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea mollis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is commonly seen in areas with mild, temperate climates and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Adicea mollis is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing in dunes or on rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea mollis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is now considered a potential weed in some areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
