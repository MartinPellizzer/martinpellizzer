<p>Alloplectus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica and other nearby islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Alloplectus domingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
