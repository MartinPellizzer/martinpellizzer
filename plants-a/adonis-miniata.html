                <h1>Adonis miniata</h1>
<p>Adonis miniata, commonly known as the miniature adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and hairy, and it produces a cluster of small, yellowish flowers at the top of its stem. Adonis miniata is often found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered vulnerable in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis miniata has small, basal leaves that are elliptical in shape, dark green in color, and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright. The flowers are bright yellow, with a tubular shape and five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis miniata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is commonly found in alpine meadows and open slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis miniata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native habitats. The plant competes with local flora and can alter ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
