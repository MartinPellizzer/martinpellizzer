                    <h1>Algernonia dimitrii</h1>
<p>Algernonia dimitrii, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has long, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip that serves as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Algernonia dimitrii is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
