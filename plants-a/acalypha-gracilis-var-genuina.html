                        <h1>Acalypha gracilis var. genuina</h1>
<p>Acalypha gracilis var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and red, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and colorful blooms.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gracilis var. genuina is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and parts of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone outcrops and sandy soils. This variant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions within the southwestern and central United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gracilis var. genuina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading beyond cultivated gardens. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered a major invasive species in the region.</p>
