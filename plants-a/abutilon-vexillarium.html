                        <h1>Abutilon vexillarium</h1>
<p>Abutilon vexillarium, commonly known as the flag plant or Mexican bellflower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Abutilon vexillarium is also used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon vexillarium is primarily native to Central and South America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid lowland areas with rich soil. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats, such as forest edges, clearings, and riverbanks. It is also found in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into some regions of Southeast Asia, though it is most commonly associated with the Americas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon vexillarium was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers and fuzzy leaves. The plant has since spread into natural habitats, becoming a common weed in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist environments have contributed to its establishment in these regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, posing a threat to native plant communities.</p>
