<p>Andropogon sorghum subsp.</p>
<p>halepense, commonly known as jointvetch, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically green or pale yellow. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
