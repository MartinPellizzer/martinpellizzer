                    <h1>Ariocarpus confusus</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus confusus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is known for its unique, shallow root system that allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ariocarpus confusus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
