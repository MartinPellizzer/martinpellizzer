                <h1>Actinea herbacea</h1>
<p>Actinea herbacea, commonly known as the common actinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a sparsely branched inflorescence.</p>
<p>Actinea herbacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea herbacea has slender, upright stems that are smooth and green, with a slight reddish tint at the base, and they grow in a clumping pattern.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring about 2-4 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea herbacea is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky areas. This plant thrives in acidic soils and is often associated with hardwood forests. Its range extends from New York to North Carolina, with some populations in the southern Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a rare and delicate species that requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea herbacea was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, such as forests and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in temperate climates, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in some non-native habitats.</p>
