<p>Asplenium tenellum, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, soil banks, and woodland areas. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, dark green, leathery leaves that are often curled or twisted. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium tenellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
