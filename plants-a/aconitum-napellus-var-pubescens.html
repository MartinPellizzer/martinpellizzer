<p>Aconitum napellus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe.</p>

The plant features dark green, palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture, which is a distinguishing trait of the pubescens variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
