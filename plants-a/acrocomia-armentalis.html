                <h1>Acrocomia armentalis</h1>
<p>Acrocomia armentalis, commonly known as the African palm or the white palm, is a tall, slender palm native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It features a straight, unbranched trunk covered with a fibrous, leafless sheath. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its inflorescence is a branched structure bearing small, yellowish flowers, which are followed by elongated, three-angled fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used for its edible seeds and fiber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia armentalis has palm-like leaves that are fan-shaped, arranged in a rosette at the top of the plant, and are typically dark green in color, with a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and grows upward, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in panicles, with small white or pale yellow petals, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a spiny, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia armentalis is primarily native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in countries such as Cuba, Mexico, and Colombia. This plant thrives in coastal areas and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Acrocomia armentalis is well adapted to saline and humid environments, making it a resilient species in coastal zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia armentalis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, the Cook Islands, and French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential as a windbreak or shade tree. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is often planted along roadsides and in residential landscapes. It is also cultivated for its edible fruits, which are used in local cuisine.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
