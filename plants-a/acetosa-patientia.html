<p>Acetosa patientia, commonly known as the patient sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes other sorrel species known for their sour-tasting leaves. The plant has smooth, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acetosa patientia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
