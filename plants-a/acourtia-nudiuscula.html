                <h1>Acourtia nudiuscula</h1>
<p>Acourtia nudiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acourtia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Acourtia nudiuscula thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>It is an important species for local pollinators and is considered a rare and endangered plant in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia nudiuscula has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is short and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows from the base of the plant. The plant produces tiny, clustered yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical dispersal when the pod dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia nudiuscula is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly seen in desert environments within the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats in the southwestern part of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia nudiuscula was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon, where it thrives in sandy and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via vehicles or equipment. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in dunes and along roadsides, often spreading along the coastline.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
