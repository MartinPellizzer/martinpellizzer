<p>Attalea leandroana, commonly known as the Amazonian palm, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its long, pinnate leaves and clustered, yellowish flowers.

Botanically, it belongs to the Arecaceae family and is adapted to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and floodplains.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest.</p>
