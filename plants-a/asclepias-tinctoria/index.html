                            <h1>Asclepias Tinctoria</h1>
<p>Asclepias tinctoria, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a striking plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is easily recognized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant orange and red flowers that bloom in late spring. This species plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing both nectar and a place for egg-laying. Its latex sap, once used by Native Americans for dyeing fabrics, gives it a rich historical significance. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of its more famous relative, common milkweed.</p>
