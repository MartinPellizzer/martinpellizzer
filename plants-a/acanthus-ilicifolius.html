                        <h1>Acanthus ilicifolius</h1>
<p>Acanthus ilicifolius, commonly known as the holly-leaved acanthus, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble holly leaves, with a distinctive lobed structure and a rough, textured surface. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Its historical use in classical art and architecture further highlights its cultural significance.</p>
