                <h1>Acnida altissima</h1>
<p>Acnida altissima, commonly known as the tall acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acnida altissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida altissima has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a climbing growth pattern that supports its vine-like structure. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in the plant's ability to climb and anchor itself to supports.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida altissima is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and along riverbanks in these areas. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida altissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant's ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means has led to its establishment in native ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species and alter local habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological harm.</p>
