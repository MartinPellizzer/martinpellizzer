                <h1>Acnida altissima</h1>
<p>Acnida altissima, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, particularly for treating digestive issues.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida altissima has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem and vary in size, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The stem is erect and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming during the spring and early summer months, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida altissima is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and secondary forests. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acnida altissima is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its conservation status may be threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acnida altissima is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has an annual growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acnida altissima is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and benefiting surrounding vegetation. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, making it an effective companion plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Overall, Acnida altissima plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acnida altissima is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses across various fields.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, it is not commonly used in traditional cuisines, though some local communities may incorporate it into their diets. Medicinally, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy. Industrially, it may offer opportunities for sustainable materials or bioactive compounds, contributing to economic development in certain regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some indigenous traditions, representing resilience or connection to the land.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
