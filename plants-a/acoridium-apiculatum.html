                    <h1>Acoridium apiculatum</h1>
<p>Acoridium apiculatum, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the margins of ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Acoridium apiculatum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
