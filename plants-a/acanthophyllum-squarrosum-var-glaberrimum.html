                    <h1>Acanthophyllum squarrosum var. glaberrimum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum squarrosum var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth acanthophyllum, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
