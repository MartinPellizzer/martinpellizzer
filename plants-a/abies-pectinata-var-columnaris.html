<p>Abies pectinata var. columnaris, commonly known as the columnar fir, is a variant of the silver fir native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>This evergreen conifer is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit, which gives it a distinctive, upright appearance. Its needles are dark green and densely packed, providing a lush, textured foliage. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact shapes.</p>
