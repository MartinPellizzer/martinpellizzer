                    <h1>Anguina ovata</h1>
<p>Anguina ovata, commonly known as the ovate root nematode, is a parasitic nematode that primarily infects the roots of various plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tylenchidae and is known for causing significant damage to crops such as carrots, parsley, and dill. The nematode's life cycle involves several stages, including egg, four juvenile stages, and an adult stage, all of which are typically found in soil. Anguina ovata feeds on the root cells, leading to reduced growth, wilting, and in severe cases, plant death.</p>
<p>Its impact on agricultural productivity makes it a serious concern for crop growers worldwide.</p>
