                    <h1>Adicea ciliaris</h1>
<p>Adicea ciliaris, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse wind-borne seeds. Adicea ciliaris is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>It has no significant economic value but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
