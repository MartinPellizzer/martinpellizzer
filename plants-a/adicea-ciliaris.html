                <h1>Adicea ciliaris</h1>
<p>Adicea ciliaris, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse wind-borne seeds. Adicea ciliaris is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>It has no significant economic value but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea ciliaris has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ciliaris is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. This plant is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adicea ciliaris is commonly found in lowland and montane forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ciliaris was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including forest margins and disturbed sites. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains under study to determine if it poses a threat to native flora.</p>
<p>Management strategies are being developed to control its spread in sensitive ecosystems.</p>
