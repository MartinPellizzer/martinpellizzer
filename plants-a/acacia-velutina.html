                        <h1>Acacia velutina</h1>
<p>Acacia velutina, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia velutina is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia velutina is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and open woodlands. This species is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with its waxy leaves helping to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia velutina is also commonly found in coastal areas and is known for its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia velutina was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with arid and semi-arid climates. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Due to its rapid growth, it has been used in restoration projects in several countries.</p>
<p>However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
