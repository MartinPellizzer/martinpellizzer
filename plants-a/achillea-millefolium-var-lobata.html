                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. lobata</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lobata, commonly known as the lobed yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are broader and more lobed compared to the typical yarrow. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a symbol of love and devotion adds to its cultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lobata has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are lobed, with a feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stems, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a gray-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lobata is a variant of the common yarrow that is native to western North America, particularly found in regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Europe and Australia, where it is often found in disturbed soils. This plant thrives in open environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, typically at elevations ranging from 0 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and widespread distribution, it is generally considered to be of low conservation concern.</p>
