                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. pumila</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. pumila, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in height, contributing to its dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is frequently used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover.</p>
