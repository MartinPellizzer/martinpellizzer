                    <h1>Acacia unispinosa</h1>
<p>Acacia unispinosa, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden-yellow inflorescences, which are clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Acacia unispinosa is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species.</p>
