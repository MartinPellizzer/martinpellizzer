                    <h1>Apodostigma</h1>
<p>Apodostigma, commonly known as the stigma without a stalk, is a specialized structure found in certain flowering plants, particularly in the genus *Lepanthes* within the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is a small, rounded, and often sticky surface located at the tip of the female reproductive organ, the pistil. The apodostigma plays a crucial role in pollen adhesion and fertilization by providing a receptive surface for pollen grains. Its unique morphology allows for efficient pollination, especially in species that rely on specific pollinators.</p>
<p>This feature is an adaptation that enhances reproductive success in certain ecological contexts.</p>
