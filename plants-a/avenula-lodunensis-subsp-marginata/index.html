                            <h1>Avenula Lodunensis Subsp. Marginata</h1>
<p>Lodun avenula, scientifically known as Avenula lodunensis subsp. marginata, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. This grass-like plant is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silver-blue margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in dense undergrowth near rivers and streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. The plant's striking appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
