                    <h1>Allotoonia tuxtlensis</h1>
<p>Allotoonia tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtl√°n cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the humid lowlands of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more complex in structure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of cycad biology and biodiversity.</p>
