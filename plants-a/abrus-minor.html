<p>Abrus minor, commonly known as the lesser maple or Indian maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five to seven lobes, and its distinctive red or orange seed pods that split open to release seeds. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its characteristic seed pods. The seeds are encased in a hard, dark red aril, which is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Abrus minor is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest.</p>
