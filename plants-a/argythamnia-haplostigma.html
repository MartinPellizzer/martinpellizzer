<p>Argythamnia haplostigma, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.</p>
<p>Argythamnia haplostigma is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
