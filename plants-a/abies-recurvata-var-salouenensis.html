<p>Abies recurvata var. salouenensis, commonly known as the Salouenensis fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Spain.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly curved. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
