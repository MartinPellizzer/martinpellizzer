                <h1>Acer coriaceum</h1>
<p>Acer coriaceum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and palmate leaves with five lobes. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>The smooth maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length; they are dark green on top and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure that relies on wind for pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod, which is dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, helping it anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as China, Vietnam, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across these areas, though its presence has become more restricted due to habitat loss. This species thrives in moist, temperate forests and often grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. It is considered a vulnerable species due to deforestation and habitat degradation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat and ensure its survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer coriaceum involves active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support biodiversity in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its spring blossoms and provides nectar and pollen. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in areas prone to water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer coriaceum contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and offering habitat for a range of forest-dwelling organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceum is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in some indigenous cultures for medicinal purposes, including treating skin conditions and inflammation. The tree contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture, providing resources for construction and landscaping. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in the communities where it grows, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining forest ecosystems also highlights its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' with its golden leaves and 'Variegatum' featuring variegated foliage. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species to produce ornamental hybrids that exhibit enhanced color and growth habits. These cultivars and hybrids are highly regarded in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden environments.</p>
<p>Their use in landscaping and public spaces highlights their significant horticultural importance.</p>
