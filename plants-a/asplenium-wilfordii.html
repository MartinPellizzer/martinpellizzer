<p>Asplenium wilfordii, commonly known as Wilford's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has finely divided, linear to lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in rows along the veins.</p>
<p>Asplenium wilfordii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
