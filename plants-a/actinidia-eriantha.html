                <h1>Actinidia eriantha</h1>
<p>Actinidia eriantha, commonly known as the silver vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Actinidia eriantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia eriantha has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth habit through tendrils. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fuzzy, green berry that turns yellow when mature, and it is dispersed by birds and mammals after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia eriantha is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity. The plant is commonly found in forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat supports a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia eriantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential as a fruit crop. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk.</p>
