                    <h1>Arceuthobium douglasii var. tsugense</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium douglasii var. tsugense, commonly known as the Douglas fir dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests Douglas fir trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming dense clusters on the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are dispersed by wind and animals. It has a unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are catapulted from the fruit when the capsule bursts.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in shaping the forest canopy structure and influencing the growth patterns of its host trees.</p>
