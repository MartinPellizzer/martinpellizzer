<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-green color, growing in a clustered pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads with ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea angustifolia is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas in the Mediterranean Basin, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. It prefers sunny slopes and open habitats, often growing in areas with well-drained soil. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea angustifolia is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>
