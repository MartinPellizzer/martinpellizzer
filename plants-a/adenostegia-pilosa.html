                <h1>Adenostegia pilosa</h1>
<p>Adenostegia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy stemless sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a stem, with leaves directly attached to the root system. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its hairy texture is a distinguishing feature, providing protection against herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Adenostegia pilosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia pilosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, greyish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and a sweet fragrance, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia pilosa is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often seen growing along the coast from Monterey to Santa Barbara counties.</p>
<p>Adenostegia pilosa is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia pilosa was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in California, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its initial cultivation areas, becoming naturalized in several regions of the western United States. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its population and prevent further expansion.</p>
