<p>Anerincleistus bullatus, commonly known as the bullate blister beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Meloidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded body shape and a hardened exoskeleton that provides protection. The beetle's coloration often includes a mix of black and yellow or orange markings, which serve as a warning to potential predators.
