                <h1>Acourtia dissiticeps</h1>
<p>Acourtia dissiticeps, commonly known as the hairy acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and features hairy stems and leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in a rounded shape.</p>
<p>Acourtia dissiticeps is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia dissiticeps has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, consisting of five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia dissiticeps is primarily native to the northeastern regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments within this area. The plant thrives in rocky soils and open habitats. Its distribution includes parts of the states of Nuevo León, Coahuila, and San Luis Potosí.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia dissiticeps was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon, where it thrives in sandy and dune environments.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities such as landscaping or accidental transport via vehicles and equipment. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It prefers full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
