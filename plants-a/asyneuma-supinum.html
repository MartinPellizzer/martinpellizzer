                    <h1>Asyneuma supinum</h1>
<p>Asyneuma supinum, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Asyneuma supinum is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
