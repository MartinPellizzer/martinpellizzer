                        <h1>Acacia verticillata var. cephalantha</h1>
<p>Acacia verticillata var. cephalantha, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers are clustered in spherical heads, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata var. cephalantha is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback, including high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological zones where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata var. cephalantha was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and capacity to provide shade and forage for livestock. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded lands across parts of Australia and other dry regions.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
