                    <h1>Artemisia mattfeldii</h1>
<p>Artemisia mattfeldii, commonly known as Mattfeld's sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, resinous scent, which is typical of many members of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of native plant communities in its range.</p>
