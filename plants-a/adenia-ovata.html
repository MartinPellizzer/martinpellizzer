                <h1>Adenia ovata</h1>
<p>Adenia ovata, commonly known as the African mountain almond, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Adenia ovata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia ovata has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are large, showy, and bisexual, with five petals that are usually pink or red in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and serve as storage organs, helping the plant survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia ovata is primarily native to Zambia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This plant thrives in moist, shaded areas within forest understories. It is commonly associated with humid climates and is often found in riverine forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Zambia's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia ovata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along stream banks where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Although it is not native to New Zealand, it has become established in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant is sometimes considered a weed in natural areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological impact of non-native species in new ecosystems.</p>
