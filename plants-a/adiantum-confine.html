                <h1>Adiantum confine</h1>
<p>Adiantum confine, commonly known as the narrow fern or the delicate maidenhair fern, is a member of the Adiantaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Adiantum confine is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum confine has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a feather-like appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure around 20-30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green and maintain their color throughout the growing season. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish bark. It does not produce showy flowers; instead, it relies on spores for reproduction, and its reproductive structures are hidden among the fronds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum confine is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This fern species is found in the diverse ecosystems of the island, including forests and rocky habitats. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, commonly growing near streams or in moist undergrowth. Adiantum confine is known for its delicate fronds and is a characteristic part of Madagascar's unique flora.</p>
<p>Its restricted native range highlights its ecological significance to the island's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum confine was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It has been found in states such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The plant is commonly associated with moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. It is often found in areas with rich, organic soil and high humidity.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on native plant species.</p>
