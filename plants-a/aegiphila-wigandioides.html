                <h1>Aegiphila wigandioides</h1>
<p>Aegiphila wigandioides, commonly known as the Brazilian bush bean, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila wigandioides has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and branched, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
