                <h1>Acer platanoides subsp. pictum</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides subsp.</p>
<p>pictum, commonly known as the painted maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree has a broad, spreading crown and can grow up to 30 meters tall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subsp.</p>
<p>pictum has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a doubly serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and can reach up to 12 cm in length; they are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, often displaying a reddish or bronze hue in autumn. The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a rare and ornamental maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains. While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in countries such as Romania, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, cool, and shaded environments, often found in forests with rich, well-drained soils. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered, and conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a decorative tree known for its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This species grows best in USDA hardiness zones 4-7, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, and benefits from a balanced fertilizer in early spring along with light pruning to maintain shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, and is best planted with companion species like conifers or flowering shrubs for visual contrast.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting other plant species. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for small animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a decorative tree known for its striking foliage, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture and landscape design. While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in some traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it has been used in folk remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, though its economic value is relatively low compared to other tree species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in botanical gardens and as a statement plant in urban environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
