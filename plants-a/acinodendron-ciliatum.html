                <h1>Acinodendron ciliatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron ciliatum, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Acinodendron ciliatum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ciliatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture, and a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ciliatum is primarily native to eastern Africa, specifically countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodland and savanna habitats, often growing near riverbanks or in secondary forests. It is an important component of the local flora and supports various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the climatic conditions of the East African region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ciliatum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native habitats.</p>
