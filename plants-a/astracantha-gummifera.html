                    <h1>Astracantha gummifera</h1>
<p>Astracantha gummifera, commonly known as the sticky thornveld, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its sap is thick and sticky, which can cause skin irritation, hence its common name.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
