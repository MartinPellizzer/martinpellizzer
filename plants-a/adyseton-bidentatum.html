                <h1>Adyseton bidentatum</h1>
<p>Adyseton bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which forms a tight, adherent layer on rock surfaces. The lichen's morphology includes distinct, branched lobes with a granular texture. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on limestone or silicate substrates.</p>
<p>Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological interactions and resistance to environmental stressors.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton bidentatum has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton bidentatum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas and along stream banks. This plant is commonly associated with wetland habitats and is often found in association with other moisture-loving species. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton bidentatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of ornamental plant introductions. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It has since spread beyond its original introduction sites due to its adaptability and reproductive capabilities.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
