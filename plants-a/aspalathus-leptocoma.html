                    <h1>Aspalathus leptocoma</h1>
<p>Aspalathus leptocoma, commonly known as the small-leaf rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape province of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the branches. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bean-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Aspalathus leptocoma is closely related to the more well-known rooibos plant, Aspalathus linearis, but differs in its leaf structure and habitat preferences.</p>
