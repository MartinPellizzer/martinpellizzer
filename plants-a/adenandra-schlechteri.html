<p>Adenandra schlechteri, commonly known as the Cape chestnut, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Adenandra schlechteri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra schlechteri has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra schlechteri is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the fynbos vegetation type, which is characteristic of the region. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous areas. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the Cape, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenandra schlechteri is often found in coastal and inland areas within the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra schlechteri was mainly introduced to areas with a subtropical climate characterized by warm, humid conditions and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with mild winters and abundant sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and coastal regions of Australia. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate moderate drought. It has been successfully established in various tropical and subtropical gardens, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
