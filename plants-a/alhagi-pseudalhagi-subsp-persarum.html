<p>Alhagi pseudalhagi subsp.</p>
<p>persarum, commonly known as the Persian sweet clover, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its seeds are often used for forage and soil stabilization due to their hardiness and nutritional value.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
