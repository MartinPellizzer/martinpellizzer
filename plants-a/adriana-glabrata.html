                <h1>Adriana glabrata</h1>
<p>Adriana glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf adriana, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adriana glabrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adriana glabrata has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a creeping growth pattern that allows it to spread along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana glabrata is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and western parts of the country. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. It is commonly found in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>This species is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana glabrata was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy and rocky coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought-resistant characteristics. It has since become naturalized in certain areas, posing a potential threat to native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to human activity and coastal development.</p>
