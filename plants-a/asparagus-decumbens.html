                    <h1>Asparagus decumbens</h1>
<p>Asparagus decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features sprawling, low-growing stems that often lie flat on the ground, covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
