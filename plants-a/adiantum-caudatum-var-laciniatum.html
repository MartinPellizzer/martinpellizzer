<p>Adiantum caudatum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the feather-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a feathery appearance, and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually through underground stems. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, with a distinctive black or dark green coloration on the underside.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shaded garden settings or as a houseplant.</p>
