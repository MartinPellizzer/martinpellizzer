                <h1>Aciphylla inermis</h1>
<p>Aciphylla inermis, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in short panicles. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Aciphylla inermis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla inermis has small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows close to the ground. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures that bloom in spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to store water and survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla inermis is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, particularly on the South Island. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as gravelly soils and open areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Aciphylla inermis is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla inermis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the west coast. The plant thrives in harsh, windy environments with poor soil nutrients. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
