                <h1>Arachnorchis hypata</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis hypata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, often on the bases of trees or in rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
