<p>Athyrium propinquum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender rhizome with bipinnate leaves that are finely divided and resemble feathers.

<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats.</p>
