                    <h1>Acacia morrisonii</h1>
<p>Acacia morrisonii, commonly known as the Morrison's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia morrisonii is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
