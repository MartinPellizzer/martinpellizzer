<p>It is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including the United States and Europe, as an ornamental plant. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range, though it remains more stable in cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achimenes jauregiana var. major is a vibrant, tuberous-rooted plant known for its showy, orchid-like flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through tuber division in spring or by seed, though tuber division is more reliable. The plant has a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring and flowering in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with regular watering, especially during the growing season. Fertilize with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few weeks and prune spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur if overwatered.</p>
<p>It pairs well with marigolds and begonias, which help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
