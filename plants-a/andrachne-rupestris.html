                    <h1>Andrachne rupestris</h1>
<p>Andrachne rupestris, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil make it well adapted to rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Andrachne rupestris is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it forms dense mats that stabilize the soil.</p>
