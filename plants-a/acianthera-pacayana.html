                <h1>Acianthera pacayana</h1>
<p>Acianthera pacayana, commonly known as the Pacayana orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Acianthera pacayana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera pacayana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals with a pale pink throat, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pacayana is primarily native to Guatemala.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the lowland and foothill areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within montane forests. The plant is commonly associated with areas that have high biodiversity and rich soil.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats in Guatemala, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pacayana was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy, fragrant flowers. It has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
