<p>Arachnaria macrura, commonly known as the long-spined bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects. The plant has thin, branching stems and is typically found in shallow, still waters. Its leaves are modified into bladder-like organs that are used to capture prey.</p>
<p>Arachnaria macrura plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
