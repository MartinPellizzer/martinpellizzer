                    <h1>Acer serotinum</h1>
<p>Acer serotinum, commonly known as late maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before its foliage emerges. Its seeds are enclosed in samaras, which are winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Acer serotinum typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
