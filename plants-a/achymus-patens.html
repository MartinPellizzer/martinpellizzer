                <h1>Achymus patens</h1>
<p>Achymus patens, commonly known as the spreading achymus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically features wiry stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in shades of white to pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achymus patens is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achymus patens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes slightly rough with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achymus patens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal regions of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is commonly found in dune ecosystems and maritime hammocks. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achymus patens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, small, white flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal areas. It is now considered a potential weed in some parts of the country.</p>
<p>Its spread is often associated with human activity and the movement of contaminated soil or plants.</p>
