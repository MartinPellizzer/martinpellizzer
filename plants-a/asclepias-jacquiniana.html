<p>Asclepias jacquiniana, commonly known as the Jacquin's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Asclepias jacquiniana plays a vital role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
