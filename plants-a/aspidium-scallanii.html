<p>Aspidium scallanii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, wiry stalks. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidium scallanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
