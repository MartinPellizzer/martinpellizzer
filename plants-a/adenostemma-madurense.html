                <h1>Adenostemma madurense</h1>
<p>Adenostemma madurense, commonly known as the Madura grass, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose panicles, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds.</p>
<p>Adenostemma madurense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma madurense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant to anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma madurense is primarily native to Assam, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, India, Laos, Malaya, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, open forests, and disturbed soils. The plant is often associated with wet or semi-wet environments.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution reflects its adaptability to different climatic conditions within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma madurense was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can thrive in sunny, open areas. This plant has the ability to spread rapidly, making it a potential invasive species in non-native regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its competitive nature and impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
