                    <h1>Aridaria compacta</h1>
<p>Aridaria compacta, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer, which are adapted to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Aridaria compacta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
