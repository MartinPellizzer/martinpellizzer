<p>Aiouea barbellata, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily pines and podocarps, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive, rough texture.</p>
<p>Aiouea barbellata plays a significant ecological role in New Zealand's forest ecosystems.</p>
