                    <h1>Aspalathus ciliaris</h1>
<p>Aspalathus ciliaris, commonly known as the sweet tea plant, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the local climate, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is notable for its use in the production of Rooibos tea, although it is often confused with Aspalathus linearis.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the fynbos vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
