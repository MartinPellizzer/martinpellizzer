                <h1>Acrostichum limbellatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum limbellatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with finely divided segments that create a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum limbellatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum limbellatum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a spreading pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruits are spherical berries that turn red when mature, dispersing their seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively across moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum limbellatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. This plant is also present in parts of New Guinea and the eastern Indian Ocean islands. It is well adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some areas of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum limbellatum was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and partial shade, typically near water bodies such as ponds, streams, and wetlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal regions or along riverbanks. This plant is known for its large, fern-like fronds and is commonly used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant species in some regions.</p>
