                    <h1>Androsace torrepandoi</h1>
<p>Androsace torrepandoi, commonly known as the mountain androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Androsace torrepandoi is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in conditions of low nutrient availability and intense sunlight.</p>
