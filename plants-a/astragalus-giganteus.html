                    <h1>Astragalus giganteus</h1>
<p>Astragalus giganteus, commonly known as giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Astragalus giganteus is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems.</p>
