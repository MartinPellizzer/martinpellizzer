                <h1>Adesmia trijuga</h1>
<p>Adesmia trijuga, commonly known as the three-angled legume, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many leguminous plants known for their nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, round seeds.</p>
<p>Adesmia trijuga is typically found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia trijuga has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 1 to 3 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a legume pod that matures into a dry, dehiscent pod, containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia trijuga is primarily native to Argentina Northwest, Argentina South, Chile Central, and Chile North.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in regions characterized by dry and semi-arid climates. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas. Adesmia trijuga is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its ability to thrive in diverse but often harsh ecological settings.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia trijuga was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii and Guam.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blue flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in these areas, often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some parts of its range.</p>
