                    <h1>Arenaria groenlandica var. glabra</h1>
<p>Arenaria groenlandica var. glabra, commonly known as Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from other varieties of Arenaria.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
