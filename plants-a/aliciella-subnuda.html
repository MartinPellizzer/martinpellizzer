                    <h1>Aliciella subnuda</h1>
<p>Aliciella subnuda, commonly known as the naked aliciella, is a rare and delicate fern native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
