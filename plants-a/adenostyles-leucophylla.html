                <h1>Adenostyles leucophylla</h1>
<p>Adenostyles leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed adenostyle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles leucophylla has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles leucophylla is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in chaparral and scrub habitats, particularly in coastal and inland regions. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy terrains. It is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Adenostyles leucophylla is an important component of the native flora in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles leucophylla was mainly introduced to California and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It prefers full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
