                <h1>Achillea aucheri</h1>
<p>Achillea aucheri, commonly known as the European yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that typically range from white to pale pink. The plant has feathery, finely divided leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Achillea aucheri is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are bright green, arranged in a rosette pattern, and measure up to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color, growing from the base to a height of about 30 centimeters. The flowers are compound umbels composed of small white to pale yellow florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions of France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is threatened by habitat loss and urbanization, leading to concerns about its long-term survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring good germination rates under suitable conditions. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, flowering in its second year before dying back, though it often reseeds itself for continuous coverage.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its ornamental appeal and supports beneficial insect activity.</p>
