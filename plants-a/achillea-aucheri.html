                <h1>Achillea aucheri</h1>
<p>Achillea aucheri, commonly known as the Armenian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, pale yellow to white composite flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with lance-shaped blades that are gray-green in color and have a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are compound umbels of small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in gardens and botanical collections across Europe and North America, though it remains rare in the wild. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea aucheri is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri is a hardy, compact perennial known for its fluffy, white to pink flower heads that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and becoming dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent blooms to encourage continuous flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
