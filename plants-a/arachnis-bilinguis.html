                    <h1>Arachnis bilinguis</h1>
<p>Arachnis bilinguis, commonly known as the two-language orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arachnis bilinguis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
