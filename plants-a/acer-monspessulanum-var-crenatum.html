<p>Acer monspessulanum var. crenatum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
