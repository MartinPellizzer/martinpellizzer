                    <h1>Asplenium macilwraithense</h1>
<p>Asplenium macilwraithense, commonly known as the Macilwraith holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or among heather. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>
