                    <h1>Atriplex latifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex latifolia, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant has a system of deep roots that allow it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Atriplex latifolia is often found in saline soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion.</p>
