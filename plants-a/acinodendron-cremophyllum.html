                <h1>Acinodendron cremophyllum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron cremophyllum, commonly known as the flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cremophyllum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cremophyllum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both primary and degraded forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cremophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and moderate rainfall. The plant is often found in lowland areas but can occasionally occur at higher elevations. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize bare ground make it a common invasive species in disturbed environments.</p>
<p>It is typically spread through seeds carried by wind, water, or human activity.</p>
