                    <h1>Agrostophyllum sumatranum</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the Dipterocarpaceae family, in tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
