<p>discolor, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a velvety appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting red or purple throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and blooms.</p>
<p>The subspecies discolor is distinguished by its more pronounced color variation in both leaves and flowers compared to other subspecies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon bedfordianum subsp.</p>
<p>discolor has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a smooth, dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter, sometimes fuzzy underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slightly woody texture as the plant matures.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pendulous, with a unique structure resembling a lantern, featuring pale yellow to greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat by anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
