                <h1>Achillea pindicola</h1>
<p>Achillea pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Pindus Mountains in Greece.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often with a slightly bitter scent.</p>
<p>Achillea pindicola is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pindicola has basal, lanceolate leaves that are grayish-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pindicola is primarily native to Albania, Greece, and the northwest Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is found in regions characterized by rocky and mountainous terrain. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and slopes. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within these countries.</p>
<p>It is a relatively rare species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pindicola was mainly introduced to specific regions of Greece, particularly the Pindus Mountains, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare and endemic species, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant's introduction to these areas is believed to be natural, as it has adapted to the local climate and soil conditions over time. Its distribution is limited due to its specific ecological requirements and the fragmented nature of its habitat.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from threats such as habitat loss and climate change.</p>
