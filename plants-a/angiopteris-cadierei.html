<p>Angiopteris cadierei, commonly known as the Cadi√®re's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Angiopteris cadierei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
