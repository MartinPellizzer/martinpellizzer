                    <h1>Atriplex parishii var. depressa</h1>
<p>Atriplex parishii var. depressa, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
