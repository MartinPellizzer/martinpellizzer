                    <h1>Alyxia lackii</h1>
<p>Alyxia lackii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as the ʻōhiʻa lehua, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Alyxia lackii produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws.</p>
