                    <h1>Acrostichum sorbifolium var. palustre</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sorbifolium var. palustre, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a variant of the sorbifolium fern that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, serrated leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a thick mat that helps stabilize soil in marshy areas. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is often found in freshwater wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important component of riparian and swamp ecosystems.</p>
