                    <h1>Adenostephanus</h1>
<p>Adenostephanus, commonly known as the desert star, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their low, sprawling growth habit and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The leaves are typically small, succulent, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Adenostephanus species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in spring.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
