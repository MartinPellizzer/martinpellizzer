                <h1>Adinandra cordata</h1>
<p>Adinandra cordata, commonly known as the African star jasmine, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped white flowers. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually elliptic or ovate leaves that are often glossy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adinandra cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its pleasant scent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra cordata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside; the leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and have a sweet scent; they bloom during the dry season and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and bird droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra cordata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is particularly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Adinandra cordata is also known to occur in parts of New Guinea and the islands of the western Pacific.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra cordata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
