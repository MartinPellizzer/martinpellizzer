                <h1>Adinandra cordata</h1>
<p>Adinandra cordata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy upper surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra cordata has elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra cordata is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and West Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. It prefers humid environments with high rainfall and is typically found in lowland and hill forest areas. Adinandra cordata is usually found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra cordata is a hardy evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and promote new shoots. Common pests include scale insects and aphids, while diseases such as root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
