                <h1>Acrophorus stipellatus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus stipellatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus stipellatus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus stipellatus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas within montane forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus stipellatus was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It has been observed in areas such as Hawaii, Guam, and parts of French Polynesia. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and along coastal areas, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage.</p>
