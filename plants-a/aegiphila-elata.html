                <h1>Aegiphila elata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila elata, commonly known as the silky aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in whorls, displaying shades of pink to purple.</p>
<p>Aegiphila elata is often found in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila elata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly rough upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and covered with a smooth, light grey bark that develops shallow fissures with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
