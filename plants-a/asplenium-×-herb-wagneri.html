                    <h1>Asplenium × herb-wagneri</h1>
<p>Asplenium × herb-wagneri, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring delicate, finely divided fronds with a dark green to bronze coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rich, humusy soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
