                    <h1>Acineta colossa</h1>
<p>Acineta colossa, commonly known as the giant acineta, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acineta colossa is considered a conservation concern.</p>
