                    <h1>Actinea lanigera</h1>
<p>Actinea lanigera, commonly known as the woolly actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the coastal waters of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy body covered in a dense layer of fine, soft spines that give it a woolly appearance. The polyps of Actinea lanigera are typically pale pink to orange in color and are arranged in a single row along the central axis of the organism. This species thrives in shallow, rocky intertidal zones where it attaches itself to substrates using its pedal disc.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in the ecosystem as both a prey item and a host for various marine organisms.</p>
