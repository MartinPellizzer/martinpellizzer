                <h1>Actinea lanigera</h1>
<p>Actinea lanigera, commonly known as the woolly actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the coastal waters of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy body covered in a dense layer of fine, soft spines that give it a woolly appearance. The polyps of Actinea lanigera are typically pale pink to orange in color and are arranged in a single row along the central axis of the organism. This species thrives in shallow, rocky intertidal zones where it attaches itself to substrates using its pedal disc.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in the ecosystem as both a prey item and a host for various marine organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea lanigera has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy green upper surface and a pale white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to brown bark that peels in thin layers. It produces delicate, umbel-like clusters of white flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind due to their lack of strong scent. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea lanigera is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. This species is commonly found in states including Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. It prefers acidic soils and is often associated with rich, organic substrates.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the understory vegetation in these forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea lanigera was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant has since spread to adjacent areas, including parts of Washington and British Columbia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be the result of horticultural trade and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
