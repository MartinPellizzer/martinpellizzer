                    <h1>Androsace glacialis</h1>
<p>Androsace glacialis, commonly known as the glacier bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features a rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the brief summer season, which are often clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often considered an indicator species of alpine ecosystems.</p>
