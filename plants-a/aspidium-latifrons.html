                    <h1>Aspidium latifrons</h1>
<p>Aspidium latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a delicate and feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
