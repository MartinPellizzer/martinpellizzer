                <h1>Achyrospermum micranthum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered achyrospermum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates.</p>
<p>The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum micranthum has compound, opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and they grow in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with pink to purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum micranthum is primarily native to Burundi, DR Congo, and Rwanda.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, lowland areas with high humidity. The species is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the central and eastern parts of the African continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum micranthum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate to high levels of water. It is often found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides in its introduced range.</p>
<p>However, it may pose a risk of becoming invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
