                    <h1>Agrostis nana var. aristata</h1>
<p>Agrostis nana var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted meadowgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
