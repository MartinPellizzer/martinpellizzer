                <h1>Adicea punctata</h1>
<p>Adicea punctata, commonly known as the spotted adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months of the year.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea punctata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five petals of pale yellow to white, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea punctata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is also present in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar habitats. It is commonly found in the understory of dense vegetation, where it benefits from the humid climate and partial sunlight.</p>
<p>Adicea punctata is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies by local communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea punctata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and land development.</p>
<p>It has spread to various regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in urban areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
