                <h1>Aechmea lagenaria</h1>
<p>Aechmea lagenaria, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces an inflorescence with vivid red bracts that surround a cluster of small white flowers. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>Aechmea lagenaria is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea lagenaria has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy blue-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. The plant produces striking red-brown flowers in a dense spike, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind and insects. The fruit is a spiky, urn-shaped capsule that disperses its seeds through wind and animal contact.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture.</p>
