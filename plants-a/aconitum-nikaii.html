                <h1>Aconitum nikaii</h1>
<p>Aconitum nikaii, commonly known as Nikai's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a deeply lobed structure that is typical of the genus Aconitum.</p>
<p>Aconitum nikaii contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum nikaii has leaves that are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hollow, with a bluish-green color and a growth pattern that is herbaceous and non-woody. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in cooler, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nikaii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and western China.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is commonly associated with the Tianshan and Altai mountain ranges, where it grows in moist, well-drained environments. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and forest clearings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nikaii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shady areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it poses a risk to both livestock and humans.</p>
