                <h1>Acridocarpus guineensis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus guineensis, commonly known as the African hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus guineensis has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with lanceolate-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale gray bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, featuring yellowish-white petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus guineensis is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of West and Central Africa, where it thrives in humid, lowland environments. This species typically grows in moist forests and along riverbanks, preferring areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for further protection and study.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus guineensis is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm climates with ample sunlight.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though aphids and root rot can occur if conditions are not properly managed.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>
