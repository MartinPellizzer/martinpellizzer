<p>It features a rosette of thick, spiny leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The leaves are dark green with a bluish tinge and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk topped with yellow-green flowers, which bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
