<p>Asplenium cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium cumingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
