<p>Aconitum pawlowskii, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has dark green, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for use in edible gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
