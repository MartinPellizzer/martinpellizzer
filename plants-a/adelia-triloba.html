                <h1>Adelia triloba</h1>
<p>Adelia triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed adelia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Adelia triloba thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia triloba has leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval-shaped, smooth, and a vibrant green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow with four petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia triloba is primarily native to Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Venezuela, and the Venezuelan Antilles.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, forested environments. Adelia triloba is commonly found in lowland and montane areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia triloba was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its distribution and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
