<p>Arenaria montana subsp.</p>
<p>montana, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are often borne on slender stems. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas of the western United States.</p>
