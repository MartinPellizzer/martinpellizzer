<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow shape that sets it apart from other fern species.</p>
