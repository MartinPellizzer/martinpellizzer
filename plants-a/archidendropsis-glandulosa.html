                    <h1>Archidendropsis glandulosa</h1>
<p>Archidendropsis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in yellow or greenish hues, and it produces legume-like pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>The glandular features of its leaves are thought to play a role in deterring herbivores and may also aid in water retention.</p>
