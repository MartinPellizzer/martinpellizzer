<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abena jamaicensis is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the island environments of the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abena jamaicensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly in the Lesser Antilles, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
