                <h1>Acronychia tetrandra</h1>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra, commonly known as the Australian ash or broad-leaved ash, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northeastern Australia and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating. Acronychia tetrandra is often found in rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a brownish-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of northern Australia, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized. This plant thrives in wet, lowland rainforests and is typically found in humid, shaded environments. It grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its populations are vulnerable due to habitat loss and deforestation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter method offering faster results. The growth cycle of this plant is slow to moderate, with new growth occurring primarily during the wet season.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining, fertile soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and encourage air circulation are recommended.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may occasionally attract scale insects or fungal issues in damp conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or neem trees beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the surrounding area. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by offering ecological benefits that support a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its fruits are edible and often used in local dishes, adding a unique flavor.
