                <h1>Acronychia tetrandra</h1>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra, commonly known as the Four-threaded Acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture with a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and fragrant, typically yellowish-green, and are followed by small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a spherical drupe, about 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter, containing a single seed, and it is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly the Northern Territory and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen in lowland and montane regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia tetrandra was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland rainforests, where it thrives in warm, moist environments. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures. It has been introduced to several Pacific islands and parts of Southeast Asia as a decorative and potentially medicinal plant.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native ecosystems.</p>
