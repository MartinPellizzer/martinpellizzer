<p>Acacia jutsonii, commonly known as the Jutson's wattle, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which appear during the warmer months. Acacia jutsonii is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for various native insects and birds.</p>
