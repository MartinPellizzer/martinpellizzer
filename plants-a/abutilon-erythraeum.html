                        <h1>Abutilon erythraeum</h1>
<p>Abutilon erythraeum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, maple-like leaves and clusters of orange-red, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
