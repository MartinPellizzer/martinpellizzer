                <h1>Aegiphila loretensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila loretensis, commonly known as the Loretto's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila loretensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a slightly pubescent surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, displaying a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, light gray bark, exhibiting a creeping growth pattern that often forms dense mats. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry, rocky soils in which the plant thrives.</p>
