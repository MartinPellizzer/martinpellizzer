                    <h1>Acmadenia argillophila</h1>
<p>Acmadenia argillophila, commonly known as the clay soil acmadenia, is a low-growing shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in sandy or clay soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes.</p>
