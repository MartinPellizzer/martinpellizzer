<p>Alchemilla achtarowii, commonly known as the Achtarowian lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Alchemilla achtarowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
