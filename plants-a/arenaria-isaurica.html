<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in its dry habitat.</p>
