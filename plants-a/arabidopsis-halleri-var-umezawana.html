                    <h1>Arabidopsis halleri var. umezawana</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis halleri var. umezawana, commonly known as the Umezawa's rock cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and small white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes. It is notable for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation studies.</p>
<p>Its genome has been studied for its role in understanding plant biology and adaptation to environmental stress.</p>
