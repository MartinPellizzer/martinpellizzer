<p>Arthrocnemum brachystachyum, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum brachystachyum plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
