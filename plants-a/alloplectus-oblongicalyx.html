<p>Alloplectus oblongicalyx, commonly known as the broad-leafed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves and specialized bladder-like structures.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is known for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms in its bladders, which it uses for nutrient acquisition. Its root system is adventitious, allowing it to anchor itself in muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Alloplectus oblongicalyx plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
