                <h1>Adolia obcordata</h1>
<p>Adolia obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adolia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its narrow, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolia obcordata has leaves that are ovate with a rounded base, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 5-8 cm in length with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia obcordata is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas within dense forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and is often associated with montane and lowland forest ecosystems. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Southeast Asia, though its presence there is less documented.</p>
<p>Adolia obcordata plays a role in local biodiversity and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia obcordata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in sensitive environments.</p>
