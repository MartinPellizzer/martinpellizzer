                    <h1>Arpophyllum medium</h1>
<p>Arpophyllum medium, commonly known as the coastal shrub, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal forests.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
