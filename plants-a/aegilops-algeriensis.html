                <h1>Aegilops algeriensis</h1>
<p>Aegilops algeriensis, commonly known as Algerian goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aegilops algeriensis is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops algeriensis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a pale green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets with two to three florets, and the flowers are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled caryopsis, with seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>
