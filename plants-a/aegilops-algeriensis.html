<p>Aegilops algeriensis, commonly known as Algerian goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aegilops algeriensis is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
