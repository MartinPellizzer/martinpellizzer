                <h1>Acer regelii</h1>
<p>Acer regelii, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that display vibrant colors in autumn. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. It typically grows to a height of 5–10 meters and prefers well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer regelii has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a broad, heart-shaped base and a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green during the growing season and turning red or yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grey-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth habit. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and lack showy petals. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind as the seeds are released from the ripe fruits.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils, providing stability and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer regelii is a rare and unique maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and western China.</p>
<p>Although it was once thought to be extinct, it has been rediscovered in its native habitat, primarily in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in mountain forests. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Acer regelii is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer regelii is a striking evergreen maple known for its vibrant, glossy foliage and unique ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed stratification or by stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining cultivar traits. This slow-growing plant thrives in partial shade to full sun, preferring well-draining, acidic soil and consistent moisture without waterlogging. Regular fertilization in spring and light pruning to shape the plant and remove dead foliage promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract scale insects or leaf spot under poor conditions, and it pairs well with ferns and heathers in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer regelii is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms. Its dense growth habit acts as a companion plant, offering protection to other species in the ecosystem. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer regelii is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and is commonly used in horticulture for landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing wood for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and is often featured in botanical art and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer regelii has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are highly valued in horticulture for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Kobold', known for their striking foliage and compact growth habits. It is also a parent in several hybrids, such as the Japanese maple group, which combines the hardiness of Acer regelii with the vibrant colors of other maple species. These varieties are important in landscaping due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Horticulturally, Acer regelii plays a significant role in creating diverse and visually appealing gardens.</p>
