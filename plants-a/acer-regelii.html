                <h1>Acer regelii</h1>
<p>Acer regelii, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and prefers well-drained soil in a partially shaded to sunny location. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer regelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer regelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, turning red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer regelii is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, specifically found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these regions. It thrives in cool, humid environments, typically growing in shaded, moist forests. Acer regelii is commonly found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer regelii is a unique evergreen maple known for its dense foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil with consistent moisture. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or root rot, and it pairs well with ferns and heathers in a shady garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer regelii is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer regelii is a unique plant known for its ornamental value, particularly in horticulture, where its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The plant has limited industrial uses but contributes to the ecological balance by supporting local wildlife and providing habitat. Culturally, it is sometimes symbolized as a representation of resilience and beauty in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its role in conservation and biodiversity makes it important for ecological research and environmental preservation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer regelii has several popular cultivars such as 'Sutherlandii' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their unique foliage patterns and compact growth.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in many hybrids, including the popular 'Acer palmatum' varieties, contributing to the diversity within the maple family. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and improved ornamental traits, making them more adaptable to different climates. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its role as a foundational species for breeding programs aimed at developing new maple cultivars.</p>
<p>Its aesthetic appeal and genetic versatility have made it a valuable asset in both landscape design and botanical research.</p>
