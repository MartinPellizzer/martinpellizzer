<p>Aspidium difforme, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium difforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
