                <h1>Adinandra plagiobasis</h1>
<p>Adinandra plagiobasis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and strength, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Adinandra plagiobasis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra plagiobasis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring around 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that has a slightly rough texture. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra plagiobasis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Southeast Asian region. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically growing in the understorey of primary forests. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Borneo, where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>
<p>Adinandra plagiobasis is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra plagiobasis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for regions with high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and secondary forests. Its introduction has led to its spread in regions where it can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and urban landscapes.</p>
