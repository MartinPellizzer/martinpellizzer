                <h1>Acroceras basicladum</h1>
<p>Acroceras basicladum, commonly known as the roughleaf acroceras, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras basicladum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright with minimal branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras basicladum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy terrain. It is a small annual herb with distinctive blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras basicladum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal and disturbed areas, often colonizing sandy or gravelly soils. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been expanding, raising concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
