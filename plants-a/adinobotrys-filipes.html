                <h1>Adinobotrys filipes</h1>
<p>Adinobotrys filipes, commonly known as the slender-leafed adinobotrys, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, usually with four or five petals.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, making it an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys filipes has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys filipes is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in humid and shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats, where it thrives in the understorey. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological preferences, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys filipes was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its distinctive, finger-like leaves and yellow flowers. It has been documented in various locations across the island, including Molokai and Maui.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
