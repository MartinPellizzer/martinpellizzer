                    <h1>Azorella trifurcata var. normalis</h1>
<p>Azorella trifurcata var. normalis, commonly known as the Andean snowbell, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Azorella trifurcata var. normalis is well adapted to high-altitude ecosystems and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
