                <h1>Acrotrema uniflorum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower acrotrema, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated flower that develops from a modified stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions with cool climates. Its small, delicate leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acrotrema uniflorum is considered a rare species with limited ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema uniflorum has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with five petals, blooming in late spring, and it is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema uniflorum is primarily native to India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist and shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. The species is known for its small, clustered flowers and is part of the family Rhabdodendraceae.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these geographic areas, with limited records outside of South Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema uniflorum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Washington State. The plant has since spread to neighboring areas, including parts of Oregon and British Columbia. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
