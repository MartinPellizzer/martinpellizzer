                    <h1>Antholoma haplopoda</h1>
<p>Antholoma haplopoda, commonly known as the woolly antholoma, is a species of fungus within the family Hyphomycetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance, which gives it a distinctive visual texture. This fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, temperate environments. Its spore-producing structures, called conidiophores, are often covered in a layer of fine, hairy cells.</p>
<p>Antholoma haplopoda is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in forest decomposition processes.</p>
