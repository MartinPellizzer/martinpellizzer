                    <h1>Aellenia glauca</h1>
<p>Aellenia glauca, commonly known as the blue-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, which helps it blend with its surroundings. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by berries that are usually red or yellow. Aellenia glauca is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments and relies on its host for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
