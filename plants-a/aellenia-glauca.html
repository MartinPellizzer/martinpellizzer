                <h1>Aellenia glauca</h1>
<p>Aellenia glauca, commonly known as the blue-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, which helps it blend with its surroundings. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by berries that are usually red or yellow. Aellenia glauca is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments and relies on its host for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aellenia glauca has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale, waxy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 3â€“6 cm long and arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption.</p>
