                <h1>Actinodaphne percoriacea</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea, commonly known as the Bornean sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, brown seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its fragrant properties, it has been historically valued for its wood in traditional medicine and incense.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers, and it grows upright with a dense, bushy habit. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing primarily by birds eating the fruit and spreading the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, forming a dense network near the soil surface to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region, specifically found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely confined to its native range, with limited cultivation outside of its natural habitat. It thrives in humid lowland forests, often growing in shaded understories with rich, well-drained soil. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as Near Threatened by some organizations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between sessions. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may attract scale insects or mealybugs in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea is a valuable plant in tropical ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and moths, supporting biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest understories, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other native species. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a network of interdependent organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its diverse uses and applications.</p>
