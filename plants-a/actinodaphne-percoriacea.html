                <h1>Actinodaphne percoriacea</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea, commonly known as the fragrant lauraceae, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. It typically grows as a small tree or shrub, often in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it valuable for both ecological studies and potential medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical drupe with a yellowish exterior, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant is commonly associated with lowland and hill forest areas, often growing along the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem as a source of food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a valuable component of Borneo's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne percoriacea was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often growing in shaded, humid environments. This plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its introduction has also been noted in parts of Oceania and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of these regions.</p>
