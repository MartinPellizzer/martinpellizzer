                <h1>Acer henryi var. serratum</h1>
<p>Acer henryi var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras with two winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer henryi var. serratum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins and alternate arrangement, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and they display a vibrant green color in summer, turning yellow to orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate trees, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer henryi var. serratum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and western China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it grows in cool, moist temperate forests. It thrives in shaded, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer henryi var. serratum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique foliage structure.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in USDA hardiness zones 5-8.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer henryi var. serratum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer henryi var. serratum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and autumn coloration.</p>
<p>While not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional teas in some cultures. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. Its wood is sometimes used in small-scale woodworking due to its durability and fine grain.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in various regions where it is native.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer henryi var. serratum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crispum' and 'Sutherlandii', which are prized for their distinctive leaf patterns and vibrant fall colors.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in various hybrids, including the widely cultivated 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King', which showcase enhanced ornamental traits. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden environments. The species contributes significantly to the diversity of maple trees in ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Its genetic material continues to be important in breeding programs aimed at improving maple cultivars for garden use.</p>
