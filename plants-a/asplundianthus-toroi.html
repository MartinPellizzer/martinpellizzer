<p>Asplundianthus toroi, commonly known as the Toroi thornapple, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often avoided due to their bitter taste. Asplundianthus toroi is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals.</p>
