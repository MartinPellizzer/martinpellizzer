                <h1>Abutilon lanatum</h1>
<p>Abutilon lanatum, commonly known as velvetleaf or woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in leaf axils. Its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves are notable botanical features.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon lanatum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are pubescent, with a velvety texture and a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring 5–10 cm in length and 3–6 cm in width. The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are clustered in panicles, with five petals that are pale yellow to greenish-white, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon lanatum is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers environments such as forests, shrublands, and riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Abutilon lanatum is not currently listed as endangered, but its distribution has been impacted by habitat loss and over-collection in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon lanatum is a fast-growing, ornamental plant known for its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under ideal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes vigorous growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage blooming. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abutilon lanatum is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the pollination of other nearby plants. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to improve soil structure. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Abutilon lanatum plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and supporting healthy ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
