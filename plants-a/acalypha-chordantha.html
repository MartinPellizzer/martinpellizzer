<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized leaves and flowers. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with latex and often showy flowers. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants known for their showy, often colorful bracts and diverse growth forms.</p>
