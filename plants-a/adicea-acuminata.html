                <h1>Adicea acuminata</h1>
<p>Adicea acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed adicea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adicea acuminata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea acuminata has simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped, glossy green, and typically 5â€“10 cm long, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea acuminata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Angola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. It grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters.</p>
<p>Adicea acuminata is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional healing practices across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea acuminata was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. The introduction of this plant has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. It spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its rapid establishment in new areas.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native flora and fauna is still being studied in many regions.</p>
