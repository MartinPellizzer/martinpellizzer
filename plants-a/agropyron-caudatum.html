<p>Agropyron caudatum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Agropyron caudatum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is sometimes used in restoration ecology.</p>
