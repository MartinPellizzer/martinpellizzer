<p>Aristida coerulescens var. breviaristata, commonly known as the shortgrass needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
