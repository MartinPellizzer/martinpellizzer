<p>Alectra minor, commonly known as the small red cup fungus, is a small, delicate mushroom that belongs to the family Physaraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, cup-shaped cap that is typically reddish in color, often with a slight sheen. The stem is short and slender, and the spore-producing structure is located at the base of the cap. This species is often found in moist, shaded areas, particularly in association with decaying wood or leaf litter.</p>
<p>Alectra minor is notable for its unique morphology and is commonly observed in temperate forest environments.</p>
