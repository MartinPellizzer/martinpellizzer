<p>Arenaria erinacea subsp.</p>
<p>microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry slopes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and habitat restoration.</p>
