<p>Amaranthus lividus subsp.</p>
<p>oleraceus, commonly known as tumbleweed amaranth, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from green to red.</p>
<p>The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its role as a pioneer species in disturbed soils. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it both a weed and a potential forage crop.</p>
