                    <h1>Archibaccharis venturana</h1>
<p>Archibaccharis venturana, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of resinous exudate, which provides some resistance to herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to salty, windy environments and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
