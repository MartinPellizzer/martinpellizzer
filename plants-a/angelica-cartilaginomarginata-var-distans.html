                    <h1>Angelica cartilaginomarginata var. distans</h1>
<p>Angelica cartilaginomarginata var. distans, commonly known as the distant angelica, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the angelica genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, large, and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbrella-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It is native to specific regions in East Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
