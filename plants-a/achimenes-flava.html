                <h1>Achimenes flava</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Achimenses flava, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant yellow flowers with a bell-shaped corolla. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Achimenes flava is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes flava has heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy green surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, with bright yellow petals and a deep orange throat, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive dry periods.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes flava is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Achimenes flava is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range highlights its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems within Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes flava was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream sides. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through its rhizomes and seeds dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
