                        <h1>Abies cranstonii</h1>
<p>Abies cranstonii, commonly known as the Cranston fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the shoots. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Cranston fir is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies cranstonii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is found in high-elevation areas, typically in coniferous forests. This species is adapted to cool, moist climates and grows in rocky or mountainous terrain. It is often associated with other high-altitude conifers such as Douglas fir and lodgepole pine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies cranstonii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This species thrives in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It is commonly associated with mixed coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
