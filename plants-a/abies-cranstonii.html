                    <h1>Abies cranstonii</h1>
<p>Abies cranstonii, commonly known as the Cranston fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the shoots. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Cranston fir is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
