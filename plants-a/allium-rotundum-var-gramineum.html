<p>Allium rotundum var. gramineum, commonly known as Persian leek or garlic chives, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features grass-like, hollow, and cylindrical leaves that are often mistaken for true grasses. The plant produces small, clustered, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs, which are smaller than those of regular garlic, have a mild garlic flavor and are used in various culinary applications.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other Allium species such as garlic and onions.</p>
