<p>Artemisia lanata subsp.</p>
<p>assoana, commonly known as the woolly sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, sometimes pungent scent.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions.</p>
