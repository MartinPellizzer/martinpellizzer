                    <h1>Agrostis berica</h1>
<p>Agrostis berica, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
<p>Agrostis berica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
