                    <h1>Acer hispanicum var. gieniense</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. gieniense, commonly known as the Gienese maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
