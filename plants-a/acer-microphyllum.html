                <h1>Acer microphyllum</h1>
<p>Acer microphyllum, commonly known as the western red cedar, is a deciduous tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer microphyllum has small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, which are slender and often twining, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and is wind-pollinated. Its fruits are samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread in open areas.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer microphyllum is a small, deciduous tree native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra Nevada and coastal ranges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shady, forested environments, typically found in mountainous regions. This species grows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer microphyllum is listed as endangered or critically endangered in many areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer microphyllum is a small deciduous tree known for its delicate, finely lobed leaves and preference for moist environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer microphyllum involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and leaf spot, and it pairs well with ferns and other shade-loving plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer microphyllum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, especially in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological health by improving soil structure and nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer microphyllum is a small, deciduous tree known for its unique, palmately lobed leaves and is primarily valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and gardens.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been used by Indigenous peoples for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Economically, it contributes to the horticultural industry by providing aesthetic value in urban and rural environments.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often appearing in regional art and folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer microphyllum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Sutherlandii', which are known for their striking foliage patterns and compact growth habits. Hybrids involving Acer microphyllum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance, especially in shaded garden settings where they provide vibrant seasonal color.</p>
<p>Their adaptability makes them popular choices for landscaping in temperate climates.</p>
