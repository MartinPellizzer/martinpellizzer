                <h1>Acer glabrum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Acer glabrum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces opposite, ovate leaves that turn bright red in the fall, adding ornamental value. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. glabrum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning bright red in the fall. The stem is straight and grows upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. glabrum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in parts of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Although historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in coniferous or mixed forests, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This variety typically occurs at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat degradation, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. glabrum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to maintain shape and promote air circulation are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. glabrum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. glabrum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
