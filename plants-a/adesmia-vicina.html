<p>Adesmia vicina, commonly known as the small-leaf burro bush, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Adesmia vicina is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
