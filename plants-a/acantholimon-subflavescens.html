                        <h1>Acantholimon subflavescens</h1>
<p>Acantholimon subflavescens, commonly known as the flaxleaf flaxflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon subflavescens belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some algae, characterized by their complex structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes species like carnations and beets, known for their distinctive floral structures. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadwort family, characterized by their often showy flowers and medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and rocky habitats, known for their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon subflavescens, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and small, pinkish flowers, often found in Mediterranean and coastal regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon subflavescens is primarily native to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is often associated with alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Afghanistan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon subflavescens was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and grassland habitats. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and silver-gray foliage. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
