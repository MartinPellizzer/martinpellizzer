                        <h1>Acantholimon huetii</h1>
<p>Acantholimon huetii, commonly known as the Huet's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern France and northern Spain.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
