                <h1>Adelmeria gigantifolia</h1>
<p>Adelmeria gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant silver bush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal climates.</p>
<p>Adelmeria gigantifolia is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelmeria gigantifolia has large, broadly elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a waxy texture and a pinnately compound arrangement.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and grows in a shrub-like form, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish in color. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that are pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant in rocky soils and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria gigantifolia is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the archipelago, particularly in the northern and central parts. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within primary and secondary forests. It is commonly associated with limestone substrates and is often found in areas with high biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria gigantifolia was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California, particularly in the northern part of the state.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Pacific coast, often growing in association with other coastal vegetation. This plant is typically found in areas with mild, moist climates and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants for resources.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and climate change, leading to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
