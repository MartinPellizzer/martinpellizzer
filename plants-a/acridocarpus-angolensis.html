                <h1>Acridocarpus angolensis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus angolensis, commonly known as the African hibiscus, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus angolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus angolensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to grey in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth habit. The flowers are small, clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the dry season, likely relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a globose, woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus angolensis is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. This plant is often associated with coastal and inland dunes, where it can withstand harsh environmental conditions. It is also present in parts of Zimbabwe and Mozambique.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus angolensis is well adapted to dry climates and is an important component of local vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus angolensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, often growing in disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it adaptable to various environments. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native flora in invaded areas.</p>
