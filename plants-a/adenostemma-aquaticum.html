                <h1>Adenostemma aquaticum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma aquaticum, commonly known as water bladdernut, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and often have a pale yellow to greenish color.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in aquatic environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma aquaticum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in wet soil, often found in marshy or aquatic environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma aquaticum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often seen in swampy areas. It is also present in parts of the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution is due to its adaptability to diverse wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma aquaticum was mainly introduced to wetlands and water bodies in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow water and moist soil, often forming dense stands that can alter local ecosystems. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in ponds, lakes, and along canal edges.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on biodiversity and water quality in these habitats.</p>
