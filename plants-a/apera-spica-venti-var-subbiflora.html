                    <h1>Apera spica-venti var. subbiflora</h1>
<p>Apera spica-venti var. subbiflora, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as fields, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often wind-dispersed. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its sub-biflorous inflorescence, where each spikelet contains two flowers, distinguishing it from other varieties of Apera spica-venti.</p>
