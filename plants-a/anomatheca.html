                    <h1>Anomatheca</h1>
<p>Anomatheca, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of a single species, Anomatheca salsolae, which is native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It has a succulent, cushion-like growth form with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in Anomatheca lies in its unique adaptations to arid conditions and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
