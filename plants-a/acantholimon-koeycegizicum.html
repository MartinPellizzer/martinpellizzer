                <h1>Acantholimon koeycegizicum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon koeycegizicum, commonly known as the Koeycegiz stonecress, is a flowering plant native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acantholimon koeycegizicum has leaves that are typically narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged in a basal rosette with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, grayish-brown bark and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon koeycegizicum is a rare flowering plant native to the Aegean region of Turkey, specifically the island of Gökçeada (known as Imvros in Greek).</p>
<p>It is currently known only from a very limited area within the northern part of the island. This species thrives in rocky, coastal environments, often growing on limestone outcrops. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 10 to 50 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acantholimon koeycegizicum is a resilient, flowering plant native to Turkey, known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing mature clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. This plant has a perennial growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in summer, with a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained sandy or loamy soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials like lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acantholimon koeycegizicum is a plant that provides essential food and shelter for local wildlife and contributes to soil stabilization, acting as an effective erosion control plant in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts various pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem. The plant also serves as a companion plant for other native species, enhancing the overall health of the surrounding vegetation. Its presence helps maintain soil moisture and prevents nutrient leaching, benefiting the broader ecological community.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in supporting local fauna by offering a habitat and food source throughout different seasons.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acantholimon koeycegizicum is a rare plant native to Turkey, known for its potential in medicinal applications due to its bioactive compounds, which may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary traditions, it could be explored for its nutritional value in local diets. Its limited distribution and unique characteristics make it a subject of interest for ecological and conservation studies, contributing to regional biodiversity. The plant holds cultural significance in its native area, where it may be symbolically associated with resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its industrial and economic potential.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acantholimon koeycegizicum has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albiflorum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking white flowers and variegated foliage. Hybrids of this species have been developed to enhance traits such as flower color, plant size, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in rocky and arid conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in gardens and public landscapes for their aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
