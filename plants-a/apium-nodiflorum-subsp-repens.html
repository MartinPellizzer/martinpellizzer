<p>Apium nodiflorum subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as creeping cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a mild parsley-like scent.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
