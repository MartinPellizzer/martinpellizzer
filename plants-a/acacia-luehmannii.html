                        <h1>Acacia luehmannii</h1>
<p>Acacia luehmannii, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The wood of Acacia luehmannii is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tool-making.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia luehmannii is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton area. This species thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acacia luehmannii is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia luehmannii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate, often found in regions with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed sites. This plant is commonly used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Australia, South Africa, and the United States.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly.</p>
