                        <h1>Acacia luehmannii</h1>
<p>Acacia luehmannii, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The wood of Acacia luehmannii is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tool-making.</p>
