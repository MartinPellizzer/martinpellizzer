                            <h1>Arctium Tenellum</h1>
<p>Arctium tenellum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiky stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its most distinctive feature is the bur-like seed pods that cling to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. This hardy plant thrives in a variety of environments, from meadows to disturbed soils, and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
