                    <h1>Aptosimum decumbens</h1>
<p>Aptosimum decumbens, commonly known as the desert tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features wiry, decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Aptosimum decumbens is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
