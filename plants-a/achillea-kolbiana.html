                <h1>Achillea kolbiana</h1>
<p>Achillea kolbiana, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads that are arranged in flat-topped clusters. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Achillea kolbiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea kolbiana has compound, basal leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slender, with a light green color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea kolbiana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of northern India.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, often in alpine and subalpine environments. This species thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, typically at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable, with conservation efforts ongoing to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea kolbiana is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea kolbiana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea kolbiana contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea kolbiana is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential in traditional medicine for its possible anti-inflammatory properties. Its role in supporting local biodiversity makes it important in ecological restoration projects. The plant also holds cultural significance in some regions, where it is used in folk traditions and rituals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited commercial use, its economic impact remains relatively minor compared to other plants in its genus.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
