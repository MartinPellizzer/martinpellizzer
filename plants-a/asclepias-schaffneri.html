<p>Asclepias schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Schaffner's milkweed is an important host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the monarch and queen butterflies.</p>
