<p>Agrostis quadriseta, commonly known as the four-row bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically reaches a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Agrostis quadriseta is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
