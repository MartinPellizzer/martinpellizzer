                <h1>Aegilops singularis</h1>
<p>Aegilops singularis, commonly known as the spikelet grass, is a wild annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its spread across various habitats.</p>
<p>Aegilops singularis is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to wheat and its potential for agricultural research.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops singularis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear, slightly folded, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is primarily erect. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers that bloom in early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>
