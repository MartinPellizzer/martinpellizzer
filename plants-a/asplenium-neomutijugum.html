<p>Asplenium neomutijugum, commonly known as the New Guinea spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a smooth texture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are usually less than 30 centimeters in length.</p>
