                    <h1>Aspidium basilare</h1>
<p>Aspidium basilare, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has a delicate, floating frond structure with a short, creeping rhizome that anchors it to the substrate. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, rounded lobes that help it capture light and float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Aspidium basilare plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
