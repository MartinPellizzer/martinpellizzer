                    <h1>Androcera rostrata</h1>
<p>Androcera rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that bear small, fragrant blossoms in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in the rich, organic soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure includes specialized pollination mechanisms that attract specific insect pollinators.</p>
