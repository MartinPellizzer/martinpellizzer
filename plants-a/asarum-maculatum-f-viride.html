<p>Asarum maculatum f. viride, commonly known as green-spotted wild ginger, is a variant of the wild ginger plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive greenish-tinged underside. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
