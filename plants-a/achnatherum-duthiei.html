                <h1>Achnatherum duthiei</h1>
<p>Achnatherum duthiei, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Achnatherum duthiei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum duthiei has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually linear, flat, and have a bluish-green color, arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a light green to yellowish color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry seed enclosed in a bract, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum duthiei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and western China, including the Tibetan Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and alpine meadows, often found at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. This plant is commonly associated with arid and semi-arid environments, where it forms part of the local vegetation. It is also found in parts of Nepal and northern India, extending its native range into the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for cold and dry climates, it is a characteristic species of the Tibetan and Himalayan ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum duthiei was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states such as Nevada, Utah, and California.</p>
<p>It has been found in areas with arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. This plant is typically found in grasslands, sandy soils, and along roadsides. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, such as transportation and land development.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in these regions.</p>
