                <h1>Actinostrobus arenarius</h1>
<p>Actinostrobus arenarius, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure makes it an important plant for pollinators such as birds and insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostrobus arenarius has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostrobus arenarius is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the state, particularly in sandy soils along the shores. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dunes or coastal heathlands. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the region, including high salinity and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role, it is an important component of the local flora in Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostrobus arenarius was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and stabilize sand dunes in coastal and arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant has shallow roots that help bind the soil, preventing wind and water erosion. However, its aggressive growth can lead to the displacement of native vegetation in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological benefits, its introduction requires careful management to avoid unintended impacts on local ecosystems.</p>
