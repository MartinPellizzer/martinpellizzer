                <h1>Achillea flabelliformis</h1>
<p>Achillea flabelliformis, commonly known as the broad-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, fern-like leaves and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea flabelliformis has compound, fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a grayish-green color and a serrated edge, arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish in color, growing from the base to a height of about 30-60 cm. The flowers are yellow, forming flat, umbrella-shaped clusters called inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea flabelliformis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, France, and Morocco, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats like cliffs, slopes, and coastal dunes. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea flabelliformis is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea flabelliformis is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea flabelliformis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the ecosystem's biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea flabelliformis plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators, wildlife, and soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea flabelliformis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it can be grown in gardens for its attractive, fern-like foliage and pale yellow flowers. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and horticulture.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea flabelliformis has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Aurea' and 'Silver King,' which are known for their striking foliage and long-lasting blooms.</p>
<p>The plant is also used in hybridization to create varieties with enhanced traits such as improved disease resistance and extended flowering periods. These hybrids often combine the hardiness of Achillea flabelliformis with the color diversity of other yarrow species. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions, making it a versatile choice for gardeners.</p>
<p>As a result, it remains a valuable addition to both wildflower gardens and landscaped areas.</p>
