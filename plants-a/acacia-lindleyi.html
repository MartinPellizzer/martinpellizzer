<p>Acacia lindleyi, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia lindleyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
