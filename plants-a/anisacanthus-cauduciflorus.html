<p>Anisacanthus cauduciflorus, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, candle-like yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody, branching stems and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often with a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in dry, rocky soils.</p>
