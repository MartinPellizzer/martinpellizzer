<p>Artemisia tilesii var. arctica, commonly known as arctic wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in narrow, cylindrical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
