                <h1>Achyranthes albida</h1>
<p>Achyranthes albida, commonly known as white knotweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant's roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes albida has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, bluish-green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale green to white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it thrive in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes albida is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Southeast Asian nations.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, warm climates and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, where it has adapted to similar environmental conditions. It is often seen growing in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and its rapid reproductive cycle.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes albida was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common invasive species in many regions. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities like land development and agricultural practices.</p>
<p>It is now found in several countries across Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
