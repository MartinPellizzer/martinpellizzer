                    <h1>Alectorolophus kyrollae</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus kyrollae, commonly known as the Kyrolla's featherhead, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, feather-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which bloom during the short growing season. Its root system is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils, and it is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, Alectorolophus kyrollae is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
