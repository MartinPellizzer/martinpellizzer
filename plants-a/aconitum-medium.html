                <h1>Aconitum medium</h1>
<p>Aconitum medium, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum medium is notable for its toxic alkaloids, making it both a dangerous and valuable plant in botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum medium has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a bluish-green color and a tendency to develop a woody texture as it matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spurs, arranged in a dense spike, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>
