                <h1>Acer campestre var. eriocarpon</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. eriocarpon, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a variant of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on the young shoots and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that mature in late summer.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in woodland edges and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. eriocarpon has oval-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and gray-brown in color, with a straight growth pattern and a rough texture as it ages. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. eriocarpon is a variant of the field maple, native to southern Europe, particularly in regions of Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern France and Italy, though it is less common today. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. eriocarpon is a compact, slow-growing maple known for its distinctive foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in stressed conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. eriocarpon is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in forest understories, supporting biodiversity and enhancing soil stability. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for numerous species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. eriocarpon is a lesser-known variant of the horse chestnut tree, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may have minor roles in traditional herbal remedies. In industrial contexts, its wood is not commonly utilized due to its relatively soft nature. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local folklore or as a marker of regional biodiversity.</p>
<p>Overall, its main applications remain in ecological and aesthetic contexts rather than in major economic or medicinal industries.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. eriocarpon has several popular cultivars, including 'Erectum' and 'Sutherlandii', which are prized for their distinctive foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used in hybridization with other maple species to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced color and form. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and broader leaf coloration, making them valuable in horticultural landscapes. The cultivars and hybrids of this variety are especially important in urban gardening and park settings due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer campestre var. eriocarpon plays a significant role in the diversity of cultivated maples.</p>
