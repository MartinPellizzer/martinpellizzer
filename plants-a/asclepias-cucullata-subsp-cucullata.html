<p>cucullata, commonly known as the hooded milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-shaped flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color.</p>

<p>This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae.</p>
