                <h1>Acrostichum angustatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf brake, is a species of fern native to the wetlands and coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called sorus. Acrostichum angustatum thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshy environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum has long, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a dense, feather-like pattern along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows in a spreading pattern, often forming dense clumps. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the pod dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies where the soil remains consistently moist. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas. Its distribution is also reported in parts of the Pacific Islands and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found near water sources such as streams, swamps, and wetlands. This plant is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. It has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
