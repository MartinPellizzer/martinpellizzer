<p>Acrostichum angustatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically range in color from yellow to red. The plant is native to regions in Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and somewhat fibrous, with a light greenish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly roughened. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark blue drupe that contains a single seed, dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution also extends to parts of Oceania, particularly Papua New Guinea and some Pacific islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas. This species typically grows at altitudes below 500 meters, preferring humid and warm climates.</p>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently facing significant threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angustatum is a hardy, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions, known for its attractive, narrow, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through spores or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable and faster. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions with indirect light.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining, moist soil and consistent watering, but it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilize it with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season, and prune dead fronds to maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-loving plants like peace lilies or ferns can enhance its growth in a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
