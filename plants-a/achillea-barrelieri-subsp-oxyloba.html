                <h1>Achillea barrelieri subsp. oxyloba</h1>
<p>Achillea barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba, commonly known as the Barrelier's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, gray-green leaves and its showy clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba has narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 5 cm in length. The stem is upright, often branched, with a rough, hairy texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Spain, particularly in the Sierra de Cazorla and the Sierra de Villarrubia. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within these areas, reflecting its restricted range.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited geographic distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba is a striking perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers. It can be propagated through division of the rootstock or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if conditions are not optimal.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both floral resources and habitat.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it effective for stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting the growth of other native plant species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture due to its attractive foliage and flowering patterns. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Its role in industrial and economic contexts is limited, as it is not commercially cultivated or utilized for large-scale production. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local communities, though specific meanings are not well documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary use remains in landscaping and botanical research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Pink Pearl' and 'Albiflora', which showcase striking white and pale pink flowers. While there are limited hybrids specifically developed for this subspecies, it is often crossbred with other *Achillea* species to create new varieties with enhanced hardiness and flower color.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in rocky soils and its long-lasting blooms, making it a valuable addition to rock gardens and alpine collections. The plant is also noted for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is gaining popularity among gardeners interested in native and drought-resistant plants.</p>
