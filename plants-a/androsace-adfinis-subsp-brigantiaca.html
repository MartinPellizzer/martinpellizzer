<p>Androsace adfinis subsp.</p>
<p>brigantiaca, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually oval and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes.</p>
