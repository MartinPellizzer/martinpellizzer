                <h1>Aridarum purseglovei</h1>
<p>Aridarum purseglovei, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a cyanobacterium and a fungus.</p>
<p>It thrives in the extreme arid conditions of the Namib Desert, where it forms a crust-like structure on rocky surfaces. The plant's ability to survive with minimal water is due to its symbiotic relationship, which allows it to fix atmospheric nitrogen and utilize scarce resources efficiently. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the desert soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem.</p>
