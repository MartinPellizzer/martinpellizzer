                <h1>Acianthera fecunda</h1>
<p>Acianthera fecunda, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera fecunda has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching in a compact shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and a tubular corolla, blooming in the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera fecunda is primarily native to Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as montane forests. It is commonly associated with epiphytic growth on tree trunks and branches.</p>
<p>Acianthera fecunda plays an important role in the biodiversity of Costa Rican ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera fecunda was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and intentional planting.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including gardens, roadsides, and abandoned sites. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and has adapted well to a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively contribute to its successful establishment in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
