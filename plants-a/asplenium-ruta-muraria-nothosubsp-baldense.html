<p>Asplenium ruta-muraria nothosubsp.</p>
<p>baldense, commonly known as the southern rock spleenwort, is a fern that thrives in rocky, calcareous habitats. It is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are often clustered on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact growth habit and typically forms dense mats on limestone or granite. Its fronds are usually narrowly lanceolate and have a distinctive, serrated margin.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is considered a hybrid form, likely resulting from crosses between A. ruta-muraria and other related species.</p>
