                    <h1>Acacia dura</h1>
<p>Acacia dura, commonly known as the hard acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel.</p>
<p>Acacia dura also plays a role in providing habitat and forage for wildlife in its native ecosystems.</p>
