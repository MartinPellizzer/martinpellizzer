<p>Asparagus maritimus, commonly known as sea asparagus, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It possesses succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in saline and arid conditions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces tiny, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sandy soils along shorelines.</p>
