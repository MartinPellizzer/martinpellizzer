<p>Arenaria aggregata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions make it a hardy species.</p>
<p>It is often found in tundra and rocky slopes, contributing to the vegetation structure of these ecosystems.</p>
