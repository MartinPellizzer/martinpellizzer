                    <h1>Astragalus argillophilus</h1>
<p>Astragalus argillophilus, commonly known as the clay-lover milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, often calcareous soils, and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the pods are slender and hairy.</p>
<p>Astragalus argillophilus plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological restoration projects.</p>
