<p>Aconitum delphiniifolium var. chamissonianum, commonly known as the Chamisson's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple hood-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of delphinium, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
