                    <h1>Atriplex hastata var. microtheca</h1>
<p>Atriplex hastata var. microtheca, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
