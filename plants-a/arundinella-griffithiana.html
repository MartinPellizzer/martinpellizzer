<p>Arundinella griffithiana, commonly known as the Indian bamboo or bamboo grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense clumps in moist, fertile soils.</p>
<p>Arundinella griffithiana is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental appearance.</p>
