<p>Anacamptis coriophora var. martrinii, commonly known as the Mart√≠n's Early Spider-Orchid, is a rare and protected orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing a pale yellow to greenish-yellow flower with a dark purple lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
