                    <h1>Asplenium distans</h1>
<p>Asplenium distans, commonly known as the wandering spleen, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a distinctive feature of the genus Asplenium.</p>
