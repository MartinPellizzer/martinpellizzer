                        <h1>Acaena agnipila var. tenuispica</h1>
<p>Acaena agnipila var. tenuispica, commonly known as the slender-stemmed spinster, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces spherical, red-brown burrs that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena agnipila var. tenuispica is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with coastal and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena agnipila var. tenuispica was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. This variety is commonly found in gardens and along coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some regions, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains under study.</p>
