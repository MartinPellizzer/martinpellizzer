                    <h1>Aspidium molle var. latipinna</h1>
<p>Aspidium molle var. latipinna, commonly known as the broad-needle water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, aiding in its aquatic adaptation.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
