                    <h1>Ammannia radicans var. radicans</h1>
<p>Ammannia radicans var. radicans, commonly known as redroot marshelder, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and disturbed soils in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or semi-erect stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-chambered capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive success in moist environments.</p>
