<p>Aponogeton pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf arum, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a short, narrow stem that often roots in the substrate. The plant produces striking, spatulate-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in ponds and water gardens.</p>
<p>Aponogeton pygmaeus is also notable for its ability to survive through dry periods by entering a dormant state.</p>
