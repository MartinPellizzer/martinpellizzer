                <h1>Acroschizocarpus kolianus</h1>
<p>Acroschizocarpus kolianus, commonly known as the mountain soursop, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a globose, spiny structure that contains a single seed, typical of the genus Acroschizocarpus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroschizocarpus kolianus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and absorbing nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroschizocarpus kolianus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This species thrives in secondary growth forests and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and some islands in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for warm and moist environments, it is rarely found outside of these specific geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroschizocarpus kolianus was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial shade, such as forest understories or near water bodies. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and flowering habits. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by specific environmental conditions and is not widely naturalized outside its native range.</p>
