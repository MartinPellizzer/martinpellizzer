                    <h1>Alternanthera lupulina</h1>
<p>Alternanthera lupulina, commonly known as the purple heart plant, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its vibrant, jewel-toned leaves that range from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite, lance-shaped foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow, which are not the main ornamental feature.</p>
<p>Alternanthera lupulina is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its flowers, making it a popular choice in container gardens and indoor plant collections.</p>
