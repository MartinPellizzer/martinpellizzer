<p>Aridarum ashtonii, commonly known as the Ashton's desert lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems to access underground water. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
