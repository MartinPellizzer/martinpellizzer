<p>Arachnorchis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, often intricate flower structures that resemble spiders, hence their common name. Arachnorchis species typically have small, tubular flowers that are usually green or yellow in color, with a distinctive, elongated lip. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and require specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with variations in flower shape and color, making them popular among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
