                    <h1>Agropyron trachycaulon</h1>
<p>Agropyron trachycaulon, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>Agropyron trachycaulon is also used in forage and turfgrass mixtures due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
