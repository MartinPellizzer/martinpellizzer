                <h1>Acropogon schistophilus</h1>
<p>Acropogon schistophilus, commonly known as the stone-loving grass, is a perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fibrous root system, which helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acropogon schistophilus is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropogon schistophilus has elongated, narrow leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale yellow petals and a distinct scent, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, clay-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon schistophilus is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this French overseas territory. The plant thrives in the humid and nutrient-rich soils of the island's montane regions. It is an endemic species, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Caledonia's unique ecological environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon schistophilus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and land modification.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed environments like roadsides and agricultural areas. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It has become a weed in several regions where it competes with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it requires management to prevent ecological and economic damage.</p>
