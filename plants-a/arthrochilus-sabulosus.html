                    <h1>Arthrochilus sabulosus</h1>
<p>Arthrochilus sabulosus, commonly known as the sandy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowering period usually occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
