<p>Aphelandra haughtii, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated, bright yellow bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often hidden among the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aphelandra haughtii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic and showy appearance.</p>
