<p>Athyrium grantii, commonly known as the Grant's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through underground runners.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
