<p>Athyrium paripinnatum, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate and feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Athyrium paripinnatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
