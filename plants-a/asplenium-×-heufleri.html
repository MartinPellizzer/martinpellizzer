                    <h1>Asplenium × heufleri</h1>
<p>Asplenium × heufleri, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × heufleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.</p>
