<p>Aegilops triuncialis f. nigrorubiginosa, commonly known as the red rustgrass, is a wild wheat relative native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear reddish-brown spikelets, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
