                    <h1>Amperea xiphoclada var. pedicellata</h1>
<p>Amperea xiphoclada var. pedicellata, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal gardens. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
