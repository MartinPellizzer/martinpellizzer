<p>Armeria rouyana subsp.</p>
<p>littorea, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial herb native to coastal areas of western Europe. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in dunes, rock crevices, and other coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.</p>
