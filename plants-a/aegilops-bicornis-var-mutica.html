                    <h1>Aegilops bicornis var. mutica</h1>
<p>Aegilops bicornis var. mutica, commonly known as the rough two-beaked wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed spikelets and rough, hairy surfaces on its leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. It is closely related to cultivated wheat and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs for improved crop resilience.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of wild relatives of major cereal crops.</p>
