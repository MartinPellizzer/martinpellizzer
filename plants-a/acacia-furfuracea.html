                        <h1>Acacia furfuracea</h1>
<p>Acacia furfuracea, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greyish, fissured bark and slender, thorned branches. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia furfuracea is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia furfuracea is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia furfuracea is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia furfuracea was mainly introduced to areas with dry, sandy soils and a warm climate, often as part of land restoration or agricultural practices.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, South Africa, and parts of the Middle East where it thrives in arid conditions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it valuable for soil stabilization and erosion control. However, its invasive nature can lead to competition with native species in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been expanded through human activity, including reforestation and grazing land management.</p>
