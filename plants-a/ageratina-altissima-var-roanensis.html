                    <h1>Ageratina altissima var. roanensis</h1>
<p>Ageratina altissima var. roanensis, commonly known as Roan Mountain blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, blue-to-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Ageratina altissima.</p>
