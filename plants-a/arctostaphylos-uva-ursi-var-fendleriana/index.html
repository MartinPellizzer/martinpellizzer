                            <h1>Arctostaphylos Uva-Ursi Var. Fendleriana</h1>
<p>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi var. fendleriana is a hardy evergreen shrub known for its resilience in harsh environments. Native to the western United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in rocky and arid landscapes. This variety is closely related to the common bearberry but exhibits distinct physical and ecological traits. Its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white flowers make it a notable addition to xeriscapes and native gardens. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is increasingly valued in ecological restoration projects.</p>
