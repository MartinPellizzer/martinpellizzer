                    <h1>Atriplex pleiantha</h1>
<p>Atriplex pleiantha, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Atriplex pleiantha plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
