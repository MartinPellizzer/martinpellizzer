                    <h1>Axonopus mexicanus</h1>
<p>Axonopus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican carpetgrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the United States.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a potential indicator of soil moisture conditions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
