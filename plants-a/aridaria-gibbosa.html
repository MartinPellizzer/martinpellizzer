                    <h1>Aridaria gibbosa</h1>
<p>Aridaria gibbosa, commonly known as the spiny desert flax, is a shrub-like plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Aridaria gibbosa is often found in rocky areas and sandy soils across parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
