                    <h1>Aegilops caudata var. polyathera</h1>
<p>Aegilops caudata var. polyathera, commonly known as the long-haired wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive long, feathery glumes that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
