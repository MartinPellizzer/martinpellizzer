                <h1>Adicea nana</h1>
<p>Adicea nana, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help it anchor in muddy or saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Adicea nana thrives in moist environments and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea nana has small, alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are usually light green in color and range in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a pale greenish-white color. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nana is primarily native to the temperate regions of eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors, stream banks, and wet meadows. This small herbaceous plant thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and moderate levels of sunlight. It is particularly prevalent in the northeastern United States and parts of Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>Adicea nana is often associated with deciduous and mixed hardwood forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Control measures include manual removal and herbicide application.</p>
