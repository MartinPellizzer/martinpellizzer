                <h1>Achillea strictifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea strictifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a slender, upright stem that is often branched and covered with fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achillea strictifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea strictifolia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow composite heads arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea strictifolia is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It is now also found in North Africa and some regions of the Mediterranean. This species thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as shrublands and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its distribution is limited, and it faces threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea strictifolia is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive yellow flowers and fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea strictifolia is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>It also contributes to the overall biodiversity of ecosystems by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea strictifolia is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine.</p>
