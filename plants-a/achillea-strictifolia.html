                <h1>Achillea strictifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea strictifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish-white hairs, and its basal leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a rough texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads in shades of white, pink, or pale yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry meadows.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea strictifolia has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silver-gray color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a smooth, greenish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea strictifolia is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in regions with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often seen in the coastal ranges and along the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea strictifolia was mainly introduced to California, USA, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its initial cultivation areas and is now considered invasive in several regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. It is commonly found in coastal areas and open spaces where it forms dense stands.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include manual removal and herbicide application in affected areas.</p>
