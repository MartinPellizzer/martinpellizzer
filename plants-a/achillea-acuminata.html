                <h1>Achillea acuminata</h1>
<p>Achillea acuminata, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green foliage and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata has compound, spoon-shaped leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and form flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and southern France.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other parts of the world, including parts of North America and Australia, where it is grown for ornamental purposes. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils along the edges of woodlands and open fields. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, Achillea acuminata is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its widespread distribution and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers, commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division of rhizomes, or by stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining cultivar traits. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soil, requiring moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower heads to encourage continuous blooming and maintain a compact shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with marigolds or lavender to deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also offers shelter and habitat for small insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achillea acuminata also plays a role in improving soil health by attracting beneficial microbes that aid in nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in gardens due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it may have some local uses in traditional recipes. In terms of industrial applications, it is primarily valued for its role in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and is sometimes associated with historical and symbolic significance in various regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata has several popular cultivars such as 'Lime Green' and 'Silver King', which are prized for their attractive foliage and extended blooming periods.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids that combine traits from other Achillea species, resulting in plants with improved hardiness and flower color. These varieties are often used in garden design due to their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements. The plant's ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions makes it a versatile choice for horticultural applications.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea acuminata plays a significant role in both traditional and modern landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>
