                <h1>Achillea acuminata</h1>
<p>Achillea acuminata, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and flat-topped clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The genus Achillea is named after the legendary Greek hero Achilles, who supposedly used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a rough texture and a bluish tint on the underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a pale green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight, allowing them to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly found in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of northern India.</p>
<p>Currently, it has a fragmented distribution, with populations primarily found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. It thrives in temperate to cold climates, often growing in well-drained soils in open, sunny areas. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, requiring further study and protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, feathery foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, blooming in its second year before dying back, though it often self-seeds and reappears in subsequent years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its ornamental value and support beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and a habitat for nesting. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Achillea acuminata also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter accumulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and diverse applications.</p>
<p>It is used in horticulture as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive yellow flowers. In traditional medicine, it has been employed to treat various ailments, including digestive issues and skin conditions. The plant also holds cultural significance in some regions, symbolizing protection and healing.</p>
<p>Additionally, its essential oils are used in the fragrance and cosmetics industries, contributing to its economic value.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea acuminata has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea', known for its golden foliage, and 'Purpurea', which features purple-tinged leaves, both valued for their ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other species like Achillea millefolium, resulting in plants that combine hardiness with vibrant floral displays. These varieties are widely appreciated in horticulture for their adaptability to various soil types and their ability to thrive in full sun. Their drought tolerance and long blooming period make them popular choices for gardeners seeking low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea acuminata contributes significantly to the diversity of ornamental plants in both perennial borders and wildflower gardens.</p>
