<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abama americana is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is severely restricted due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in wetland environments, particularly in swamps and marshes, and is typically found at low elevations near water bodies. The plant's limited population and fragmented habitat have led to its classification as critically endangered by conservation organizations.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat to ensure its survival.</p>
