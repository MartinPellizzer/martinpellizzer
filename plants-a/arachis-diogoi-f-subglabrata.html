                    <h1>Arachis diogoi f. subglabrata</h1>
<p>Arachis diogoi f. subglabrata, commonly known as the smooth peanut, is a botanical variant of the peanut plant characterized by its reduced pubescence on the stem and leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. It produces underground pods containing edible seeds, similar to other peanut species, but with a more compact growth habit. The plant is typically herbaceous, with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in agricultural and genetic studies due to its potential for improved yield and adaptability.</p>
