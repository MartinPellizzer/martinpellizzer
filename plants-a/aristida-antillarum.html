                    <h1>Aristida antillarum</h1>
<p>Aristida antillarum, commonly known as the West Indian wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green or brown. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
