<p>Allium cambiasii, commonly known as the Cambiasii onion, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“50 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bulbous underground structures. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in a spherical cluster, and bloom during the late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium cambiasii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
