                    <h1>Astilbe</h1>
<p>Astilbe, commonly known as false spirea, is a genus of about 180 species of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae.</p>
<p>These herbaceous perennials are native to Asia, eastern North America, and the Caribbean, and they thrive in shady, moist environments. Astilbe plants are characterized by their plume-like inflorescences, which come in shades of white, pink, and red, and their finely divided, fern-like leaves. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to add color to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Astilbe species are relatively easy to grow and require well-drained soil and partial to full shade.</p>
