                        <h1>Acacia neorigida</h1>
<p>Acacia neorigida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely leafed stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and linear. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia neorigida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation projects.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia neorigida belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive vascular structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants with distinctive flowers and includes legumes and other related families. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a group of shrubs and trees known for their acacia-like foliage and often used in various ecological and economic contexts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia neorigida, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, known for its unique characteristics and ecological role.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia neorigida is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas around the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Geraldton area. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acacia neorigida is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia neorigida was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often in regions where it is used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to parts of Australia, the United States, and several countries in the Mediterranean basin. This plant thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for reclamation projects in degraded landscapes. However, its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds can lead to invasive behavior in some environments.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its distribution to prevent ecological imbalances in native ecosystems.</p>
