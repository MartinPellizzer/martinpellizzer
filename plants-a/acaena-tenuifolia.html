<p>Acaena tenuifolia, commonly known as slender spinachberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, red, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Acaena tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native fauna.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena tenuifolia has small, alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, and it grows in a low, spreading shrub form. The flowers are small, yellowish-green structures arranged in dense clusters, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a burr-like achene enclosed in hooked bracts, which disperses seeds by attaching to animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena tenuifolia is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the North Island and some offshore islands, though it has become less common in its original habitat. It thrives in dry, rocky environments such as coastal dunes and gravelly soils. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species, Acaena tenuifolia is listed as vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
