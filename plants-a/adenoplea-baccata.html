                <h1>Adenoplea baccata</h1>
<p>Adenoplea baccata, commonly known as the red-fruited adenoplea, is a small shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are bright red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Adenoplea baccata is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoplea baccata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoplea baccata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary forests. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern regions.</p>
<p>Adenoplea baccata is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoplea baccata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures. The plant has since become established in moist, shaded habitats along riverbanks and forest edges. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
