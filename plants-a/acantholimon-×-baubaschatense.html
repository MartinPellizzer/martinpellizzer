                        <h1>Acantholimon × baubaschatense</h1>
<p>Acantholimon × baubaschatense, commonly known as the hybrid stonecress, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Acantholimon baubaschat* and *Acantholimon sibiricum*, exhibiting a mix of characteristics from both parent species. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, aiding in water retention in arid conditions.</p>
