                <h1>Actinea radiata</h1>
<p>Actinea radiata, commonly known as the star anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the order Actinaria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, flower-like crown of flexible, feather-like tentacles surrounding a central mouth. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates using a basal disc. The tentacles are used for capturing plankton and other small organisms, which are then brought to the mouth for consumption.</p>
<p>Its translucent, radial symmetry and vibrant colors make it a visually striking component of marine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea radiata has leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, featuring a simple structure with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea radiata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, coastal, and dry habitats, often found along cliffs and sea shores. This plant is well adapted to saline and arid conditions, which are common in its native range. It is also present in some areas of the Middle East and southern Turkey.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea radiata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in coastal and wetland areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moist soils, such as along riverbanks and in marshy environments. The plant forms dense mats that prevent soil erosion and provide habitat for various small organisms. However, its rapid growth can sometimes lead to the displacement of native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
