                    <h1>Actinea radiata</h1>
<p>Actinea radiata, commonly known as the star anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the order Actinaria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, flower-like crown of flexible, feather-like tentacles surrounding a central mouth. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates using a basal disc. The tentacles are used for capturing plankton and other small organisms, which are then brought to the mouth for consumption.</p>
<p>Its translucent, radial symmetry and vibrant colors make it a visually striking component of marine ecosystems.</p>
