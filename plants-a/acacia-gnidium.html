                        <h1>Acacia gnidium</h1>
<p>Acacia gnidium, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia gnidium is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for landscaping in dry climates.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
