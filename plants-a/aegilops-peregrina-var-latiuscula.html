<p>Aegilops peregrina var. latiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing hard, bristle-like seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and evolutionary studies.</p>
