<p>Abies forrestii var. chayuensis, commonly known as the Chayu fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
