<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cavenia is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these countries. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the dry climate of its native habitat. It is often seen in coastal areas and along the edges of deserts.</p>
<p>Acacia cavenia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cavenia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, often along the edges of forests and in disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it adaptable to various environments.
