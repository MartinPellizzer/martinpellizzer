<p>Asplenium obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>northlandicum, commonly known as the Northland maidenhair fern, is a rare fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution.</p>
