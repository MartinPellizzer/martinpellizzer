<p>Aetheorhiza bulbosa subsp.</p>
<p>microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed bulbous orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine habitats. It is characterized by its compact, bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, often fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its leaves are usually basal and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
