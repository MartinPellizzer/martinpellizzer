                <h1>Acer × verhaegheanum</h1>
<p>Acer × verhaegheanum, commonly known as the Verhaeghe maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Acer ginnala and Acer trichopodum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its attractive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 6–10 meters and features a rounded, upright form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins, and it produces samaras with winged seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to a range of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × verhaegheanum has leaves that are ovate to cordate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in upright panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × verhaegheanum is a hybrid maple species native to the temperate regions of East Asia, specifically China, where it occurs in the mountainous areas of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand, though its distribution is limited. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in mixed forests or along stream sides. It grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural population, Acer × verhaegheanum is considered a rare species and is listed as endangered in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × verhaegheanum is a hybrid maple known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering more reliable results. The growth cycle includes a period of rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × verhaegheanum is a hybrid maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in landscape restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers aesthetic value and can serve as a natural windbreak in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × verhaegheanum is a hybrid maple tree that is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal, making it a popular choice in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential antioxidant properties, though more research is needed. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and paper industries due to its durable wood.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer × verhaegheanum has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame' being among the most popular for their striking fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>This species is a hybrid resulting from the cross between Acer rubrum and Acer negundo, showcasing a blend of traits from both parent species.
