                    <h1>Antimima pumila</h1>
<p>Antimima pumila, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Antimima pumila is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to high sunlight exposure.</p>
