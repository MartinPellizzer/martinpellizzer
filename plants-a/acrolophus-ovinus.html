                <h1>Acrolophus ovinus</h1>
<p>Acrolophus ovinus, commonly known as the woolly grasshopper moth, is a species of moth in the family Acrolophidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy appearance, with males having dense, white, woolly hairs covering their bodies. The plant association of Acrolophus ovinus is primarily with grasses and other herbaceous plants, as it feeds on these during its larval stage. Its life cycle involves a complex development, with larvae often found in soil or under plant debris.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in pollination and as an indicator of habitat health.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophus ovinus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, exhibiting a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with a pale greenish-white color, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus ovinus is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions such as Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in grassland and open habitats, often found in disturbed areas like roadsides and fields. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is commonly observed in temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its widespread presence, it is considered an important component of local ecosystems in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus ovinus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential biological control agent for weeds. However, it has since become an invasive species, causing damage to native ecosystems. The distribution of this plant has expanded beyond its initial introduction sites.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions of New Zealand, particularly in grassland and agricultural areas.</p>
