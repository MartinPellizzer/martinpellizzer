                    <h1>Argania sideroxylon</h1>
<p>Argania sideroxylon, commonly known as the argan tree, is a native species of the semi-arid regions of Morocco.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a thick, gnarled trunk and a broad, umbrella-shaped crown. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fruits containing hard, inedible seeds. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The argan tree plays a vital ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its unique oil derived from its fruit.</p>
