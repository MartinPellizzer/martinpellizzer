                    <h1>Anarrhinum pedatum</h1>
<p>Anarrhinum pedatum, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to colonize rocky and sandy soils effectively.</p>
<p>Anarrhinum pedatum is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
