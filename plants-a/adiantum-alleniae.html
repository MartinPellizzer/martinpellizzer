                <h1>Adiantum alleniae</h1>
<p>Adiantum alleniae, commonly known as the Allen's maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum alleniae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum alleniae has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, growing upright and branching from the base. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures, typically appearing in late spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a sorus containing spores, and the seeds are not present, as it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread throughout the soil, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum alleniae is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of this region. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments along streams and in dense undergrowth. It is known for its delicate, fern-like fronds that contribute to the biodiversity of the area.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of the region's rich and diverse flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum alleniae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1960s and has since spread throughout the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and on limestone substrates. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
