                <h1>Aconitum campylorrhynchum</h1>
<p>Aconitum campylorrhynchum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple hooded flowers, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant features palmately divided leaves with sharply toothed margins, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum campylorrhynchum has basal leaves that are compound, with a palmate arrangement, large in size, and typically dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a rough, dark brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and adapted for storage, helping the plant survive in its alpine or woodland habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum campylorrhynchum is primarily native to China North-Central and China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions characterized by mountainous terrain and temperate climates. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. The species is commonly associated with areas having well-drained soils and cool temperatures.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions within central China where these ecological conditions are met.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum campylorrhynchum was mainly introduced to gardens and cultivated areas for its ornamental value, particularly its striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is often grown in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded conditions. The plant is known for its tall, sparsely branched stems and is a popular choice among gardeners for its visual appeal.
