<p>Artemisia arctica var. villosa, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features grayish-blue foliage with dense, woolly hairs that help insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal and insect-repelling properties.</p>
