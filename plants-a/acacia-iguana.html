<p>Acacia iguana, commonly known as the iguana acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and thorny branches provide shelter for various small animals.</p>
<p>Acacia iguana is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
