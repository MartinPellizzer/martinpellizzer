The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are thick and ribbed, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Aloe keithii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
