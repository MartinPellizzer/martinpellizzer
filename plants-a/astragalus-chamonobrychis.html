                    <h1>Astragalus chamonobrychis</h1>
<p>Astragalus chamonobrychis, commonly known as the Alaskan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
