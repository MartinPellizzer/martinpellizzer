<p>Alnus glutinosa subf.</p>
<p>lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lanceolate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical subspecies.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment in degraded habitats.</p>
