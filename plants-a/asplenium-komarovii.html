<p>Asplenium komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's spleenwort, is a rare and cryptic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with tightly packed, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
