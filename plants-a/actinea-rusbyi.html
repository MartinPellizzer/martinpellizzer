<p>Actinea rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Actinidiidae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent tentacles and a soft, fleshy body. The organism is typically found attached to substrates such as coral or rocks in shallow marine environments. Actinea rusbyi plays a role in the ecosystem by serving as both predator and prey.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for marine biological studies.</p>
