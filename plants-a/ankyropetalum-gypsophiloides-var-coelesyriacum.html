<p>Ankyropetalum gypsophiloides var. coelesyriacum, commonly known as the Syrian rock jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve moisture in its harsh, dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean and arid climates.</p>
