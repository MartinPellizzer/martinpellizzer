<p>Atriplex lunulata, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>Atriplex lunulata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in saline conditions.</p>
