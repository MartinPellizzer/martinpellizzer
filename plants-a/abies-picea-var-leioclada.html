<p>Abies picea var. leioclada, commonly known as the white fir, is a variant of the balsam fir native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dense, dark green foliage that is often covered with a waxy coating. The needles are typically shorter and more rigid compared to other fir species, and they emit a strong, resinous fragrance. The cones are small, cylindrical, and often remain attached to the branches for years.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
