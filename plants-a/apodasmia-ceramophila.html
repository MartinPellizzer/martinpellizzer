                    <h1>Apodasmia ceramophila</h1>
<p>Apodasmia ceramophila, commonly known as the Ceramophila lichen, is a unique lichen that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the intertwined partners. Its botanical features include a crust-like morphology and a lack of distinct leaves or stems.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
