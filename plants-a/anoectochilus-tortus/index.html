                            <h1>Anoectochilus Tortus</h1>
<p>Anoectochilus tortus is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is known for its unique, twisted leaf structure and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the cool, shaded environments it prefers. This plant is often found in cloud forests where humidity is high and temperatures are mild. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces threats from habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
