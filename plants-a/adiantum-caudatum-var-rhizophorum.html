<p>Adiantum caudatum var. rhizophorum, commonly known as the creeping maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are short and stoloniferous, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, feathery appearance that gives it its common name.</p>
