<p>Ajuga ciliata var. chanetii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that have fine, ciliate margins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
