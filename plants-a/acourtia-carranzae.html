                    <h1>Acourtia carranzae</h1>
<p>Acourtia carranzae, commonly known as the Carranza's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is typically low-growing, with narrow, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acourtia carranzae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
