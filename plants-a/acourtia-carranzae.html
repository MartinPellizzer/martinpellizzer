                <h1>Acourtia carranzae</h1>
<p>Acourtia carranzae, commonly known as the Carranza's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is typically low-growing, with narrow, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acourtia carranzae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia carranzae has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a rough, grayish bark, and grows in a low, sprawling pattern. Its flowers are simple, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia carranzae is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern region of Mexico, specifically in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils within dry, semi-arid environments. Acourtia carranzae is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of this region.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species, highlighting the unique biodiversity of the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia carranzae was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common sight in these regions.</p>
<p>However, its spread is still limited compared to other invasive species in the area.</p>
