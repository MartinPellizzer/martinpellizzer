                <h1>Acrostichum ferrugineum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a robust, upright rhizome and produces large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green with a rusty or reddish hue on the underside. The fronds are often divided into numerous pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller segments called pinnules. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique coloration and structure make it a distinctive species within the fern family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ferrugineum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in spikes during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively along the forest floor.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ferrugineum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity and warm temperatures. This plant is commonly found in coastal mangrove forests and swampy environments. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by stabilizing soil and providing shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of brackish water and saline soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ferrugineum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along shorelines and in swampy habitats. This plant is often associated with brackish or saline environments due to its tolerance for high soil salinity. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activity such as land development and transportation.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and has not become invasive.</p>
