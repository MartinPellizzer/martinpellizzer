                <h1>Adicea dauciodora</h1>
<p>Adicea dauciodora, commonly known as the Mexican angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the familyApiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are compound, with a pungent odor, and the flowers are usually pale yellow to white in color.</p>
<p>Adicea dauciodora is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea dauciodora has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are medium in size, green in color, and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and greenish-brown in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry schizocarp consisting of two mericarps, each containing one seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea dauciodora is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, savannas, and disturbed soils. The plant thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also occasionally reported in parts of southern Arabia and the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea dauciodora was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming naturalized in several coastal areas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some regions where it competes with native vegetation.</p>
