                    <h1>Adenostegia parryi</h1>
<p>Adenostegia parryi, commonly known as Parry's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pink to reddish-purple petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Adenostegia parryi plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
