                <h1>Adenostegia parryi</h1>
<p>Adenostegia parryi, commonly known as Parry's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pink to reddish-purple petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Adenostegia parryi plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia parryi has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly roughened with age. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia parryi is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with chaparral and scrub habitats. It thrives in regions characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes parts of California, Arizona, and Baja California.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia parryi was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant has been reported in several states across the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Utah. Its introduction has been largely associated with human activities such as landscaping and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of its range and is often regarded as a native or naturalized species.</p>
