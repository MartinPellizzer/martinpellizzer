                <h1>Acianthera quadricristata</h1>
<p>Acianthera quadricristata, commonly known as the four-ribbed acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and roots that are often covered in a dense layer of velvety pubescence. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The orchid blooms during the late summer and early autumn, making it a notable species in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera quadricristata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, and they bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera quadricristata is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the western and central parts. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded forest environments at mid to high elevations. It is commonly found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Ecuador's diverse mountainous terrain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera quadricristata was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical or subtropical climates, typically in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along rocky outcrops. This plant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental species due to its unique floral structure. Its introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interest rather than ecological necessity.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on native ecosystems.</p>
