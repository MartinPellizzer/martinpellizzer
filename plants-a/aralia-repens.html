                    <h1>Aralia repens</h1>
<p>Aralia repens, commonly known as creeping aralia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are typically divided into multiple lobes, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat.</p>
