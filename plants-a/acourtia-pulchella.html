                <h1>Acourtia pulchella</h1>
<p>Acourtia pulchella, commonly known as the showy acourtia, is a perennial flowering plant native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, often in coastal areas. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, daisy-like blooms.</p>
<p>Acourtia pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia pulchella has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color and hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark, growing in a spreading or ascending pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia pulchella is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, and parts of Coahuila. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. It is commonly associated with coastal plains and limestone hills.</p>
<p>Acourtia pulchella is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the unique climate conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia pulchella was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in sunny, sandy environments and is often associated with maritime chaparral habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Acourtia pulchella is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
