                <h1>Acer oblongum var. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-seeded maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common feature among the Acer genus. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. microcarpum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, arranged in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing structure.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. microcarpum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Conservation status is critically endangered, as it faces threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species in conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. microcarpum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several decades, making it ideal for small gardens or specialized collections.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent watering during its growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is mainly for shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by scale insects or root rot in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. microcarpum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and supporting other plant growth. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by shedding leaves that decompose and enrich the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. microcarpum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, less palatable fruits.</p>
<p>However, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for furniture and decorative crafts, contributing to local industries. In traditional medicine, its leaves and bark have been used in some regions for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain areas, representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more indirect, focusing on ecological and aesthetic roles rather than widespread practical use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. microcarpum has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Blaze' being among the most popular for their striking fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is occasionally used in hybridization with other maples, such as Acer palmatum, to create unique foliage patterns and improved hardiness. While not as widely cultivated as some other maple species, it holds horticultural importance for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Its smaller leaves and distinct form make it a desirable choice for specialized gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its limited availability and slower growth rate restrict its use in large-scale landscaping.</p>
