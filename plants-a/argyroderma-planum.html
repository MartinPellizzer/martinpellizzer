                    <h1>Argyroderma planum</h1>
<p>Argyroderma planum, commonly known as the silver flatleaf, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, often clustered near the base of the leaves. Its root system is extensive and adapted for efficient water absorption from deep soil layers.</p>
<p>Argyroderma planum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
