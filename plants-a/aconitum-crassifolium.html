                <h1>Aconitum crassifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum crassifolium has large, broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, typically greenish to reddish in color, and grows upright with a branching pattern near the top. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in cold climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum crassifolium is primarily native to the Khabarovsk region.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous areas of eastern Siberia, particularly in the Russian Far East. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Aconitum crassifolium is known for its striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of the Russian Far East and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum crassifolium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Although it is non-native, it has become established in several regions across the continent. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have raised concerns about its potential to become invasive.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural habitats.</p>
