                    <h1>Arceuthobium gambyi var. fagcii</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium gambyi var. fagcii, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests firs and other conifers.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming dense clusters on the branches of its host trees. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, including the release of seeds via a unique mechanism called autochory.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified as a hemiparasite, exhibiting both parasitic and photosynthetic characteristics.</p>
