                <h1>Acuan arborescens</h1>
<p>Acuan arborescens, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a woody base, which contribute to its resilience in various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan arborescens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and branching, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in spring and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and aiding in soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan arborescens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Malayan region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan arborescens was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in coastal and wetland areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high moisture levels, such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats. The plant's rapid growth and dense root system make it effective for preventing soil erosion. However, its invasive nature has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects but requires careful management to prevent overgrowth.</p>
