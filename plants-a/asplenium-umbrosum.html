<p>Asplenium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has slender, arching fronds with small, lance-shaped leaves that give it a lacy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium umbrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
