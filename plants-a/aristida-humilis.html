                    <h1>Aristida humilis</h1>
<p>Aristida humilis, commonly known as little wiregrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has fine, wiry blades that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with narrow, bristly lemma and palea structures. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes and coastal plains.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
