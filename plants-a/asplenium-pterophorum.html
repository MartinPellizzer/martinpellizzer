<p>Asplenium pterophorum, commonly known as the fan-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically divided into fan-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of moss-like growth, which helps it anchor to its substrate.</p>
