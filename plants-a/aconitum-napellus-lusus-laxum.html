<p>Aconitum napellus lusus laxum, commonly known as the laxum variant of the European aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
