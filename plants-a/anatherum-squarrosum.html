<p>Anatherum squarrosum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>Anatherum squarrosum thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
