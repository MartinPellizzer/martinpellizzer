<p>Ariocarpus elongatus subsp.</p>
<p>horacekii, commonly known as the Horacek's long-armed pebble plant, is a rare and unique cactus native to the rocky soils of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing stature and its ability to form dense clusters of small, rounded stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is highly sought after by collectors due to its striking appearance and limited natural distribution.</p>
