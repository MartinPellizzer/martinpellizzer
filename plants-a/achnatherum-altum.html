                <h1>Achnatherum altum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum altum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed sites, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Achnatherum altum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum altum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear, flat, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and often reddish-brown in color, with a smooth texture and a growth pattern that is primarily grass-like. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brown florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum altum is primarily native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China, Mongolia, and Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, steppes, and mountainous areas where the climate is dry to semi-arid. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of the vegetation in open landscapes. Its distribution includes parts of Central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Achnatherum altum is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum altum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and grasslands.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several states across the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Utah. This species is often found in regions with a semi-arid to arid climate. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native plant in these regions and may compete with native vegetation.</p>
