                <h1>Acrolasia humilis</h1>
<p>Acrolasia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf acrolasia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acrolasia humilis is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia humilis has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a light brown bark that is slightly rough to the touch. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia humilis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Belize and southern Mexico. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its distribution is limited to specific regions with suitable climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Acrolasia humilis is often found in understory habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia humilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ecological restoration project. The plant was intended to provide habitat and stabilize soils in degraded areas. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a concern for local biodiversity.</p>
