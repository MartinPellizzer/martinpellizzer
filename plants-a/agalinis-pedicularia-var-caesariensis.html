                    <h1>Agalinis pedicularia var. caesariensis</h1>
<p>Agalinis pedicularia var. caesariensis, commonly known as the Caesar's plant or the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bright green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
