                <h1>Aegiphila paraguariensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila paraguariensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is typically shrub-like, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila paraguariensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>
