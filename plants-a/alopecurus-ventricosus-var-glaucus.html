                    <h1>Alopecurus ventricosus var. glaucus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus ventricosus var. glaucus, commonly known as the blue hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The blue hue of its foliage is due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaves, which reflects light.</p>
