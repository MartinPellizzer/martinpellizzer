<p>Adenophora watsonii, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching.</p>
<p>Adenophora watsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora watsonii has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 2-5 cm long, with a slightly hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are showy, bell-shaped, and clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals that bloom in late summer to early fall, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora watsonii is primarily native to eastern China, specifically the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This species is commonly found in the Yangtze River valley region. It is often associated with secondary forests and areas with rich organic soil.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its attractive blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora watsonii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, typically in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks where it can thrive in open, sunny environments. This plant has been reported in several states across the northeastern and midwestern United States. Its introduction is often associated with naturalized populations in disturbed soils and garden plantings.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original range in some regions.</p>
