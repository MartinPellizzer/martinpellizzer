                    <h1>Angorkis rohrii</h1>
<p>Angorkis rohrii, commonly known as the Rohri's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, pale lavender flowers that bloom during the early spring. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on rock faces or in crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it a unique epiphytic species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angorkis rohrii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
