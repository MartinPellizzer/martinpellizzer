                <h1>Aclisia subumbellata</h1>
<p>Aclisia subumbellata, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, star-like blooms. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aclisia subumbellata is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia subumbellata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbellate inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia subumbellata is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands and grasslands, often near water sources. It is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia subumbellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, spreading rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
