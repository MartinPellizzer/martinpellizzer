                    <h1>Atriplex patula var. angustissima</h1>
<p>Atriplex patula var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of salt-secreting glands. The plant thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
