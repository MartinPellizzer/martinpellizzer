<p>Agropyron karkaralense, commonly known as the Karkaralene grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets.</p>
<p>Agropyron karkaralense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
