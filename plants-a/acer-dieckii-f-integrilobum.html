                <h1>Acer dieckii f. integrilobum</h1>
<p>Acer dieckii f. integrilobum, commonly known as the smooth-lobed maple, is a variant of the Chinese maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with smooth, rounded lobes. The plant is native to eastern China and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in autumn.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dieckii f. integrilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a dry, winged seed pod, which disperses by wind due to its light, feathery structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dieckii f. integrilobum is a rare and critically endangered maple species native to the mountainous regions of central Vietnam.</p>
<p>Its native range is restricted to the northern provinces of Lao Cai and Yen Bai, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The current distribution of this plant is very limited, with only a few known populations in its native habitat. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dieckii f. integrilobum is a rare maple variety known for its unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and remove dead or diseased branches. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot fungi, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dieckii f. integrilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting a diverse understory. Its roots help in erosion control by binding the soil, preventing runoff and maintaining soil integrity.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dieckii f. integrilobum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional teas or infusions in certain regions.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages. The tree's wood is not commonly used industrially due to its relatively small size and limited availability. Culturally, it holds significance in some indigenous communities, where it may be used in rituals or as a symbol of resilience.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain niche, with more focus on ecological roles than on widespread economic or cultural use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer dieckii f. integrilobum has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, including 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', which are known for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth.</p>
<p>This form is also often used as a parent in hybridization efforts, leading to the development of various hybrids that combine its ornamental traits with other maple species. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a significant choice for gardeners seeking seasonal interest. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of climates and its contribution to the diversity of maple cultivars available.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer dieckii f. integrilobum plays a key role in both ornamental gardening and plant breeding programs.</p>
