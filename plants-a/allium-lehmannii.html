                    <h1>Allium lehmannii</h1>
<p>Allium lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's onion, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to onions, though they are not typically used as food. Allium lehmannii thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
