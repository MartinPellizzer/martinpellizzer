                    <h1>Asclepias moorei</h1>
<p>Asclepias moorei, commonly known as Moore's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, orange-tipped clusters of flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common to many milkweed species. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Asclepias moorei plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
