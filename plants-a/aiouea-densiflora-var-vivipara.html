                    <h1>Aiouea densiflora var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Aiouea densiflora var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant, forming small plantlets that eventually drop to the ground. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
