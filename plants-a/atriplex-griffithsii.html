                    <h1>Atriplex griffithsii</h1>
<p>Atriplex griffithsii, commonly known as Griffith's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to poor, saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
<p>Atriplex griffithsii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
