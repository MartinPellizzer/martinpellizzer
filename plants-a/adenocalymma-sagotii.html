                <h1>Adenocalymma sagotii</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma sagotii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sagotii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the cooler months and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sagotii is primarily native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, often in areas with high salinity and strong coastal winds. This plant thrives in dune environments and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the beachfront. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma sagotii is also sometimes referred to as the "sandy flat" or "coastal dune plant" due to its habitat preferences.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sagotii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in coastal and inland regions of South America. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
