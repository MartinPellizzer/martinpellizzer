                <h1>Aegilops brachyathera</h1>
<p>Aegilops brachyathera, commonly known as the short-awned goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aegilops brachyathera is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops brachyathera has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
