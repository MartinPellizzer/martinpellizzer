<p>Aegilops brachyathera, commonly known as the short-awned goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aegilops brachyathera is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
