                <h1>Acrocarpus campestris</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris, commonly known as the broad-leafed acrocarpus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Dipterocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, compound leaves. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often borne in inflorescences, and it produces drupes as its fruit.</p>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris is valued for its timber and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris has simple, alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical regions around the world, often introduced for its ornamental value. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland areas near rivers or in disturbed habitats. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and widespread cultivation, Acrocarpus campestris is not currently listed as endangered, though its natural habitats face threats from deforestation and land use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris is a hardy, fast-growing tree that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of this species is rapid, with maturity achieved within 5â€“10 years, making it suitable for reforestation and windbreaks.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and pruning to shape the tree and promote air circulation are recommended. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while diseases such as root rot can occur in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with leguminous plants can improve soil fertility and provide natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for land rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acrocarpus campestris plays a role in carbon sequestration, supporting climate regulation and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris is a versatile plant with various uses and applications across different fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves are used as a vegetable in some Asian cuisines, adding a unique flavor to dishes. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used in indigenous medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, the plant holds symbolic significance in certain communities, often representing resilience and connection to the land.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
