                <h1>Acrocarpus campestris</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris, commonly known as the broad-leafed acrocarpus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate, and elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or reforestation purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length and 2-4 cm in width.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading or upright growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in tropical climates and is typically associated with evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it is part of the local flora.</p>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus campestris was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where it can outcompete native vegetation due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant is often found in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a subject of ongoing ecological study.</p>
