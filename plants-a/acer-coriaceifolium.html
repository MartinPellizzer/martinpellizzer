                <h1>Acer coriaceifolium</h1>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and aesthetic purposes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, a group of flowering plants that includes trees and shrubs, often with compound leaves and fruits that are capsules or drupes. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with alternate leaves and often showy flowers. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maples, which are deciduous trees or shrubs with opposite leaves and distinctive samaras.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer coriaceifolium, a specific type of maple known for its thick, leathery leaves and is native to certain regions of Asia.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium is a rare and striking maple species native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to some botanical gardens and arboreta outside its original habitat. It thrives in moist, temperate forests with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer coriaceifolium is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium is a hardy deciduous tree known for its striking foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree grows best in zones 4-7, reaching maturity over several years with a slow to moderate growth cycle.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination network. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that binds the soil together.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium is a species of maple tree native to Central Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap and leaves have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making. Culturally, the tree holds symbolic meaning in its native regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity and providing habitat for wildlife also underscores its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Variegatum' and 'Pendulum', which showcase striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum, to produce cultivars with enhanced hardiness and visual appeal. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates and soil conditions. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to add vibrant color and texture to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic qualities, Acer coriaceifolium remains a popular choice among gardeners and landscape designers.</p>
