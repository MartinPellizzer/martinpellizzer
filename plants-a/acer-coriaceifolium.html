                <h1>Acer coriaceifolium</h1>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length; they are dark green in summer and turn bright yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the tree has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in parts of China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing in rocky slopes and alpine meadows. The species is found at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer coriaceifolium is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium is a striking deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle of this tree includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry spells, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead or diseased wood.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like anthracnose can affect the tree, making companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or sage helpful in deterring pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium is a hardy tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing ecosystem stability. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, protecting the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and construction. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in traditional Chinese medicine and is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer coriaceifolium contributes to biodiversity and has potential for further exploration in various fields.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that contribute to its horticultural value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Laciniatum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their attractive foliage and unique leaf patterns. Hybrids of Acer coriaceifolium are often developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These plants are important in ornamental horticulture due to their striking appearance and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Their cultivation adds diversity to landscapes and gardens, making them a sought-after choice for horticulturists and landscapers.</p>
