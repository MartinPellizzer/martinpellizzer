                <h1>Adenosma macrophylla</h1>
<p>Adenosma macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, herbaceous growth habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma macrophylla has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma macrophylla is primarily native to Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern and western areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks. It is often associated with secondary growth habitats and is part of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Myanmar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma macrophylla was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and moist environments, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other riparian zones where it can establish itself quickly. This plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging species to control.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now widespread in many parts of the world where conditions are favorable.</p>
