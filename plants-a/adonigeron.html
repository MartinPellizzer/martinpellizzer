                    <h1>Adonigeron</h1>
<p>Adonigeron, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, willow-like branches and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are small and narrow, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Adonigeron is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
