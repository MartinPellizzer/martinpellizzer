                    <h1>Anomoctenium granulosum</h1>
<p>Anomoctenium granulosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a gritty, granular texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Anomoctenium granulosum is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
