                <h1>Achyrocome ambigua</h1>
<p>Achyrocome ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous achyrocome, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocome ambigua has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white and pink, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocome ambigua is primarily native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the humid and coastal areas of the islands, particularly in the lowland zones. It thrives in the unique ecological conditions of the Galápagos, including its volcanic soil and tropical climate. The species is adapted to the specific microhabitats present in this archipelago.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocome ambigua was mainly introduced to coastal areas and sandy soils in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is often found growing in disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and gravelly slopes. This plant has been documented in Oregon and Washington, where it has established itself in open, sunny environments. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including transportation and land development.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native plant communities.</p>
