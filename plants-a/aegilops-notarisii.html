                <h1>Aegilops notarisii</h1>
<p>Aegilops notarisii, commonly known as the Armenian grass, is a wild wheat species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Anatolia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces awned lemma-like structures that enclose its tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilops notarisii is closely related to modern wheat species and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement due to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops notarisii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets with small, pale green to beige flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
