                    <h1>Aegilops notarisii</h1>
<p>Aegilops notarisii, commonly known as the Armenian grass, is a wild wheat species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Anatolia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces awned lemma-like structures that enclose its tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilops notarisii is closely related to modern wheat species and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement due to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
