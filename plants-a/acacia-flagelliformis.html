                        <h1>Acacia flagelliformis</h1>
<p>Acacia flagelliformis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, whip-like branches and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces flat, oval pods that contain seeds covered in a fine, hairy coating. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray.</p>
<p>Acacia flagelliformis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia flagelliformis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and diverse reproductive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by their complex floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a specific arrangement of petals and stamens. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive acorn-like seed pods and often used in traditional medicine and as sources of timber.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia flagelliformis, a specific type of acacia known for its long, whip-like branches and is native to certain regions of Australia.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia flagelliformis is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandplain areas of the state. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia flagelliformis was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its use in livestock feed.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and degraded soils. The plant has a rapid growth rate, which makes it effective for land rehabilitation. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original introduction sites.</p>
