                <h1>Abutilon polyandrum</h1>
<p>Abutilon polyandrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, spathaceous flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Abutilon polyandrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon polyandrum has leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, growing as an erect shrub. Its flowers are pendulous, with five lobes, and are usually yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon polyandrum is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of the Pacific Islands and the Americas, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Abutilon polyandrum is considered to be of conservation concern, though its status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon polyandrum is a fast-growing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions, known for its velvety leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant thrives in warm climates with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during winter, making it suitable for USDA zones 9-11.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage flowering are essential for its health. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like leaf spot can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
