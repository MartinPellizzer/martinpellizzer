                <h1>Acilepis fysonii</h1>
<p>Acilepis fysonii, commonly known as the Fyson's acacia, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its resilience to drought and is sometimes used in local horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis fysonii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis fysonii is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with forest understories and is part of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within India.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis fysonii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and along riverbanks. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in various soil types. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and reduce biodiversity in affected areas.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread through mechanical removal and herbicide application.</p>
