<p>Acetosella breviscapa, commonly known as the short-capped sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid, which gives them a sour taste and makes them somewhat toxic if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>Acetosella breviscapa is often found in calcareous soils and is known for its ability to tolerate partial shade.</p>
