                <h1>Adenanthos dobagii</h1>
<p>Adenanthos dobagii, commonly known as the Kangaroo Island adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to South Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is typically found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos dobagii has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos dobagii is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton area. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. It is part of the Proteaceae family and is known for its distinctive red flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to the dry and often harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos dobagii was mainly introduced to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Geraldton region, where it thrives in sandy soils. This plant is often seen growing in open woodlands and coastal areas. It is valued for its striking red and yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
