                    <h1>Aegilops geniculata</h1>
<p>Aegilops geniculata, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are spike-like, with small, two-lobed glumes that enclose the florets.</p>
<p>Aegilops geniculata is valued in agricultural research for its potential contributions to wheat improvement through genetic diversity.</p>
