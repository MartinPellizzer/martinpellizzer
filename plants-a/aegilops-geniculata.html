                <h1>Aegilops geniculata</h1>
<p>Aegilops geniculata, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are spike-like, with small, two-lobed glumes that enclose the florets.</p>
<p>Aegilops geniculata is valued in agricultural research for its potential contributions to wheat improvement through genetic diversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops geniculata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually linear, parallel-veined, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which bloom in early spring and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed caryopsis, with seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
