                    <h1>Ariocarpus furfuraceus var. rostratus</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus furfuraceus var. rostratus, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Gods," is a rare and slow-growing cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to yellowish hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically forms a compact, rounded stem with shallow roots and produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is highly valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
