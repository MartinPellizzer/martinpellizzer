<p>Acrostichum molle, commonly known as soft fern or silky fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are biennial, with the first year producing only rhizomes and the second year developing the characteristic fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum molle is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
