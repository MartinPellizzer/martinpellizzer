                <h1>Acrostichum molle</h1>
<p>Acrostichum molle, commonly known as soft fern or silky fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are biennial, with the first year producing only rhizomes and the second year developing the characteristic fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum molle is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum molle has broad, feather-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the spring, featuring yellowish structures and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a dark, spherical drupe that contains one seed, which is dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum molle is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with ample rainfall and is often associated with wetland ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from Mexico down through much of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum molle was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies or in swampy regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is often used in landscaping for its attractive, feather-like fronds. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness.</p>
