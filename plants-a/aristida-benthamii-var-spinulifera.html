                    <h1>Aristida benthamii var. spinulifera</h1>
<p>Aristida benthamii var. spinulifera, commonly known as the spinylifera grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy habitats. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This grass is often found in native grasslands and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>
