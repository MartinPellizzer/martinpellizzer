<p>Axonopus, commonly known as carpet grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants typically form dense, low-growing mats or carpets, often found in moist, shaded environments. Axonopus species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>They are often used in landscaping for their ability to suppress weeds and form a lush, green ground cover.</p>
