                <h1>Acer × polymorphum var. minor</h1>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. minor, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant colors in autumn. It produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. minor has compound leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in panicle-like clusters, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. minor is a hybrid maple species that originates from the native range of Japan, specifically Honshu and Shikoku islands.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to cultivation in gardens and botanical collections, primarily in temperate regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially sunny environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters, where it benefits from cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and limited wild populations, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. minor is a compact, ornamental maple known for its vibrant fall color and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or by seed collected in the fall. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages branching. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with heathers or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. minor is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in the spring. The plant acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a network of interdependent species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different stages of the growing season.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. minor is a decorative plant primarily valued for its ornamental qualities, such as its attractive foliage and unique growth form.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping and garden design to enhance visual appeal in residential and public spaces. While not widely used in culinary applications, it may be occasionally incorporated into traditional herbal remedies for its potential medicinal properties. Its presence in natural environments contributes to ecological diversity and supports local wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it serves as a symbol of resilience and adaptability in certain regions where it is native.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. minor has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety is also frequently used in hybrid breeding programs to create new ornamental maple species with enhanced traits. Hybrids involving Acer × polymorphum var. minor often combine the hardiness of its parent species with improved aesthetic features. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to a range of climates and its ability to thrive in urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, it remains a valuable addition to the horticultural palette due to its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
