                <h1>Adenophora verticillata</h1>
<p>Adenophora verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora verticillata has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2–5 cm long and 0.5–1 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a light green to reddish color. Its flowers are clustered in whorls, each consisting of five white to pale blue petals with prominent yellow stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora verticillata is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist to mesic habitats such as woodlands, swamps, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in regions with temperate climates and is often associated with eastern deciduous forests. Its range extends from New England down through the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is also present in parts of Ontario and Quebec in Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora verticillata was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive blue flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been planted. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals, leading to its establishment in new areas. It has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its rapid growth and spread pose ecological concerns in non-native habitats.</p>
