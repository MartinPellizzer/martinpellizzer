<p>Asplenium parviusculum, commonly known as the small-leaf shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
