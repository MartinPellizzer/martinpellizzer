                    <h1>Aira praecox</h1>
<p>Aira praecox, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Aira praecox is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
