                    <h1>Asperula longiflora subvar. vestita</h1>
<p>Asperula longiflora subvar. vestita, commonly known as the white-flowered woodruff, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. The leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in a fine, silvery down that gives the plant its "vestita" designation, meaning "dressed" in Latin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
