<p>Adiantum caudatum, commonly known as the feather-tail maidenhair fern, is a delicate and graceful fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that resemble delicate feathers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-brown spore cases called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum caudatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for shaded garden settings.</p>
