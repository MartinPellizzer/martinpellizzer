The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its growth habit is typically compact, with a rosette form that helps it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Anacampseros rigidula is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
