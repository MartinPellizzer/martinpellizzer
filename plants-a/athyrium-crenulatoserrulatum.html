<p>Athyrium crenulatoserrulatum, commonly known as the notched and serrulate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with notches and serrations along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
