                <h1>Adenosma lanceolata</h1>
<p>Adenosma lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma lanceolata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a length ranging from 5 to 10 cm and a width of about 1 to 2 cm, typically displaying a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, light green bark, and grows upright with a somewhat woody texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out underground, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma lanceolata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with lowland forests and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. It prefers well-drained soils and is often seen in the understorey of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of New Guinea and the islands of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma lanceolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often invading native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to be accidental, likely through human activities such as shipping or gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants, it is considered a potential weed in certain parts of New Zealand.</p>
