                    <h1>Aquilegia pyrenaica f. confusa</h1>
<p>Aquilegia pyrenaica f. confusa, commonly known as the Pyrenean columbine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common columbine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers with intricate, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to the Pyrenees Mountains and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm and produces both showy flowers and smaller, less conspicuous ones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
