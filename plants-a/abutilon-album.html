<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon album has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a pale green to grayish-green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading or upright habit. The flowers are showy, with five petals and a prominent yellow or orange center, blooming in clusters from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon album is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Africa and Southeast Asia, where it is now found in various locations. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
