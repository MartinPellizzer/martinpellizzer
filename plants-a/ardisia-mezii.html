                    <h1>Ardisia mezii</h1>
<p>Ardisia mezii, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are a key feature for attracting birds. Ardisia mezii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit.</p>
