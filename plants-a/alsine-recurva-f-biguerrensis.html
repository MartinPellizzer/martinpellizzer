<p>Alsine recurva f. biguerrensis, commonly known as the Biguerren sand-plant, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal dunes of southern France.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in sandy, saline environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
