                    <h1>Antennaria dioica f. ramosa</h1>
<p>Antennaria dioica f. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a flowering plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in moist, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its more branched structure compared to the typical form of Antennaria dioica.</p>
