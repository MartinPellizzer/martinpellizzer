                <h1>Achillea odorata subsp. pectinata</h1>
<p>Achillea odorata subsp.</p>
<p>pectinata, commonly known as the fragrant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, narrow leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its finely pectinated (toothed) leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata subsp.</p>
<p>pectinata has compound, pinnately divided leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are arranged in flat-topped umbels, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata subsp.</p>
<p>pectinata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries such as France, Italy, and Spain. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it is sometimes cultivated.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands, often in well-drained soils. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, though it is not currently listed as endangered globally.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata subsp.</p>
<p>pectinata is a hardy perennial known for its aromatic foliage and delicate white flowers. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilize lightly in early spring and prune after flowering to encourage bushier growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme enhances its fragrance and deters pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata subsp.</p>
<p>pectinata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, due to its showy yellow flowers and robust growth.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to attract beneficial insects. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
