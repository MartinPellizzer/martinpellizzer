                    <h1>Alchemilla arvensis var. lucronensis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla arvensis var. lucronensis, commonly known as the golden alkanet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a distinctive, pale yellow to greenish-brown seed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its historical use in alchemical practices and its medicinal properties.</p>
