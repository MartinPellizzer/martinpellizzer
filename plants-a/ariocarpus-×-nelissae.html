                    <h1>Ariocarpus × nelissae</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus × nelissae, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a rare and unique hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ariocarpus fissuratus and Ariocarpus retusus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored, upper portion known as the pseudostem, which is actually a grafted part of a different species. The lower, root-like structure is typically a green, succulent base that provides the plant with essential nutrients. This plant is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and horticultural appeal, Ariocarpus × nelissae is highly sought after by plant enthusiasts and conservationists alike.</p>
