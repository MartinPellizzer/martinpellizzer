<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped thalloid structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on decaying wood or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are closely arranged and lack true stems, typical of the hepatic plant group.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
