                <h1>Acrocoelium congolanum</h1>
<p>Acrocoelium congolanum, commonly known as the Congo star moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort found in tropical rainforest regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped thalloid structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on decaying wood or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are closely arranged and lack true stems, typical of the hepatic plant group.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocoelium congolanum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically measuring 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocoelium congolanum is primarily native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions with moist, well-drained soils. It is often associated with humid lowland areas and can be found in forested or savanna-like habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the continent of Africa, where it thrives in warm and humid climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocoelium congolanum was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and abandoned lands. The plant is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, including trade and transportation of plants or soil.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
