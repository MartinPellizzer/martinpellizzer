<p>Amyris zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka.</p>

The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits containing hard seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native habitat.</p>
