<p>Acacia mellifera subsp.</p>
<p>detinens, commonly known as the honey acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments due to its drought tolerance and deep root system.</p>
