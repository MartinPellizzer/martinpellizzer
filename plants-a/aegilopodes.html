<p>Aegilopodes, commonly known as the slender grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows or along stream banks. Aegilopodes species are generally herbaceous, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and ecological role, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to prevent erosion.</p>
