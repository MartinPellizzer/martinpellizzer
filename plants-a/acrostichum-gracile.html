<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum gracile thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories or near water sources.</p>
