                    <h1>Acanthophyllum axillare</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum axillare, commonly known as the desert holly, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum axillare plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
