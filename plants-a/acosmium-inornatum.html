                <h1>Acosmium inornatum</h1>
<p>Acosmium inornatum, commonly known as the smooth acosmium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium inornatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface that contrasts with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark that is typically brown and fissured, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium inornatum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically occurring in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats, including swamp forests and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress swamps. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator plant for certain wetland types.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium inornatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in states like North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land development and transportation corridors.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
