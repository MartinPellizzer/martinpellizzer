                <h1>Acourtia gracilis</h1>
<p>Acourtia gracilis, commonly known as the slender acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers.</p>
<p>Acourtia gracilis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia gracilis has slender, erect stems that are typically green and slightly hairy, growing in a clump or spreading habit.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, linear, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a pointed tip. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia gracilis is primarily native to Mexico Central and the Mexico Gulf region.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in coastal and inland areas within these regions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shores and in drier habitats. Acourtia gracilis is often associated with coastal dunes and scrub environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia gracilis was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in coastal environments. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original introduction range due to its adaptability and reproductive success.</p>
