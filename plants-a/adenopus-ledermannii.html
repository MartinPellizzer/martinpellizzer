<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and are usually yellowish-green in color.</p>
<p>Adenopus ledermannii is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
