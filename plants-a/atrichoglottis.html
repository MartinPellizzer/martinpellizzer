<p>Atrichoglottis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy inflorescence. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Atrichoglottis is considered an endangered species.</p>
