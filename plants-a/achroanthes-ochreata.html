                <h1>Achroanthes ochreata</h1>
<p>Achroanthes ochreata, commonly known as the ochre bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achroanthes ochreata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a pale greenish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly rough to the touch, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes ochreata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This species thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland wetlands. It is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of the area.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a rare and endangered species, with limited distribution and specific habitat requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes ochreata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several states along the southeastern United States. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in invaded areas.</p>
<p>The distribution of Achroanthes ochreata is expanding, indicating its adaptability to new environments.</p>
