<p>Acer campestre subsp.</p>
<p>acuminatilobum, commonly known as the acorn maple, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically serrated and have a distinctive acorn-like shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its autumn foliage, which displays shades of yellow, orange, and red.</p>
