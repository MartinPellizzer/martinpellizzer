<p>Antrophyum winitii, commonly known as the Winitii cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often a deep green in color. Native to the Philippines, this cycad thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary history and role in understanding the development of cycads.</p>
