                <h1>Adiantum daddsii</h1>
<p>Adiantum daddsii, commonly known as the Dadds' maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adiantum daddsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum daddsii has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a feathery appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a delicate, translucent quality. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clumping manner. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, and it does not produce true flowers or seeds, instead relying on spore dispersal for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum daddsii is primarily native to the southern Appalachian Mountains of the United States, specifically in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. This fern is often found in areas with limestone bedrock, which contributes to the alkaline soil conditions it prefers. It is commonly associated with cove forests and other mesic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum daddsii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for temperate climates. This plant is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activity, including horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses worldwide.</p>
