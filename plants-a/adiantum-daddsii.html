<p>Adiantum daddsii, commonly known as the Dadds' maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adiantum daddsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
