<p>Aridaria nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. It has a taproot system that allows it to access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Aridaria nitida is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
