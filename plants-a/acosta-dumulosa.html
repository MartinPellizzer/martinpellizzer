                <h1>Acosta dumulosa</h1>
<p>Acosta dumulosa, commonly known as the woolly acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta dumulosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta dumulosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and coastal plains, where it thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high solar radiation and low precipitation. It is often seen growing in scrublands and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the natural vegetation of the region's dry climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta dumulosa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to stabilize sandy and rocky soils. Its introduction has been largely driven by ecological restoration efforts and landscaping in dry environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
