<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, blue-green foliage and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine, arctic, and temperate regions.</p>
<p>Agropyron pumilum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a forage plant.</p>
