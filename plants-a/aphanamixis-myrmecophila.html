The plant has a woody stem with aerial roots that help anchor it to trees in its native habitat. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests.</p>
