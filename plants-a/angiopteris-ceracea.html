                    <h1>Angiopteris ceracea</h1>
<p>Angiopteris ceracea, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often hairy fronds that give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to two meters, and they are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
