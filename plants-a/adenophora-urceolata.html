                <h1>Adenophora urceolata</h1>
<p>Adenophora urceolata, commonly known as the bell-shaped bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with toothed margins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to naturalize and form dense clumps over time.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora urceolata has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy, with a bluish-green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range from pale blue to violet, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora urceolata is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of these countries, though it is now considered rare and restricted to specific habitats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Adenophora urceolata is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora urceolata is a charming perennial known for its bell-shaped flowers and graceful growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer, then going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain its form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
