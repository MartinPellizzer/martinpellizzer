                <h1>Adenophora urceolata</h1>
<p>Adenophora urceolata, commonly known as the bellflower or bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adenophora urceolata is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits in native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora urceolata has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are bell-shaped, arranged in clusters, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late summer to early fall, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora urceolata is primarily native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, as well as in provinces like Ontario and Quebec. This plant typically grows in moist, open habitats like woodlands, meadows, and stream banks. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in areas with partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Adenophora urceolata is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its bell-shaped blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora urceolata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes where it can receive full sun to partial shade. This plant is often found in regions with cool summers and cold winters, such as the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human-assisted spread through gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has become a common sight in cultivated landscapes across its range.</p>
