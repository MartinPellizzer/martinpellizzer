                    <h1>Arenaria arctica</h1>
<p>Arenaria arctica, commonly known as arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils, with a shallow root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in freezing conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria arctica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic fauna.</p>
