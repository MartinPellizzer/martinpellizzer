                    <h1>Alsophila sodiroi var. obtusipinnula</h1>
<p>Alsophila sodiroi var. obtusipinnula, commonly known as the broad-pinnuled tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The fronds are typically broad and have a distinctly obtuse shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a prized specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
