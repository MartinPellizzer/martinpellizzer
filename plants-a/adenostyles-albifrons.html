                <h1>Adenostyles albifrons</h1>
<p>Adenostyles albifrons, commonly known as the white-fronded bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of linear, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Adenostyles albifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles albifrons has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles albifrons is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, including the chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with coastal bluffs and slopes. It is also present in parts of Oregon and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Adenostyles albifrons is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles albifrons was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common invader in disturbed environments. This plant is particularly aggressive in spreading through its rhizomes, which allows it to colonize new areas rapidly. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in regions outside its native range.</p>
