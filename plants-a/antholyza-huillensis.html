<p>Antholyza huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√©n's antholyza, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine areas. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Antholyza huillensis is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
