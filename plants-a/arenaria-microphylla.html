                    <h1>Arenaria microphylla</h1>
<p>Arenaria microphylla, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
