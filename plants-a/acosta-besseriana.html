                <h1>Acosta besseriana</h1>
<p>Acosta besseriana, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, pendulous flower clusters that resemble bells, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acosta besseriana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta besseriana has alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, greyish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta besseriana is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude environments, including cloud forests and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in temperate to cool climates with high humidity. It is often associated with areas of volcanic origin due to the nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta besseriana was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
