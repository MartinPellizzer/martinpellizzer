                <h1>Adelopetalum lingulatum</h1>
<p>Adelopetalum lingulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cariophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along its stems. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of five sepals that lack true petals, a feature common in the genus Adelopetalum.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum lingulatum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and display a pale yellow color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist environments for efficient nutrient absorption.</p>
