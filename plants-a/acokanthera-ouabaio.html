                <h1>Acokanthera ouabaio</h1>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to central Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic compounds, making it a significant species in traditional medicine and a source of poisons for hunting arrows.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in terminal panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio is primarily native to western and central Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, and Cameroon. This plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and secondary forests. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the dense, humid habitats of the African continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio was mainly introduced to the Americas as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique characteristics.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in regions such as Florida and parts of the Caribbean, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant is toxic and has raised concerns regarding its potential impact on local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to discussions about its role in invasive plant management.</p>
<p>However, it remains primarily a cultivated species rather than a widespread invasive one.</p>
