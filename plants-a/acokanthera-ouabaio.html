                <h1>Acokanthera ouabaio</h1>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to central and western Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, with smooth, greyish bark and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, black seeds.</p>
<p>It is notable for its toxic properties, as its leaves and bark contain cardiac glycosides, which have been historically used in poison-tipped arrows by indigenous peoples.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio is a rare and toxic plant native to central and western Africa, specifically found in countries such as Gabon, Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within its native range due to habitat loss and human activities. It thrives in humid tropical rainforests, often growing in the understorey of dense vegetation. The plant is typically found at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acokanthera ouabaio is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio is a striking, toxic plant native to tropical Africa, known for its ornamental beauty and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and promote new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in the surrounding ecosystem. Its deep roots help in erosion control by stabilizing the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of the region.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio is a plant native to West Africa, known for its toxic properties and diverse applications.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat ailments such as cancer, malaria, and skin infections due to its bioactive compounds. Its latex has industrial applications, including the production of rubber and adhesives, contributing to local economies. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some communities, representing both danger and healing.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, its use requires careful handling and is primarily limited to traditional practices under expert supervision.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acokanthera ouabaio has several varieties and cultivars that are of interest in horticulture, though specific cultivars are not widely documented in common horticultural literature.</p>
<p>Some hybrids have been developed to enhance its ornamental value or adaptability to different climates. While it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes, it holds significance in traditional medicine and as a source of toxic compounds. Its horticultural importance lies mainly in its role as a botanical curiosity and potential for research into plant toxicity.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and toxicity, it is not a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>
