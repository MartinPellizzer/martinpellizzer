                    <h1>Alisma verticillatum</h1>
<p>Alisma verticillatum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a whorl at the base, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its aquatic habitat allows it to thrive in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Alisma verticillatum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
