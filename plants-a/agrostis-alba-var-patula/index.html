                            <h1>Agrostis Alba Var. Patula</h1>
<p>Common bluegrass, scientifically known as Agrostis alba var. patula, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing turf. Its adaptability makes it a common sight in both natural and cultivated landscapes. Despite its widespread presence, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
