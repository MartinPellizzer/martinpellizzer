<p>It features slender, ascending stems with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, often with a hairy texture, and the foliage is generally covered in fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The simple form of this plant, as indicated by the 'f.</p>
