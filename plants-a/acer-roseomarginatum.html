                <h1>Acer roseomarginatum</h1>
<p>Acer roseomarginatum, commonly known as the rose-marginated maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring leaves with a pale pink to reddish margin that stands out against the green center. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer roseomarginatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a vibrant green color on the upper surface with a pale pink or red margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellow-green petals and a red calyx, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the lightweight structure of the samara.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer roseomarginatum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, typically found in mountain forests. This species grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer roseomarginatum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer roseomarginatum is a striking maple species known for its vibrant red leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering a more reliable and faster method. The plant grows best in temperate climates, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and encourage air circulation are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or lavender beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer roseomarginatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of plant and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer roseomarginatum is a decorative maple species known for its ornamental value in landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have limited use in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and paper industries due to its wood quality.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer roseomarginatum has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Aconitifolium' and 'Flame Aurora,' which showcase striking red and yellow foliage.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in gardens for their vibrant autumn color. Hybrids of Acer roseomarginatum have been developed to enhance traits such as disease resistance and growth habit, making them more adaptable to different climates. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add seasonal interest and its role in landscape design.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer roseomarginatum and its varieties contribute significantly to the diversity of ornamental trees in horticulture.</p>
