                    <h1>Aconitum rigidum</h1>
<p>Aconitum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a distinctive hooded shape typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided and covered in a fine downy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>
