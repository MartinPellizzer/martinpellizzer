                <h1>Aconitum rigidum</h1>
<p>Aconitum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a distinctive hooded shape typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided and covered in a fine downy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum rigidum has leaves that are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically green with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, consisting of five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, fleshy, and used for storage and propagation.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rigidum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. This species is commonly found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges, where the climate is cold and the vegetation is sparse. It is adapted to harsh conditions and is typically found in open meadows or on slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rigidum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions. The plant is commonly found in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and along streambanks. It spreads primarily through its persistent seeds and can form dense stands in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens, contributing to its spread.</p>
