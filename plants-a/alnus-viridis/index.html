                            <h1>Alnus Viridis</h1>
<p>Alnus viridis, commonly known as the green alder, is a versatile deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish catkins that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and along forest edges. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession. Alnus viridis plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and improving soil fertility in degraded landscapes.</p>
