<p>Acacia spirocarpa var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered wattle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow globular flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, and it produces small, flat, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that enable it to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
