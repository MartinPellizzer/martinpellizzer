                            <h1>Allium Chamaemoly Var. Littoralis</h1>
<p>Littoral garlic, scientifically known as Allium chamaemoly var. littoralis, is a rare and resilient plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, white or pale purple flowers and its ability to withstand salt spray and harsh winds. This variety of garlic is often found in sandy soils along shorelines, where it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Despite its hardy nature, it remains a delicate species with limited distribution. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for ecological study and conservation efforts.</p>
