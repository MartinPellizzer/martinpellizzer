<p>Alisma gramineum subsp.</p>
<p>wahlenbergii, commonly known as Wahlenberg's water plantain, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small white flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in aquatic environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly pointed, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to northern regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates.</p>
