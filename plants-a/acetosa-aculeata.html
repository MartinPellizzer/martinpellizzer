                <h1>Acetosa aculeata</h1>
<p>Acetosa aculeata, commonly known as the prickly sorrel, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, triangular leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acetosa aculeata is noted for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosa aculeata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in terminal racemes, blooming in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosa aculeata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, particularly in areas with similar climatic conditions to its native habitat. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acetosa aculeata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosa aculeata is a hardy, spiny plant commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds sown in early spring and rhizomes divided in early spring or fall. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in about two to three years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Regular fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with marigolds or garlic to deter pests.</p>
