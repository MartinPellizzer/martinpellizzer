<p>Agrostis ravennae, commonly known as Raven's grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, compact clumps with slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more prominent in the summer months.</p>
<p>Agrostis ravennae is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils.</p>
