                    <h1>Achyrophorus tenuifolius var. neaeanus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus tenuifolius var. neaeanus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple stems arising from a central base, and its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.</p>
