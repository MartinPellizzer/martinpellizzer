                <h1>Adicea peploides</h1>
<p>Adicea peploides, commonly known as the woolly adicea, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Adicea peploides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea peploides has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea peploides is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and inland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is commonly found in dunes, salt marshes, and other saline or semi-arid environments. It is well adapted to withstand drought and salt exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea peploides was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine environments along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water conditions and is often found in intertidal zones. This plant has been noted for its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in marshes and tidal flats where it can form dense stands.</p>
