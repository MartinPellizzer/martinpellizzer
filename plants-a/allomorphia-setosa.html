<p>Allomorphia setosa, commonly known as the hairy allomorph, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name "setosa," meaning "bristly" in Latin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
