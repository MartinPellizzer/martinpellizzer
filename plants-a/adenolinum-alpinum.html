                <h1>Adenolinum alpinum</h1>
<p>Adenolinum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine adenolinum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adenolinum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum alpinum has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and slightly woody, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes more cracked with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum alpinum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in mountainous areas with limited vegetation. It is also occasionally reported in the Caucasus region, though its presence there is less common.</p>
<p>Adenolinum alpinum is a rare and specialized species, typically growing in isolated habitats across these high-altitude zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum alpinum was mainly introduced to regions with high altitudes and cool climates, typically found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to grow optimally. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and resilience to harsh weather conditions. It has been introduced to several parts of Europe and North America as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
