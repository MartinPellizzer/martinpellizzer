The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid environment. Its blooming cycle occurs once every three years, making it a subject of fascination for botanists.</p>
<p>The dual-sex nature of its flowers has led to ongoing research into its genetic and ecological significance.</p>
