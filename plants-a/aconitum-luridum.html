                <h1>Aconitum luridum</h1>
<p>Aconitum luridum, commonly known as the yellow aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum luridum has leaves that are typically large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a bluish-green color and a fibrous texture, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, capable of storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum luridum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including countries such as Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils and open meadows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species is commonly associated with limestone and calcareous substrates, which provide the specific conditions it requires for growth. It is a perennial herbaceous plant known for its striking purple to reddish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum luridum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous or high-altitude environments. The plant is known for its striking purple or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It has been introduced to various regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
