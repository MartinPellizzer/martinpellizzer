<p>Amygdalus communis f. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-lobed peach.</p>
<p>This botanical variant is a naturally occurring form of the peach tree, characterized by its distinct leaf morphology. The leaves are narrow and have sharply pointed lobes, setting it apart from the typical peach variety. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>While it shares the fruiting capabilities of the common peach, its ornamental value is often emphasized in horticultural settings.</p>
