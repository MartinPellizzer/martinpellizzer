<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
