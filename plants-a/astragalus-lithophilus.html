                    <h1>Astragalus lithophilus</h1>
<p>Astragalus lithophilus, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Astragalus lithophilus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
