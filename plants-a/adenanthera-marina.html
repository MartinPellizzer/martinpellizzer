                <h1>Adenanthera marina</h1>
<p>Adenanthera marina, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, showcasing its adaptability to coastal conditions. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often covered in a whitish, powdery coating.</p>
<p>Adenanthera marina is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera marina has alternate, narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically green and slightly pubescent, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera marina is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along the coastal regions of the Malay Peninsula. This plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. It is often seen in mangrove and tidal swamp areas.</p>
<p>Adenanthera marina plays an important ecological role in these coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera marina was mainly introduced to coastal areas for erosion control and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along shorelines in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has become naturalized in several countries, including Australia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread beyond its original introduction sites.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
