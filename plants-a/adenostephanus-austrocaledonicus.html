                <h1>Adenostephanus austrocaledonicus</h1>
<p>Adenostephanus austrocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the region. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus austrocaledonicus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus austrocaledonicus is primarily native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests and mountainous regions of this French overseas territory. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with shaded understory environments. It is endemic to New Caledonia, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the archipelago's unique ecological zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus austrocaledonicus was mainly introduced to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant belonging to the legume family. The introduction likely occurred through human activity, possibly as an ornamental or for other practical purposes. It has since become naturalized in certain areas of the region.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains a subject of ongoing study.</p>
