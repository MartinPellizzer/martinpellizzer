                        <h1>Acacia benthamii var. angustior</h1>
<p>Acacia benthamii var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear phyllodes that are typically 5â€“10 cm long and have a distinctive yellow to golden color. The plant produces small, globular yellow flower heads during the warmer months, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in arid regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia benthamii var. angustior is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in the Pilbara and Geraldton areas, where it thrives in sandy soils. It is typically associated with coastal and inland dunes, as well as rocky outcrops. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and can survive with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern and western parts of the state.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia benthamii var. angustior was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate climate, typically found in regions with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and rocky slopes. This variety is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil. Its introduction has been primarily for ecological restoration and erosion control.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
