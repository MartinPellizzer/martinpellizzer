                <h1>Actinostephanus enpingensis</h1>
<p>Actinostephanus enpingensis, commonly known as the Guangdong star-flowered plant, is a rare flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostephanus enpingensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a white color and a simple structure, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostephanus enpingensis is primarily native to China, specifically the Guangdong province.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the Enping area. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The species is typically found in forested areas and rocky hillsides.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostephanus enpingensis was mainly introduced to regions with high humidity and warm climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams or ponds. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf structure and vibrant foliage. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ecological concern in some regions.</p>
