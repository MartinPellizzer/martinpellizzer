                        <h1>Abutilon minarum</h1>
<p>Abutilon minarum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a velvety texture, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon minarum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abutilon minarum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a wide range of morphological diversity, including ferns and flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and citrus.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and includes families like Malvaceae and Theaceae. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with hairy stems and showy flowers, such as cotton and hibiscus. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "Chinese lanterns" due to their distinctive seed pods.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon minarum, a specific type of Abutilon known for its unique characteristics and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon minarum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with forested areas and disturbed habitats within this region. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid conditions typical of the area.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic location in Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon minarum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success as an introduced species.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread are ongoing in areas where it has established itself as a weed.</p>
