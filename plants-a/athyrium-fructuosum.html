                    <h1>Athyrium fructuosum</h1>
<p>Athyrium fructuosum, commonly known as the fruiting lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long, with a graceful, arching appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Athyrium fructuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
