<p>Anisomeris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer.
