                <h1>Acer monspessulanum subf. obtentum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>obtentum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and autumn coloration, which can range from yellow to orange.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>obtentum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, a winged nut, which is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>obtentum is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the maple tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Spain and parts of Portugal. While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in the southern regions of these countries.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in open woodlands and scrublands, often growing in sunny, dry environments. This subspecies is typically found at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>obtentum is a slow-growing, compact maple known for its distinctive red foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer, which root readily under humid conditions. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and early summer, followed by a period of rest in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like sedum or heather can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>obtentum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and birds. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports soil stability and improves overall habitat quality for diverse ecological communities.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>obtentum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities. While it does not have significant medicinal applications, its wood is sometimes used in small-scale woodworking due to its fine grain and durability.</p>
<p>The plant holds cultural significance in certain regions where it is used as a symbol of resilience and adaptability. It also contributes to local biodiversity and ecosystem stability, supporting various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological restoration projects highlights its importance in maintaining natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>obtentum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value. Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Red Baron', known for their striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>Hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, have been developed to enhance color and growth habits. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in gardens and landscapes for their vibrant fall colors.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to add seasonal interest and diversity to ornamental plant collections.</p>
