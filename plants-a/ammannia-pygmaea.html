                    <h1>Ammannia pygmaea</h1>
<p>Ammannia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf ammannia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>Ammannia pygmaea is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and marshes.</p>
