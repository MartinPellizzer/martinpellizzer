                <h1>Achnatherum caudatum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum caudatum, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum caudatum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, parallel-veined, and typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense tufts or clumps. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of small, pale green to brown florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, forming a dense network near the soil surface, which helps stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum caudatum is primarily native to the northern and central regions of North America, including parts of Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, prairies, and open areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with dry to moist meadows. It is particularly prevalent in the Great Plains and western states.</p>
<p>Achnatherum caudatum plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum caudatum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. This plant has become established in several states, including California, Nevada, and Oregon. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as land development and transportation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native plant communities.</p>
