<p>Arachniodes wulingshanensis, commonly known as the Wuling Mountain arachniodes, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires protection.</p>
