<p>Alatiglossum psyche, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant blooms that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has thin, leathery leaves and requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
