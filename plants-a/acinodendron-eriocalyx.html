                <h1>Acinodendron eriocalyx</h1>
<p>Acinodendron eriocalyx, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its soft, silky hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white in color.</p>
<p>Acinodendron eriocalyx is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to thrive in poor soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eriocalyx has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eriocalyx is primarily native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly found in primary and secondary tropical rainforests. This plant is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas due to its adaptability to varying light conditions. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and possibly on some nearby islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of moist, well-drained soils in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eriocalyx was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since been cultivated in various parts of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown potential to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. The plant is now classified as a potential environmental weed in some regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains limited but is monitored due to its invasive potential.</p>
