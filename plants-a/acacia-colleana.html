                        <h1>Acacia colleana</h1>
<p>Acacia colleana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Acacia colleana is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia colleana is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, savannah-like habitats and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in regions with a semi-arid to arid climate. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia colleana was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. Its introduction has helped restore degraded lands in several regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
