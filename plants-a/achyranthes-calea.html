                <h1>Achyranthes calea</h1>
<p>Achyranthes calea, commonly known as the Indian knotgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or red in color, which develop into hard, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achyranthes calea is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes calea has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 3–6 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy lower surface.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody as the plant matures. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters, blooming from July to September, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes calea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas within forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it a common species in lowland and mountainous regions. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes calea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been cultivated. The plant has adapted well to various environmental conditions, allowing it to spread beyond its original range. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several areas outside its native distribution.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is present.</p>
