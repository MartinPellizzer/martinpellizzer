                    <h1>Andrachne attenuata var. microcalyx</h1>
<p>Andrachne attenuata var. microcalyx, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences called cymes. Its leaves are linear, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
