                    <h1>Araucaria mackeeii</h1>
<p>Araucaria mackeeii, commonly known as the Mackee's araucaria, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the high-altitude regions of central Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar trunk and dense, feather-like foliage that forms a broad, rounded crown. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange-red aril, which is an adaptation for animal dispersal. Its slow growth rate and limited geographic range make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, Araucaria mackeeii is considered a living fossil and a key species in the study of conifer evolution.</p>
