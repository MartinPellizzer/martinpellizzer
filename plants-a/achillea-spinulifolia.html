                <h1>Achillea spinulifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea spinulifolia, commonly known as the spiked yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its spiky, bract-like structures that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its aromatic compounds and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulifolia has compound, serrated leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough texture and alternate arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, composite umbels with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulifolia is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the central and eastern regions of the country. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in open areas. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of Turkey.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to the Anatolian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulifolia was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and Australia. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it effective for preventing soil erosion and reducing dust.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
