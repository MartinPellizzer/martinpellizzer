                <h1>Achillea spinulifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea spinulifolia, commonly known as the spiny yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, fern-like foliage and produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its finely divided leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Achillea spinulifolia is also noted for its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulifolia has leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is typically upright. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of California in the United States. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is currently listed as a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulifolia is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a typical growth cycle, blooming in early summer and producing seeds by late summer, though it may go dormant in colder regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and vigor. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or marigolds can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
