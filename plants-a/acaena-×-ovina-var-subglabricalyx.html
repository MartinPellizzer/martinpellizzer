                        <h1>Acaena × ovina var. subglabricalyx</h1>
<p>Acaena × ovina var. subglabricalyx, commonly known as the coastal acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiny stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains small, hard seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena × ovina var. subglabricalyx is primarily native to the temperate regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>This variety is commonly found in dry to semi-arid environments, including grasslands and shrublands. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high sunlight exposure. The plant is often associated with coastal and inland valleys, where it forms part of the local vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological niches that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena × ovina var. subglabricalyx was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. This variety is a hybrid between Acaena ovina and Acaena subglabricalyx. It has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in the northern regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk.</p>
