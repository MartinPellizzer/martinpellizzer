<p>Acacia guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellowish-green to golden yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Acacia guadalupensis is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in providing habitat and forage for local wildlife in its native range.</p>
