                        <h1>Acacia signata</h1>
<p>Acacia signata, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Acacia signata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia signata belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a wide range of morphological diversity, including ferns and some modern plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with complex flower structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with five petals and are often legumes. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive acacia-like leaves and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia signata, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, known for its unique characteristics and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia signata is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils and coastal environments. This species thrives in Mediterranean climates characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands, growing as a shrub or small tree.</p>
<p>Acacia signata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia signata was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats, including roadsides and disturbed areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils have contributed to its establishment in new regions. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
