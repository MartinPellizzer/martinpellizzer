<p>Aechmea pabstii, commonly known as the Pabst's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Aechmea pabstii is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea pabstii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a textured surface that helps retain water.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upward from the base of the plant. Its flowers are borne in a terminal inflorescence, consisting of bright red bracts that enclose small, tubular flowers, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind after the capsule opens.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in the soil, with some rhizomes that help in nutrient absorption.</p>
