                <h1>Abutilon affine</h1>
<p>Abutilon affine, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous seeds. Abutilon affine thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon affine has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are pendulous, with five lobed petals, typically yellow or orange in color, and they bloom in summer, being pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon affine is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico, and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across the United States, including Texas, California, and the southwestern states, as well as in some areas of Mexico. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or along dry streambeds. It typically occurs at low to moderate elevations, ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Abutilon affine is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though it is sensitive to habitat disruption and overgrazing.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon affine is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub known for its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. During its growth cycle, it thrives in warm climates and produces flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to avoid root rot. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
