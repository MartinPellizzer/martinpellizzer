                <h1>Acer macrophyllum f. imbricatum</h1>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. imbricatum, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a variant of the bigleaf maple characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are large, typically reaching up to 12 inches in diameter, and are often deeply lobed with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. imbricatum has large, broad leaves that are heart-shaped (broad ovate) with a wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 15 cm in length, typically displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind after maturation in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. imbricatum is a variant of the bigleaf maple, native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in parts of Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations in moist, temperate forests. It thrives in environments with high humidity, partial shade, and well-drained soil, typically growing at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as endangered in some regions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. imbricatum is a striking evergreen shrub known for its large, leathery leaves and vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or hardwood cuttings in late fall, which root easily under humid conditions. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in cooler climates and reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. imbricatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse array of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. imbricatum is a variant of the bigleaf maple known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal remedies for their mild astringent properties. In industrial contexts, the wood of this plant is valued for its fine texture and is sometimes used in cabinetry and furniture making. Culturally, it holds significance in native communities, where it is often used in ceremonial practices and as a symbol of resilience and connection to the land.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a vital role in both environmental and cultural contexts within its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. imbricatum has several popular cultivars, including 'Emerald Queen' and 'Crimson Queen', which are prized for their striking foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer x carpinifolium, which combine the ornamental features of multiple parent plants. These varieties are highly valued in horticulture for their vibrant autumn colors and adaptability to various garden conditions. Their aesthetic appeal makes them popular choices for landscaping and ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Overall, they contribute significantly to the diversity and beauty of cultivated maple collections.</p>
