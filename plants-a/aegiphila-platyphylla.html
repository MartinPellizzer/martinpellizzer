                <h1>Aegiphila platyphylla</h1>
<p>Aegiphila platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Aegiphila platyphylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila platyphylla has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting insect pollinators. The fruit is a dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
