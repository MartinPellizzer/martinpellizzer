                <h1>Acer lobelii var. platanoides</h1>
<p>Acer lobelii var. platanoides, commonly known as the plains maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central and western United States.</p>
<p>It features palmately lobed leaves that are typically green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii var. platanoides has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, with a broad, maple-like shape, medium size, and a vibrant green color that turns red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, growing in a single trunk with a spreading crown. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii var. platanoides is a variant of the maple tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in parts of Tennessee and North Carolina.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily found in specific regions of the Appalachian Mountains. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded forest environments. It typically grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as endangered in some states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii var. platanoides is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall color and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species grows slowly, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to aphids or leaf spot in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii var. platanoides is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of insect life. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an effective stabilizer in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by contributing organic matter as it decomposes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii var. platanoides is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary or medicinal use due to its small size and specific habitat.</p>
<p>However, it plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for local wildlife. In terms of industrial applications, it is not widely used for commercial purposes, though its wood may have minor local use in small-scale crafts. Culturally, it is often valued for its ornamental appeal and can be used in landscaping to enhance the aesthetic of natural areas.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the unique biodiversity of its native regions, contributing to conservation efforts and environmental awareness.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii var. platanoides has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. Hybrids involving this variety often exhibit improved hardiness and unique leaf patterns. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add seasonal interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic value, it is a sought-after species among landscape designers and garden enthusiasts.</p>
