<p>Adenoderris, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to various regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Adenoderris species are characterized by their striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, feather-like leaflets, and the plants can grow as shrubs or small trees.</p>
<p>They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil enrichment through nitrogen fixation.</p>
