                <h1>Acer mandshuricum subsp. kansuense</h1>
<p>Acer mandshuricum subsp.</p>
<p>kansuense, commonly known as the Kansu maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer mandshuricum subsp.</p>
<p>kansuense has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red or yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth habit.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer mandshuricum subsp.</p>
<p>kansuense is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, specifically found in China, Korea, and Russia. Its current distribution includes regions in northeastern China, particularly in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate environments, often growing in mixed forests and along riverbanks. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is of concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer mandshuricum subsp.</p>
<p>kansuense is a cold-hardy deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants like ferns and heathers in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer mandshuricum subsp.</p>
<p>kansuense is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity and pollination networks.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion species, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by shedding leaves that enrich the forest floor with organic matter.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer mandshuricum subsp.</p>
<p>kansuense is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species for syrup production.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is valued as a symbol of resilience and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer mandshuricum subsp.</p>
<p>kansuense has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that contribute to its horticultural appeal. Popular cultivars include 'Korshinskyi' and 'Crimson King,' known for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as *Acer ginnala* and *Acer truncatum*, to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more striking foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic value and adaptability, this species holds significant horticultural importance in landscaping and garden design.</p>
