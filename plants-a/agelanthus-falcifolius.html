                    <h1>Agelanthus falcifolius</h1>
<p>Agelanthus falcifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desert shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a source of fuelwood in some regions.</p>
