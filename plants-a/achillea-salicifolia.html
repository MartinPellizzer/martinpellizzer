<p>It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a silvery-gray underside, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achillea salicifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental qualities and is often used in dry, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea salicifolia has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically 5–10 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branched, and has a smooth, slightly hairy texture, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea salicifolia is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North Africa and has been introduced to some areas of the United States, primarily in California. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along stream banks. It typically grows at elevations between 600 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea salicifolia is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and vibrant yellow flowers, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
