                        <h1>Aberemoa bracteosa</h1>
<p>Aberemoa bracteosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist lowland areas.</p>
<p>Aberemoa bracteosa is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as hibiscus and cotton.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberemoa bracteosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to regions with stable, tropical climates and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberemoa bracteosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. The plant thrives in coastal and urban environments, often escaping cultivation and spreading into native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions have contributed to its establishment in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered a major invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
