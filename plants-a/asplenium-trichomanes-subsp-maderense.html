<p>Asplenium trichomanes subsp.</p>
<p>maderense, commonly known as the Maderan shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with lanceolate, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as limestone-rich soils in forest understories. Its fronds are usually unifacial, meaning they have a single surface with no distinct upper or lower side.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
