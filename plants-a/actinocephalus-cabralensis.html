                <h1>Actinocephalus cabralensis</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus cabralensis, commonly known as the Cape fynbos.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to South Africa, particularly found in the fynbos biome. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus cabralensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often twining around supports. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a tubular corolla, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus cabralensis is primarily native to the island of São Tomé and Príncipe in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the humid lowland rainforests of the island. It thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich organic soil. Its distribution is limited to this specific region, making it a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus cabralensis was mainly introduced to areas with suitable moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. The plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its introduction has been noted in several countries where it has established itself as a naturalized species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in many regions where it was not originally native.</p>
