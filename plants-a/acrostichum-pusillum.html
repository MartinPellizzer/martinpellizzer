                <h1>Acrostichum pusillum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf hawksbeard, is a small, perennial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lace-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called soruses, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pusillum has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a dense, feather-like pattern, typically less than 5 cm in length and a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows upright and branching. It produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pusillum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and wetlands where it thrives in brackish or saline conditions. This plant is often associated with estuaries and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pusillum is also occasionally found in parts of the Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pusillum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Florida and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in brackish water environments and mangrove swamps. This plant is often associated with disturbed coastal habitats and can thrive in areas with high salinity. It plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic species.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
