                    <h1>Atriplex brandegeei</h1>
<p>Atriplex brandegeei, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its survival in harsh conditions.</p>
