                <h1>Aegilops fonsii</h1>
<p>Aegilops fonsii, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the tribe Aveneae within the grass family Poaceae. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which is characteristic of the tribe.</p>
<p>Aegilops fonsii is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in genetic research and breeding programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops fonsii has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and it grows in a spreading pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
