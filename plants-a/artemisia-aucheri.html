                    <h1>Artemisia aucheri</h1>
<p>Artemisia aucheri, commonly known as Armenian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray, aromatic leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to its high concentration of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and digestive benefits.</p>
