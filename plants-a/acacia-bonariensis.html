                    <h1>Acacia bonariensis</h1>
<p>Acacia bonariensis, commonly known as the Chilean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia bonariensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage.</p>
