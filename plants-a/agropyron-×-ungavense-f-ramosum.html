                    <h1>Agropyron × ungavense f. ramosum</h1>
<p>Agropyron × ungavense f. ramosum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a polyploid grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit, which allows it to form dense, mat-like colonies. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with the lower florets being sterile, a feature common in many wheatgrass species. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant.</p>
