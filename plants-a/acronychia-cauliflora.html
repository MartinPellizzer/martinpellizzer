                <h1>Acronychia cauliflora</h1>
<p>Acronychia cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly from the trunk or branches. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Acronychia cauliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia cauliflora has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a tree-like growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a globose, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animal ingestion and droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia cauliflora is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wetter regions of the Cape York Peninsula and the adjacent areas of the Torres Strait. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments along the forest floor. It is typically associated with coastal and lowland rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia cauliflora was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
