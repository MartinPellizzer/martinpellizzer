<p>Astragalus gilvus, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
