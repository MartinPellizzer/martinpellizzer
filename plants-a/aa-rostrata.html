                <h1>Aa rostrata</h1>
<p>Aa rostrata, commonly known as the Hawaiian red hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red flowers and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in coastal and dry forest habitats. Aa rostrata produces showy, single flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the ecological balance of Hawaii's unique ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aa rostrata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Its stem is upright, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aa rostrata is a rare plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically found on the island of Maui.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few locations within the HaleakalƒÅ National Park. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing in rocky soil and on lava flows. Aa rostrata is found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aa rostrata is a unique and resilient plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Aa rostrata is relatively slow, with flowering typically occurring after several years of growth.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or rosemary can help repel pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aa rostrata is a native Hawaiian plant that provides food and shelter for various native wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and moths, which are essential for its reproduction. The plant acts as a companion plant in native ecosystems, supporting the growth of other endemic species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Aa rostrata contributes to maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to local fauna.</p>
