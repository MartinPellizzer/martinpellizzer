                    <h1>Angolaea fluitans</h1>
<p>Angolaea fluitans, commonly known as the floating angel's tears, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the water's surface. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
