<p>Aneilema umbrosum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and clusters of showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>Aneilema umbrosum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
