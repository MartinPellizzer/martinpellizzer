                <h1>Acer hyrcanum subsp. tauricola</h1>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a samara with a narrow wing.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>tauricola has palmately compound leaves that are usually 5-7 lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stems. The stems are slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and exhibit a straight growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>tauricola is a rare tree species native to the southern regions of the Caucasus, specifically in parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous areas of these regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in dry, rocky soils along riverbanks and in forest edges. This subspecies is found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>tauricola is a hardy tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and adaptability to various conditions. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle of this species includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and powdery mildew, making companion planting with aromatic herbs like rosemary or thyme beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>tauricola is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination network.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed vegetation, enhancing biodiversity and stabilizing the ecosystem. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind soil and prevent degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports the overall health of the ecosystem by offering ecological benefits such as habitat creation and nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>tauricola is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in local ecosystems for its role in supporting biodiversity. It has been used in traditional medicine in some regions for its potential anti-inflammatory and healing properties.</p>
<p>The tree's wood, though not widely used industrially, contributes to local economies through small-scale timber and craft industries. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain areas, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and cultural than industrial, highlighting its importance in preserving regional flora and heritage.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>tauricola has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color. It also has hybrids with other maple species, such as *Acer x freemanii*, which are valued for their adaptability and ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in landscaping due to their attractive foliage and resilience to urban conditions. Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to thrive in a variety of climates and soils, making them popular choices for gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Overall, they contribute significantly to the diversity of ornamental trees in horticulture.</p>
