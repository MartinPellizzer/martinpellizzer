                    <h1>Anthyllis vulneraria f. praepropera</h1>
<p>Anthyllis vulneraria f. praepropera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladder campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is typically found in dry, calcareous soils across Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
