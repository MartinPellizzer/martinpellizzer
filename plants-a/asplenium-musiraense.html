                    <h1>Asplenium musiraense</h1>
<p>Asplenium musiraense, commonly known as the Musira spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that form dense, compact rosettes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asplenium musiraense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
