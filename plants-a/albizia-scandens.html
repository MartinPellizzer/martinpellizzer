<p>Albizia scandens, commonly known as the weeping albizia, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>

Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Albizia scandens is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
