                        <h1>Acacia calamifolia var. wilhelmiana</h1>
<p>Acacia calamifolia var. wilhelmiana, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost silky appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves have been used traditionally in some indigenous communities for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia calamifolia var. wilhelmiana is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>This variant is found in the dry and semi-arid regions of the island, particularly in the south and southwest. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with limited rainfall. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local flora and is a characteristic species of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia calamifolia var. wilhelmiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The introduction occurred in the late 19th century by European settlers. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
