<p>Alsine funkii, commonly known as the Funk's sandgrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has thin, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed or desert landscapes.</p>
