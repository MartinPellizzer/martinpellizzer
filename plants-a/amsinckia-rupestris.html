<p>Amsinckia rupestris, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry, sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Amsinckia rupestris is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and rocky areas.</p>
