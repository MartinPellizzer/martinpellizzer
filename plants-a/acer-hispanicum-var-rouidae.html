                <h1>Acer hispanicum var. rouidae</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. rouidae, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a variant of the European maple native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. rouidae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and a reddish sepals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. rouidae is a rare and endemic maple variety native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in parts of southern Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra de Grazalema and Sierra de Almargene mountain ranges. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within evergreenæ Ž forests and shrublands. It typically grows at altitudes between 700 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is considered critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. rouidae is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The plant follows a typical deciduous growth cycle, shedding its leaves in autumn and regrowing them in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials or shrubs can enhance its growth in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. rouidae is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. This plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a variety of insect and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. rouidae is a lesser-known species of maple native to the Iberian Peninsula, primarily found in rocky and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor uses in local traditional recipes. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though its use remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability in its native habitat, supporting local wildlife and soil health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in regional flora studies and serves as an indicator species for conservation efforts in Mediterranean ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. rouidae has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Crimson Sentinel' and 'Autumn Flame' being among the most popular for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids of this variety are rare, some horticulturists have attempted to cross it with other maple species to enhance ornamental traits. Its unique foliage and adaptability to specific climates make it a valuable addition to specialized gardens and botanical collections. Due to its rarity and limited cultivation, it holds significant horticultural importance for plant enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation remains challenging, requiring careful attention to soil and climate conditions.</p>
