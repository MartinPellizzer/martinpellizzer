                <h1>Achillea grandifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea grandifolia, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring a creeping rhizome and basal leaves that are fern-like in appearance. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers from late spring to early summer. Its foliage is aromatic and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Achillea grandifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a silver-gray underside and a green upper surface, arranged in a rosette pattern, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody with a grayish-brown bark, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States, where it is cultivated in gardens. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its limited native range and potential for invasiveness in non-native areas have led to some conservation concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, with cuttings also being a viable method for faster growth. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, flowering in its second year before going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning spent flower heads encourages rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia is a valuable plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Achillea grandifolia also offers ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a wide range of wildlife.</p>
