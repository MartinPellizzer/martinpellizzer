                <h1>Achillea grandifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea grandifolia, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves and its clusters of small, pale yellow to white ray flowers. The plant produces numerous slender, branching stems that rise from the base, bearing the flower heads at the tips. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, arranged in a rosette pattern and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its flowers are compound umbels of white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in rocky, arid, or semi-arid environments, often growing in open slopes and grasslands. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat degradation, Achillea grandifolia is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia is a hardy perennial known for its showy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, often used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring good germination rates. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, thriving in its first year with a second-year bloom before going dormant.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring supports growth, while regular pruning after flowering encourages bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
