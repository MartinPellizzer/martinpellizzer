<p>Acantholimon leucacanthum, commonly known as the white-capped sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Acantholimon leucacanthum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
