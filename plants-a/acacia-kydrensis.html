<p>Acacia kydrensis, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia kydrensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and for its hard, durable wood.</p>
