                <h1>Aconitum refractum</h1>
<p>Aconitum refractum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant produces dark brown, ribbed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. Aconitum refractum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>It is also known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum refractum has leaves that are compound, typically with 3â€“5 leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and are usually lance-shaped with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are blue to purple, forming dense clusters at the top of the plant, and are pollinated by insects such as bees; they bloom in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, often growing deep into the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum refractum is primarily native to China South-Central and Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it adapts to the high-altitude environment. It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The species is well-suited to the cold and dry conditions typical of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific regions within China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum refractum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-violet flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native habitats. The plant competes with native species and can alter soil chemistry, affecting ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread across various regions of New Zealand.</p>
