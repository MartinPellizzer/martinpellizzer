                <h1>Acrachne borii</h1>
<p>Acrachne borii, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. It typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats and is often found in tundra ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acrachne borii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrachne borii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a pale green color, growing in a prostrate or creeping pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne borii is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. This plant thrives in dry and sunny environments, typically growing in open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and disturbed ground. It is well adapted to the climate of its native range, which is characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acrachne borii is not commonly found outside of its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne borii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate moisture. This plant is commonly found in the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
