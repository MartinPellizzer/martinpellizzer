                    <h1>Arceuthobium pendens</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium pendens, commonly known as the sticky seed bur, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, sticky seeds that are dispersed by animals or wind. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host, making it a unique example of parasitic adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized nature, it is often found in specific ecological niches where suitable host plants are present.</p>
