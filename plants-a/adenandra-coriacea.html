                <h1>Adenandra coriacea</h1>
<p>Adenandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved adenandra, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery, and often hairy leaves, which provide a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically visited by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Adenandra coriacea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 3 to 8 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas within its native range, though it is primarily found in specific regions of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on rocky outcrops. Adenandra coriacea is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to South Africa, known for its fragrant flowers and dense foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering a more reliable and faster method. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, apply a balanced fertilizer in spring and prune after flowering to maintain shape and promote new growth, while being mindful of potential pests like aphids and diseases such as root rot, which can be mitigated with proper care and companion plants like lavender or rosemary.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in coastal ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological stability of its habitat by supporting a diverse range of organisms.</p>
