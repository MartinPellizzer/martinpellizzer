                <h1>Adenandra coriacea</h1>
<p>Adenandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved adenandra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant has thick, rough, and leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in clusters, and it produces woody pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>Adenandra coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea has leaves that are simple, elliptical in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, bark that is grayish-brown in color and has a rugged texture. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a white color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and mountainous regions within these areas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in dry shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenandra coriacea is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, growing in rocky and sandy soils. This plant is often cultivated in gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. It thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native biodiversity.</p>
