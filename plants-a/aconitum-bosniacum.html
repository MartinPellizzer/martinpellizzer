                <h1>Aconitum bosniacum</h1>
<p>Aconitum bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces egg-shaped, greenish-brown berries that contain toxic seeds. Aconitum bosniacum is known for its high concentration of alkaloids, particularly aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bosniacum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, rough to the touch, and has a greyish-brown bark that is often cracked. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in a dense spike, and consist of five sepals and two petals, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, brown seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bosniacum is primarily native to the Balkan Peninsula, including countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas, particularly in the Dinaric Alps. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often associated with limestone soils. It is part of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bosniacum was mainly introduced to Europe through human activity, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several countries, including Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is also valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens.</p>
