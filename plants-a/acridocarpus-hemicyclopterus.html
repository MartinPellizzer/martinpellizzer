                <h1>Acridocarpus hemicyclopterus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus hemicyclopterus, commonly known as the Malabar spurge, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique floral structures and milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a distinctive feature of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus hemicyclopterus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a straight, branching pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus hemicyclopterus is primarily native to the islands of the Indian Ocean, particularly Madagascar.</p>
<p>This plant is also found in parts of the Comoros and the Seychelles. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. Acridocarpus hemicyclopterus is commonly associated with coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations within the Indian Ocean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus hemicyclopterus was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along forest edges. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a successful invader in many areas. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal contribute to its spread across different ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
