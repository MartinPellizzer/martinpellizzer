                    <h1>Agrostis × torgesii</h1>
<p>Agrostis × torgesii, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, clump-forming grass that typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>It is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
