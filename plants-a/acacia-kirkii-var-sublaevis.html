                    <h1>Acacia kirkii var. sublaevis</h1>
<p>Acacia kirkii var. sublaevis, commonly known as the smooth acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and phyllodes that are narrowly linear and smooth to the touch. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, which are flattened and leaf-like, aiding in water conservation in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
