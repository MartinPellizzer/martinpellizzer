<p>Alisma oligococcum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Alisma oligococcum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
