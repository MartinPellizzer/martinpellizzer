                <h1>Acronia pyelophera</h1>
<p>Acronia pyelophera, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acronia pyelophera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia pyelophera has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pyelophera is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This species is adapted to the humid and subtropical climate of its native range. It is commonly found in areas with rich, moist soil and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important plant in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pyelophera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant has shown rapid growth and spread in these introduced ranges, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its establishment is facilitated by its ability to produce a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a problematic species in several regions where it has been introduced.</p>
