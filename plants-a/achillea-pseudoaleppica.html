                <h1>Achillea pseudoaleppica</h1>
<p>Achillea pseudoaleppica, commonly known as the false yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30–60 cm and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudoaleppica has leaves that are basal, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudoaleppica is a flowering plant native to the mountains of southern Turkey, specifically in the Taurus and Zagros ranges.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Turkey, Iran, and northern Iraq, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats such as steppes and shrublands. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Achillea pseudoaleppica is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudoaleppica is a hardy perennial known for its finely divided, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flower heads.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
