The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
