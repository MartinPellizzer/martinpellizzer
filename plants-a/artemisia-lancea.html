<p>Artemisia lancea, commonly known as slender wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia lancea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
