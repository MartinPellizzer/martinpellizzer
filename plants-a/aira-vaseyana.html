<p>Aira vaseyana, commonly known as the Vasey's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces slender, grass-like blades with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in harsh, arid conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with rocky or dry soil conditions.</p>
