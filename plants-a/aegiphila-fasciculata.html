                <h1>Aegiphila fasciculata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, oval fruits.</p>
<p>Aegiphila fasciculata is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila fasciculata has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a silvery-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a low, spreading manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
