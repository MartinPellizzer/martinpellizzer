<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. collina, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are usually less than 30 cm tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
