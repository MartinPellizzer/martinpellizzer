                <h1>Acourtia scapiformis</h1>
<p>Acourtia scapiformis, commonly known as the scapiform acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acourtia scapiformis is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia scapiformis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia scapiformis is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is often seen in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions in central and southern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia scapiformis was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant white flowers. The plant has since become established in disturbed soils and open habitats, often along roadsides and in dry areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a minor invasive species with limited ecological impact compared to others.</p>
