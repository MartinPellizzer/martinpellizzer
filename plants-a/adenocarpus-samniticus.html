                <h1>Adenocarpus samniticus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus samniticus, commonly known as the Sicilian burr, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a dry, hairy capsule that splits open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus samniticus is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus samniticus has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a tubular corolla, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus samniticus is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly Italy and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Apennine Mountains and other mountainous regions of central and southern Italy. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open woodlands, often growing at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters. It is also present in some areas of Greece and the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus samniticus is a rare and localized species, with limited distribution across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus samniticus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is known for its ability to colonize areas quickly after disturbances, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities that create suitable conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>It is now found in several parts of Europe, particularly in Italy and other Mediterranean regions.</p>
