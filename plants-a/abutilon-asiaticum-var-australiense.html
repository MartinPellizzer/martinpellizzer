<p>Abutilon asiaticum var. australiense, commonly known as the Australian Abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is typically shrub-like, with hairy stems and can grow up to several meters in height. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and colorful blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon asiaticum var. australiense has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are pendulous, with five petals, typically yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a 3-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon asiaticum var. australiense is a variant of the abutilon plant native to Australia, particularly found in the eastern and southeastern regions.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now distributed in various parts of the world, including parts of Asia and the Americas, due to human introduction. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils near water sources. It typically occurs at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status is considered stable due to its adaptability and widespread cultivation.</p>
