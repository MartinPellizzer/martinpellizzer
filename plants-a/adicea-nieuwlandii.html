                <h1>Adicea nieuwlandii</h1>
<p>Adicea nieuwlandii, commonly known as the Nieuwland's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. It produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals, including mammals.</p>
<p>Adicea nieuwlandii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea nieuwlandii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually dark green and slightly serrated.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a creeping or prostrate pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nieuwlandii is primarily native to Indiana.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the central and southern regions of the state. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is known for its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Indiana due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nieuwlandii was mainly introduced to the island of St. Eustatius in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 17th century as an ornamental plant. The species thrives in coastal areas and has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species due to its rapid spread and competition with native flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its distribution and minimize its impact on the ecosystem.</p>
