                <h1>Actephila macrantha</h1>
<p>Actephila macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered actephila, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions in Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Actephila macrantha is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila macrantha has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila macrantha is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It is commonly observed in lowland and mountainous areas across Vietnam.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the country's biodiversity-rich ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila macrantha was mainly introduced to disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded as a result of human activity and seed dispersal through wind and water.</p>
