                        <h1>Acer campbellii var. fantsipanense</h1>
<p>Acer campbellii var. fantsipanense, commonly known as the Fantsipane maple, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the mountainous regions of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its small, clustered flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
