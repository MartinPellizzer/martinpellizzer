<p>Acrostichum scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and marshes of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its long, trailing stems that climb or trail over other vegetation. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize wet, nutrient-rich soils effectively.</p>
<p>Acrostichum scandens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
