                <h1>Acrostichum scandens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and marshes of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its long, trailing stems that climb or trail over other vegetation. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize wet, nutrient-rich soils effectively.</p>
<p>Acrostichum scandens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scandens has elongated, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a lanceolate shape.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, climbing, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slight fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are tiny and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant as it climbs and spreads along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scandens is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant is well adapted to wetland environments and often grows in dense vegetation near water sources. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the region's tropical rainforests and swampy areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scandens was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and salt marshes. This plant has been documented in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its introduction is likely due to natural dispersal through water and wind.</p>
<p>It has become an important part of the local ecosystem, providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
