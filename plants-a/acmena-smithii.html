                <h1>Acmena smithii</h1>
<p>Acmena smithii, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by woody, edible pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular ornamental plant in subtropical and temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a valuable species for reforestation and erosion control.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena smithii has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, having a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena smithii is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of habitats such as rainforests, moist sclerophyll forests, and coastal areas. This plant is commonly found in the subtropical and temperate zones of these regions. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with riparian and woodland environments.</p>
<p>Acmena smithii is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena smithii was mainly introduced to the Australian region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks across eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. The plant's ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade has contributed to its popularity among landscapers and gardeners. However, its introduction has also raised concerns regarding its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic value, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into native habitats.</p>
