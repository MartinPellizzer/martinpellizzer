<p>Angiopteris griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Angiopteris griffithiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
