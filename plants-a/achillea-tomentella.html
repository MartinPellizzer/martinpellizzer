                <h1>Achillea tomentella</h1>
<p>Achillea tomentella, commonly known as woolly yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white woolly foliage and flat clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its aromatic leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Achillea tomentella is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tomentella has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in a dense white tomentum, giving them a woolly appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are generally narrow, ranging from 1 to 3 inches in length, and are arranged in a rosette pattern. The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color, and grows from the base of the plant. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows the seeds to be dispersed by wind.</p>
