<p>Achyropappus depauperatus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial species characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow composite flowers. The plant produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted for survival in harsh, dry environments. Its foliage is typically narrow and gray-green, with a dense covering of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Achyropappus depauperatus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife.</p>
