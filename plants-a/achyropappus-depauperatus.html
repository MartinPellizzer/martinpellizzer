                <h1>Achyropappus depauperatus</h1>
<p>Achyropappus depauperatus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial species characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow composite flowers. The plant produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted for survival in harsh, dry environments. Its foliage is typically narrow and gray-green, with a dense covering of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Achyropappus depauperatus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropappus depauperatus has small, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, branched, and covered with a smooth, grayish bark, growing in a low, spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures that bloom in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The plant produces small, fluffy fruits that disperse seeds via the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted for survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropappus depauperatus is primarily native to Guatemala.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, arid regions of the country, particularly in the western and southern areas. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats such as scrublands and disturbed areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Guatemala, where it adapts to the harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropappus depauperatus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and arid conditions, often due to human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with low precipitation and poor soil quality, where it can thrive in sparse vegetation. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora for resources. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in regions where it has established itself.</p>
<p>It is typically spread through wind dispersal of its lightweight seeds.</p>
