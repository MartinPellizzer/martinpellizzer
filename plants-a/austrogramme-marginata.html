                    <h1>Austrogramme marginata</h1>
<p>Austrogramme marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed austrogramme, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Austrogramme marginata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
