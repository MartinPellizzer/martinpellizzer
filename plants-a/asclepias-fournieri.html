                    <h1>Asclepias fournieri</h1>
<p>Asclepias fournieri, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, orange-tipped clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, green, egg-shaped seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Asclepias fournieri is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant in its native range.</p>
