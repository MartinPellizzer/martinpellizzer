<p>Arenaria lessertiana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sand-flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions.</p>
