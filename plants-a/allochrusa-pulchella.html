                    <h1>Allochrusa pulchella</h1>
<p>Allochrusa pulchella, commonly known as the pretty leafy liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, flat, and often lobed leaves that form a rosette-like structure. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Allochrusa pulchella reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and preference for humid conditions make it a common indicator species in moist, temperate habitats.</p>
