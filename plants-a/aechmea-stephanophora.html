<p>Aechmea stephanophora, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The leaves are thick, waxy, and often have a velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. It produces vibrant red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
