                <h1>Acnistus spathulatus</h1>
<p>Acnistus spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved acnistus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits. Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Acnistus spathulatus is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus spathulatus has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and branching, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus spathulatus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is also present in parts of Madagascar and some regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is often seen growing in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some areas of Southeast Asia and the Americas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus spathulatus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, waste lands, and along riverbanks. The plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major weed in all areas where it is established.</p>
