<p>Alopecurus liouvilleanus, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has fine, hairless leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Alopecurus liouvilleanus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
