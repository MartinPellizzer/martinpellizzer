                    <h1>Aristea tayloriana</h1>
<p>Aristea tayloriana, commonly known as Taylor's artemisia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, daisy-like yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Aristea tayloriana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
