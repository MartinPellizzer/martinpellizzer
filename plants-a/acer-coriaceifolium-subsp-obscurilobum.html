<p>Acer coriaceifolium subsp.</p>
<p>obscurilobum, commonly known as the dark-lobed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with dark green upper surfaces and lighter, sometimes hairy, undersides.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
