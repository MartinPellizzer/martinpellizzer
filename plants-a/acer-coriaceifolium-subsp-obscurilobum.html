                <h1>Acer coriaceifolium subsp. obscurilobum</h1>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium subsp.</p>
<p>obscurilobum, commonly known as the dark-lobed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and paler beneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium subsp.</p>
<p>obscurilobum has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly serrated margin; the leaves are typically 5-10 cm long and arranged singly along the stem. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind; the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium subsp.</p>
<p>obscurilobum is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains, where it thrives in moist, cool microhabitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense forests at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level. The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique subspecies and its fragile ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium subsp.</p>
<p>obscurilobum is a slow-growing, deciduous tree known for its distinctive dark green leaves and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seed or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium subsp.</p>
<p>obscurilobum is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a valuable companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the environment by improving soil structure and supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium subsp.</p>
<p>obscurilobum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits. It has been traditionally used in some indigenous cultures for medicinal purposes, such as treating skin conditions and respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>While it does not have significant industrial or economic applications, its wood is occasionally used for small crafts or fuel. The plant holds cultural significance in certain regions, symbolizing resilience and adaptability in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems, such as providing habitat for wildlife, also contributes to its importance in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer coriaceifolium subsp.</p>
<p>obscurilobum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Kewensis' and 'Crimson King', which are known for their striking autumn foliage. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, producing cultivars that exhibit enhanced growth habits and coloration.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and broader leaf shapes, making them more adaptable to different climates. Horticulturally, this species is important for its contribution to the maple family's genetic diversity and its use in landscape design.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a valuable addition to gardens and public spaces.</p>
