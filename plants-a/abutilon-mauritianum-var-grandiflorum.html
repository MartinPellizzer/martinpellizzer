                <h1>Abutilon mauritianum var. grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Abutilon mauritianum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or the Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon mauritianum var. grandiflorum has broad, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are pendulous, with five lobed petals, typically yellow or orange, blooming from spring to summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon mauritianum var. grandiflorum is native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.</p>
