                <h1>Adelia retusa</h1>
<p>Adelia retusa, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its slender, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Adelia retusa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia retusa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color with a slightly hairy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia retusa is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including sandy soils and rocky plains. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. It is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed areas within its native range.</p>
<p>Adelia retusa is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia retusa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady conditions and spreads rapidly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
