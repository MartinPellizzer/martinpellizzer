                        <h1>Acalypha botteriana</h1>
<p>Acalypha botteriana, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with deep red veins contrasting against its green foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Acalypha botteriana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf patterns and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha botteriana belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and includes species with jointed stems and whorled leaves. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by a wide variety of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large and diverse group of flowering plants that includes many species with unique adaptations such as modified leaves and fruits. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with a wide range of morphologies and often contains latex-producing species. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupplant," characterized by their showy bracts and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha botteriana, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha botteriana is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland areas. The species is known for its vibrant foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha botteriana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several regions across the southeastern United States. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
