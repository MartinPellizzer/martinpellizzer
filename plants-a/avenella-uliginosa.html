                    <h1>Avenella uliginosa</h1>
<p>Avenella uliginosa, commonly known as bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikes of pale brown flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Avenella uliginosa plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife.</p>
