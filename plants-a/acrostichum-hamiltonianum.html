<p>Acrostichum hamiltonianum, commonly known as the Hamilton's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance and adaptability.</p>
