<p>Achyrodes, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly in regions like Namibia and South Africa. The plants are characterized by their striking yellow or orange flower heads, which are often surrounded by a crown-like structure of bracts. Achyrodes species typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with hairy, often aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
