                <h1>Actinocephalus delicatus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus delicatus, commonly known as the delicate star-fig, is a unique plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus delicatus has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. It produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus delicatus is primarily native to the western regions of South Africa, specifically in the coastal areas of the country.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the fynbos vegetation type, which is characteristic of the Cape Floristic Region. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs. Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic area, making it a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus delicatus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the exotic plant imports. The plant thrives in coastal environments and has since spread along the shorelines. It is now considered a noxious weed in some areas due to its invasive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the southern and western coasts of the North Island.</p>
