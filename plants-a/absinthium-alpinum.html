                <h1>Absinthium alpinum</h1>
<p>Absinthium alpinum, commonly known as alpine wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in alpine and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic properties, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a component in absinthe.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium alpinum has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-like formation. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium alpinum is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is now found across much of Europe, including parts of Scandinavia, the British Isles, and the Mediterranean. This species thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Absinthium alpinum is considered vulnerable in some regions, though its conservation status varies by country.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Absinthium alpinum is a hardy perennial herb known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, reaching maturity in its second year and producing flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with occasional compost application, and pruning is recommended after flowering to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests and improve its overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Absinthium alpinum is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in alpine ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and preventing erosion. Its deep root system helps in nutrient cycling, making it beneficial for surrounding vegetation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources in harsh mountain environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Absinthium alpinum is a flowering plant known for its historical and contemporary uses across various domains.</p>
