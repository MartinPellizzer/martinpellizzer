                    <h1>Aristolochia cyclochilia</h1>
<p>Aristolochia cyclochilia, commonly known as the spiral-shaped Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spiral-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces a fragrant, greenish-yellow flower that opens in a helical pattern, a feature that aids in pollination by specific insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical interest and caution.</p>
