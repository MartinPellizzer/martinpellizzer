                    <h1>Astragalus frigidus var. grigorjewii</h1>
<p>Astragalus frigidus var. grigorjewii, commonly known as the cold astragalus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers, typically in clusters, during the short growing season of its alpine habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
