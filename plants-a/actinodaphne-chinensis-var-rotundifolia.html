                <h1>Actinodaphne chinensis var. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne chinensis var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, elliptic to round leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne chinensis var. rotundifolia has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a dense, compact habit. The small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns dark purple when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne chinensis var. rotundifolia is a rare tropical plant native to southern China, particularly in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within its native range due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as lowland evergreen forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne chinensis var. rotundifolia is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its aromatic foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions with indirect light.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are recommended. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like ferns or hibiscus can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne chinensis var. rotundifolia is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
