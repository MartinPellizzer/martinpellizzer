                        <h1>Acalypha livingstoniana</h1>
<p>Acalypha livingstoniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redleaf plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety, red to purple leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Acalypha livingstoniana is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is used in landscape design and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha livingstoniana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in the East African highlands, where it adapts well to the humid and warm climate. It is also known to occur in parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and southern Sudan.</p>
<p>Its natural range is largely confined to these specific geographic areas within Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha livingstoniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in Hawaii in the early 20th century and has since spread to other regions with similar climates. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often escaping cultivation and becoming naturalized in the wild. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora for resources.</p>
