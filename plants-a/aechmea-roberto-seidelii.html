<p>Aechmea roberto-seidelii, commonly known as the Roberto Seidel Aechmea, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall flower spike bearing red and orange bracts, which are showy but not true flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea roberto-seidelii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
