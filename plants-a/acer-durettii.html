                <h1>Acer durettii</h1>
<p>Acer durettii, commonly known as the Durettii maple, is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking foliage, featuring palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters during the spring, while its samaras are distinctive with two wings.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer durettii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer durettii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, with no known cultivation outside its native range. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountain forests and rocky slopes. This species grows at altitudes between 1,800 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer durettii is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer durettii is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer durettii includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and maturation by late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer durettii is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of surrounding vegetation. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer durettii is a species of maple tree native to the Himalayas, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its seeds may have minor traditional uses in some regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and is often found in local landscapes, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer durettii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumnalis' and 'Crimson Queen,' which are known for their vibrant fall foliage and compact growth habits. The species has also been hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce unique varieties with enhanced color and form. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for landscaping and garden design due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer durettii plays a significant role in the world of ornamental plants, contributing to the diversity of maple trees in cultivation.</p>
