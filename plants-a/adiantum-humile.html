                <h1>Adiantum humile</h1>
<p>Adiantum humile, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually over time.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum humile has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and are typically light green in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and somewhat creeping, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows close to the ground. Adiantum humile does not produce showy flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor to moist, shady environments where it thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum humile is primarily native to Belize, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Peru, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. This fern is well adapted to humid climates and thrives in areas with high rainfall. It is often seen in montane and lowland regions across its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans a wide variety of habitats, including stream banks and mountainous terrain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum humile was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported to spread along the edges of waterways and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
