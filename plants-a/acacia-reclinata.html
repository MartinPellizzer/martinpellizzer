                        <h1>Acacia reclinata</h1>
<p>Acacia reclinata, commonly known as the umbrella acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Acacia reclinata is well adapted to drought and can fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in degraded soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia reclinata is primarily native to the dry savannas and grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals.</p>
<p>Acacia reclinata is also known for its ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia reclinata was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ability to provide shade and forage for livestock. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands in several parts of Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly.</p>
