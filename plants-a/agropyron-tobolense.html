                    <h1>Agropyron tobolense</h1>
<p>Agropyron tobolense, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
