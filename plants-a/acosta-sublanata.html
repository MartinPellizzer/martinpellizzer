                <h1>Acosta sublanata</h1>
<p>Acosta sublanata, commonly known as the hairy acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a unique texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Acosta sublanata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta sublanata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly ridged texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta sublanata is primarily native to the high Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and open grasslands within these alpine environments. It is well adapted to the cold and arid conditions typical of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones, making it a characteristic species of the Andean flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta sublanata was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other temperate regions, including parts of Europe and North America, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils have contributed to its invasive potential in some areas. Despite its beauty, it is considered a weed in certain regions due to its competitive nature and difficulty in control.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in native ecosystems.</p>
