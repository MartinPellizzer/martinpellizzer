                <h1>Adelia scandens</h1>
<p>Adelia scandens, commonly known as the climbing arum, is a tropical plant characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It produces striking, spatulate leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, warm environments. It features a showy inflorescence with a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe.</p>
<p>Adelia scandens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia scandens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia scandens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. It is often seen climbing trees or growing along forest edges.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the warm, moist climates of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia scandens was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy environments where it forms dense mats. The plant spreads primarily through its runners, allowing it to colonize large areas quickly. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
