                    <h1>Athyrium angustifolium</h1>
<p>Athyrium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodlands. Its fronds are divided into smaller, finger-like segments, a feature common in the Athyrium genus.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
