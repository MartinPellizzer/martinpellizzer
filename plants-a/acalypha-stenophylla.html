<p>Acalypha stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cuphea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to both landscapes and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha stenophylla has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is upright and branching. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with a distinctive bract-like structure, and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in water and nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha stenophylla is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across tropical rainforests and lowland areas within its native range. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typically found in dense undergrowth. Acalypha stenophylla is commonly found at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha stenophylla is a decorative shrub known for its vibrant, colorful foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's variegation. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 1-2 years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture without becoming waterlogged, with watering every 7-10 days depending on climate. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier growth. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha stenophylla is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil fertility and supporting biodiversity. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
