                <h1>Acorus palmita</h1>
<p>Acorus palmita, commonly known as the broadleaf sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>Acorus palmita is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles in wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus palmita has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically reaching up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows monostichously, meaning it has only one row of leaves along its length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense spikes during the spring, with a simple structure consisting of three sepals and three petals, and it is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-part capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps the plant anchor and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus palmita is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is commonly found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is also present in parts of Africa and the Caribbean, where it adapts to similar moist habitats. It plays an important ecological role in these regions by supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Acorus palmita is often used in traditional medicine and has cultural significance in many of its native areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus palmita was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments in regions with temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in slow-moving freshwater systems such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. This plant is often used for erosion control and water filtration due to its dense rhizome system. It has been introduced in parts of North America, Europe, and Asia as an ornamental and ecological restoration species.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering habitat structures.</p>
