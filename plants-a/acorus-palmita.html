                    <h1>Acorus palmita</h1>
<p>Acorus palmita, commonly known as the broadleaf sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>Acorus palmita is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles in wetland ecosystems.</p>
