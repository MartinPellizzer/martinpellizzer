                        <h1>Acaena laevigata var. venulosa</h1>
<p>Acaena laevigata var. venulosa, commonly known as the smooth woodsetts, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by small, spiky fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Rosaceae family.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena laevigata var. venulosa is primarily native to South Island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and southern regions of the island. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.</p>
<p>The variety is known for its distinctive spiny fruits and is an important component of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena laevigata var. venulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species is now considered invasive in some regions of New Zealand due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can establish itself in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
