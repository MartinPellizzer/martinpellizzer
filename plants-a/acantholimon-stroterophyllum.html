                        <h1>Acantholimon stroterophyllum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon stroterophyllum, commonly known as the Strother's flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with blue to purple flowers. The plant features linear, glabrous leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon stroterophyllum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and their close relatives, characterized by their complex multicellular structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often producing spores. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants like carnations and beets, often with distinctive floral structures. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, characterized by their often blue or purple flowers. Its genus is Acantholimon, a genus of flowering plants typically found in arid regions, known for their spiny or thorny leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon stroterophyllum, a specific type of plant within the genus Acantholimon, adapted to rocky and dry environments, with unique morphological features.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon stroterophyllum is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen in mountainous areas and dry slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Iran, reflecting its specialized requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon stroterophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and dunes, where it can establish itself quickly. This plant is often associated with sandy or gravelly habitats, making it a common invasive species in certain ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can outcompete native vegetation in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and habitat structure.</p>
