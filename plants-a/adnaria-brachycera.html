                <h1>Adnaria brachycera</h1>
<p>Adnaria brachycera, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed adnaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are alternate, finely divided, and often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Native to certain regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria brachycera has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria brachycera is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and saline environments, such as salt marshes and dunes. This plant thrives in regions with high salinity and moderate to warm climates. It is also present in some parts of the Middle East and the western coast of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate harsh, coastal conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria brachycera was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in regions with warm, saline waters.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, sheltered habitats such as lagoons and estuaries, where it forms dense mats that can alter local ecosystems. The plant's introduction has been linked to human activities, including the transport of aquatic plants through ballast water and recreational boating. Its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities have led to its establishment in several new locations beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data on its interactions with native species.</p>
