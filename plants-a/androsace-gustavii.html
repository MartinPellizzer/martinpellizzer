<p>Androsace gustavii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cowslip, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a greenish hue. Its leaves are oval and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Androsace gustavii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
