                    <h1>Astrodaucus</h1>
<p>Astrodaucus, commonly known as the moonflower or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically open at night, emitting a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like moths. The plants are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or arid environments. They have hairy, glandular leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic alkaloids.</p>
<p>Due to their unique blooming habits and ecological role, Astrodaucus species are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
