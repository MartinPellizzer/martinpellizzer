<p>Arenaria capitata subsp.</p>
<p>querioides, commonly known as the sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It features compact, cushion-like growth with small, dense clusters of white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments.</p>
