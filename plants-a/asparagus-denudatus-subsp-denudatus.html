<p>The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, spiny fruits. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
