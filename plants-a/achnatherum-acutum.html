                    <h1>Achnatherum acutum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum acutum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Achnatherum acutum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
