                <h1>Achnatherum acutum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum acutum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Achnatherum acutum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum acutum has narrow, linear leaves that are typically 5–15 cm long and 2–4 mm wide, with a grass-like blade that is flat and slightly rough in texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and smooth, with a bluish-green color, and it grows in dense tufts or clumps. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brown flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry seed enclosed in a bract, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum acutum is primarily native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China, Mongolia, and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, steppes, and open areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in dry to semi-arid climates and is often part of the native vegetation in these regions. It is also present in parts of Europe and North America, where it has been introduced as an ornamental or for forage.</p>
<p>Achnatherum acutum is adapted to cold environments and can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum acutum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and moderate precipitation. This plant has been reported in several states across the United States, particularly in the western and central regions. Its introduction is often associated with human activities that disturb natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can thrive in both dry and moist conditions, making it a successful invasive species in many areas.</p>
