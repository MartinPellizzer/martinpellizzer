                <h1>Acer campestre</h1>
<p>Acer campestre, commonly known as the field maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands, hedgerows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre has oval-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a structure of five sepals and petals, pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the tree has a shallow root system that spreads widely near the surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre is a deciduous tree native to much of Europe, including Britain, France, and parts of Scandinavia, as well as western and central Asia.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends beyond its native range, being cultivated in many temperate regions around the world. This plant thrives in a variety of environments, including woodlands, hedgerows, and open areas, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Acer campestre is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though local populations may be threatened by habitat loss and urban development.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre is a hardy, small to medium-sized tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The growth cycle of Acer campestre is relatively slow, with flowering in early spring and fruiting in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light pruning to maintain shape and promote air circulation.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in poor conditions, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or roses.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem. It acts as a companion plant in hedgerows, enhancing the structure and diversity of plant communities. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its edible fruits can be used to make jams and preserves. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used to treat ailments such as coughs and inflammation due to its astringent properties.

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre has a wide range of varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that make it a popular choice in horticulture.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Columnare', known for its narrow growth habit, and 'Aureum', which features golden-yellow leaves. Hybrids of Acer campestre have been developed to enhance traits such as hardiness, color variation, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids are valued for their ornamental appeal and adaptability to different landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to their aesthetic qualities and ease of cultivation, Acer campestre remains an important species in garden design and urban landscaping.</p>
