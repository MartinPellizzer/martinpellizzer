                <h1>Acer campestre</h1>
<p>Acer campestre, commonly known as the field maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray-brown bark. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer campestre belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, a group of flowering plants that includes trees and shrubs with showy flowers. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes a variety of tropical and temperate species. Its genus is Acer, which consists of deciduous trees and shrubs commonly known as maples, known for their distinctive leaves and colorful autumn foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer campestre, commonly known as the field maple, a small to medium-sized tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre is a small deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed across temperate regions, including parts of North America where it has been introduced. This species thrives in a variety of environments, from woodland edges to open landscapes, and is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its populations are sometimes threatened by habitat loss and urban development.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre is a small, deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with seedlings requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre is a versatile shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies with its showy white flowers. Its dense growth acts as a companion plant, offering erosion control in disturbed soils. The plant also serves as a habitat for birds and small mammals, contributing to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, it helps improve soil structure and supports a healthy ecosystem through its ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre is a versatile tree known for its ecological and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its wood is used in the furniture and construction industries due to its durability and fine grain. The tree also has medicinal applications, with its bark and leaves traditionally used in herbal remedies for their anti-inflammatory properties. In cultural contexts, it symbolizes resilience and endurance, often featured in folklore and landscaping.</p>
<p>Additionally, it provides food for wildlife and supports biodiversity in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre has a variety of cultivars, hybrids, and horticultural significance that make it a popular choice in landscaping.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' with its striking white bark and 'Erectum' known for its upright growth habit. Hybrids of Acer campestre are often created to enhance traits such as flower color, growth form, and disease resistance. These varieties are valued for their ornamental appeal and adaptability to different garden conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer campestre plays an important role in horticulture due to its beauty and versatility.</p>
