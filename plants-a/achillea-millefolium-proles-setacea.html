<p>Achillea millefolium proles setacea, commonly known as the sticky yarrow, is a variant of the common yarrow plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The sticky hairs on its stems and leaves give it its common name and help in water retention.</p>
