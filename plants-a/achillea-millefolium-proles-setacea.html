                <h1>Achillea millefolium proles setacea</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles setacea, commonly known as the sticky yarrow, is a variant of the common yarrow plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in well-drained soils in sunny locations. Its leaves are covered with fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles setacea has compound, finely divided leaves that are feather-like in appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 10 to 30 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, composite inflorescences with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles setacea is a variant of yarrow that is native to Europe, particularly in regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes parts of southern Europe and has been introduced to other temperate regions. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this plant is generally stable, though it may be locally threatened by habitat loss and overgrazing.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles setacea is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental fern-like foliage and long-lasting yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring or fall. The growth cycle begins with spring growth, followed by flowering in mid to late summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape.
