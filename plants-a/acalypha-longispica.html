                        <h1>Acalypha longispica</h1>
<p>Acalypha longispica, commonly known as the long-spined hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiny bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Acalypha longispica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha longispica belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and temperate species with varied growth forms. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse structures and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants known for their showy inflorescences and often used in horticulture.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha longispica, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha longispica is primarily native to Maluku, New Guinea.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of these areas, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. It typically grows in forested environments, often near the forest floor or in shaded undergrowth. The species is well adapted to the rich soil and high rainfall characteristic of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha longispica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the islands in the late 19th century by horticulturalists and garden enthusiasts. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
