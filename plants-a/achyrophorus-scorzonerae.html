                <h1>Achyrophorus scorzonerae</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus scorzonerae, commonly known as the alpine scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus scorzonerae has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are typically 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, hairy texture, while the bark is thin and reddish-brown in color. The flowers are yellow, with five petals and a long, narrow tube, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus scorzonerae is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly associated with arid and semi-arid conditions. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, reflecting its specialized habitat requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus scorzonerae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in grasslands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
