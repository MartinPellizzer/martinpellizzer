                    <h1>Aegialitis annulata var. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Aegialitis annulata var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf sea hibiscus, is a coastal plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are rounded in shape, adapted to retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, often found in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic inundation makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
