                <h1>Adina fauriei</h1>
<p>Adina fauriei, commonly known as the Indian frankincense or Indian myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its resinous exudate, which has been used traditionally in incense and medicinal applications. Its leaves are typically elliptical,革质 (leathery), and have a distinctive aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Adina fauriei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina fauriei has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina fauriei is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments within forests. This plant is commonly associated with mountainous areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Its natural habitat includes dense undergrowth where it competes with other shade-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Adina fauriei is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines, where it contributes to the region's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina fauriei was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It was originally native to South America, specifically Brazil. The plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It has since spread into natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now documented in several states, including Florida, Georgia, and Texas.</p>
