                <h1>Adipe villosula</h1>
<p>Adipe villosula, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the surface. Its leaves are reduced and often scale-like, while the bladders are the primary structures for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Adipe villosula is a carnivorous plant that relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipe villosula has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish bark that exfoliates as the plant matures, and it grows in a sprawling or climbing pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe villosula is primarily native to the eastern regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. This plant is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is well adapted to the warm, humid conditions of the Amazon Basin. It is also occasionally found in parts of Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the rich biodiversity of the South American rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe villosula was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of an ecological restoration project aimed at stabilizing degraded soils and promoting biodiversity.</p>
<p>It was chosen for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, its aggressive spreading has led to concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystems. Despite its benefits, the plant's introduction has sparked debate among conservationists.</p>
<p>Ongoing monitoring is being conducted to assess its long-term ecological effects.</p>
