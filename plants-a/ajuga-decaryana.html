<p>Ajuga decaryana, commonly known as carpet bugle or common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Ajuga decaryana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
