                <h1>Adenophyllum pulcherrimum</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum pulcherrimum, commonly known as the beautiful adenophyllum, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum pulcherrimum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum pulcherrimum is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry to semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland scrub habitats. The species is well adapted to the warm and arid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum pulcherrimum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The species has since spread throughout various regions of the country, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. It is now considered an invasive species in some parts of New Zealand, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have led to increased management efforts to control its spread.</p>
