                <h1>Acmella buphthalmoides</h1>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides, commonly known as the false pincushion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching.</p>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, daisy-like appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually hairy and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and green, with a somewhat woody texture as it matures. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with floodplain vegetation. It is also present in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with rich, moist soils and ample sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains localized compared to other more aggressive invasive plants.</p>
