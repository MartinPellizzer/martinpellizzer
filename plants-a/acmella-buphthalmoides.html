                <h1>Acmella buphthalmoides</h1>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dandelion-like appearance with yellow flowers. The plant has hairy leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow blooms that are followed by bristly seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually green with a smooth surface, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright with a pale greenish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and North America. This species thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring humid and tropical climates. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as data deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its vibrant yellow flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a short growth cycle, blooming within a few months after planting, making it suitable for seasonal gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella buphthalmoides is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Overall, Acmella buphthalmoides plays a significant ecological role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining soil integrity.</p>
