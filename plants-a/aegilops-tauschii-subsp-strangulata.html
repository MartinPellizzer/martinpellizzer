<p>Aegilops tauschii subsp.</p>
<p>strangulata, commonly known as the strangulate wild rye, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is known for its genetic diversity and has been studied for its potential to contribute to wheat improvement through hybridization.</p>
<p>Its robust nature and adaptability make it an important species in agricultural research.</p>
