<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive grayish-green foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which give it a striking appearance. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acalypha canescens is used in traditional medicine and can also serve as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha canescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 6 inches in length, with a bluish-green color and hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth when young and develops shallow fissures with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-lobed蒴果 (capsule) that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soils and helping the plant thrive in disturbed environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha canescens is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acalypha canescens is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not at immediate risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>

<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick establishment. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer, and entering dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
