                    <h1>Asclepias verticillata</h1>
<p>Asclepias verticillata, commonly known as the whorled milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite or whorled leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting pollinators.</p>
