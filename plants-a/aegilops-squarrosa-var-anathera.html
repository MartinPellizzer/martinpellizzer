                    <h1>Aegilops squarrosa var. anathera</h1>
<p>Aegilops squarrosa var. anathera, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to wheat.</p>
