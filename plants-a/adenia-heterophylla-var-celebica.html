                <h1>Adenia heterophylla var. celebica</h1>
<p>Adenia heterophylla var. celebica, commonly known as the Celebes adenium, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, often gnarled stems and dark green, leathery leaves that vary in shape depending on the environment. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia heterophylla var. celebica has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown or reddish-brown, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and stability.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia heterophylla var. celebica is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical islands of Indonesia, particularly Sulawesi and the surrounding archipelago.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific regions within these areas, where it grows in humid, shaded understory environments. It thrives in lowland to mid-elevation forests, typically found at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level. Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenia heterophylla var. celebica is a striking tropical plant known for its vibrant, waxy leaves and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster results. This plant thrives in a warm, humid climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during cooler seasons.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and enhance the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenia heterophylla var. celebica is a significant plant in its native ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds with its attractive flowers, aiding in the reproduction of the plant and supporting local pollinator populations. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species through its presence. Additionally, its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in coastal and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
