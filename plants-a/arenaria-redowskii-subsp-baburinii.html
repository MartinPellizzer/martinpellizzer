<p>Arenaria redowskii subsp.</p>
<p>baburinii, commonly known as the Karakorum sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
