<p>Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia sanguinea has opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are medium to large in size, typically ranging from 2 to 5 inches in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, smooth, and reddish-brown, with a somewhat woody texture, and they grow in an upright, bushy pattern. The flowers are clustered in trusses of tubular, pinkish-white to rose-colored blooms, with a distinctive red throat, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia sanguinea is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, specifically found in regions of China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>Although originally from these areas, it is now widely cultivated and naturalized in temperate regions across North America and Europe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial to full sun, often growing in woodland edges or along stream banks. This plant typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is not considered endangered and is commonly found in gardens and naturalized habitats, though its wild populations in native regions remain relatively stable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia sanguinea is a deciduous shrub known for its vibrant pink flowers and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in late spring or hardwood cuttings in late fall, as well as by seed, though the latter is less common. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or hydrangeas can enhance its beauty and provide mutual benefits in the garden.</p>
