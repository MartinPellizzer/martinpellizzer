<p>Arenaria rubra subsp.</p>
<p>marina, commonly known as the maritime sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, wind-swept conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh maritime climates and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
