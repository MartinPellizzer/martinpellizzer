<p>Anacamptis morio subsp.</p>
<p>albanica, commonly known as the Albanian marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous meadows and marshy habitats, preferring moist and well-drained soils. Its flowers are often arranged in a loose raceme and are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
