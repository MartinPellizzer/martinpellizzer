<p>Aspidium trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as stream banks and forest floors, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Aspidium trifidum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to purify water in aquatic environments.</p>
