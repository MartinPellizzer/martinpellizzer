                <h1>Acantholimon ahangarense</h1>
<p>Acantholimon ahangarense, commonly known as the Ahangar stonecress, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in mountainous and semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acantholimon ahangarense has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged in a basal rosette with a bluish-green color and a length of about 5-10 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing from the base with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, pinkish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon ahangarense is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Iran, specifically in the Alborz Mountains.</p>
<p>It is currently known only from a few isolated populations in the Ahangaran area, indicating a very restricted distribution. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. It grows at elevations ranging from 1,800 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Acantholimon ahangarense is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acantholimon ahangarense is a resilient, flowering plant native to arid regions, known for its attractive, spiky foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune dead foliage after blooming to maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acantholimon ahangarense is a hardy flowering plant that provides essential food and shelter for local wildlife, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant flowers, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant in arid environments, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and promoting the growth of other plant species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acantholimon ahangarense is a lesser-known plant species primarily found in specific regions of Iran, known for its resilience in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary practices, it may hold potential for local food systems due to its nutritional properties. In traditional medicine, it has been explored for its possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation is limited. Its role in ecological systems is significant, contributing to soil stabilization and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in regional folklore, though its broader economic or industrial applications remain under-researched.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acantholimon ahangarense has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albiflorum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking white flowers and variegated foliage. While natural hybrids of this species are rare, some horticulturists have successfully crossed it with related species to create more resilient and visually appealing plants. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in dry conditions and its use in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, A. ahangarense is becoming a sought-after plant in modern garden design.</p>
