<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes pulchella has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tubular with a spurred base, displaying vibrant red or pink hues, and bloom from summer to autumn; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, often developing from the nodes along the stem.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes pulchella is a tropical flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including greenhouse collections and botanical gardens, though it is not widely naturalized outside its original range. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Achimenes pulchella is considered to be of conservation concern, though its exact status is not well documented.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
