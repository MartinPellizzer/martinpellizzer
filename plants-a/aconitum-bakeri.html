                <h1>Aconitum bakeri</h1>
<p>Aconitum bakeri, commonly known as Baker's monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant is characterized by its striking purple or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum bakeri contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bakeri has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed blades that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, and have a spurred shape, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bakeri is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges.</p>
<p>It is found in high-altitude environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions. Its natural habitat includes areas with well-drained soils and limited human disturbance.</p>
<p>Aconitum bakeri is often associated with other alpine flora in these remote, rugged landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bakeri was mainly introduced to the western Himalayas, where it has established itself in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in areas with limited vegetation, competing with other hardy species for limited resources. Due to its striking blue or purple flowers, it has become a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential impacts on native plant communities.</p>
