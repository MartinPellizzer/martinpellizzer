                <h1>Actinostemon unciformis</h1>
<p>Actinostemon unciformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed daisy, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a central disc of yellow florets. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Actinostemon unciformis is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon unciformis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color that may turn reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon unciformis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically regions including Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with limestone soils. Its natural range extends into parts of Indonesia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the warm, humid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon unciformis was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils and along waterways, often spreading through seed dispersal by water and wind. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited by climate conditions and human activity.</p>
