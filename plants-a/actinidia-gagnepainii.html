                <h1>Actinidia gagnepainii</h1>
<p>Actinidia gagnepainii, commonly known as the Gagnepain kiwi, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, edible berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach lengths of up to 10 meters. Its fruit, similar to the common kiwi, is rich in nutrients and has a distinct flavor.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia gagnepainii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 10 cm in length; they are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a climbing vine with a twining habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and inconspicuous, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, blooming in early spring; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, bright red berry that matures in late summer, containing multiple seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, forming a dense network near the soil surface to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia gagnepainii is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>It grows in the mountainous regions of these areas, often in humid, temperate forests. This plant is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Actinidia gagnepainii is a rare species, known for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia gagnepainii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of botanical collections and research initiatives in the early 20th century. The plant has since been cultivated in gardens and conservation areas. However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains limited to specific regions where it is grown intentionally.</p>
