                <h1>Adolia buxifolia</h1>
<p>Adolia buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that remains green throughout the year, giving it a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and year-round interest make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolia buxifolia has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems, with a glossy dark green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures, and they grow in a compact, bushy form. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in spring; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia buxifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland environments with ample rainfall and partial shade. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks in its native range. It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific habitats within Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia buxifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was commonly used in gardens and landscaping for its dense, evergreen appearance. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates contributed to its widespread establishment.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its spread and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
