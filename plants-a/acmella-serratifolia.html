                <h1>Acmella serratifolia</h1>
<p>Acmella serratifolia, commonly known as the saw-toothed sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaves and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella serratifolia has leaves that are serrated, elliptical in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, yellow, and tubular, arranged in clusters, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella serratifolia is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil South, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the region's grasslands and wetlands. It thrives in moist environments and is often associated with riverbanks and marshy areas. The species is well adapted to the temperate climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution highlights its ecological significance in South American ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella serratifolia was mainly introduced to control weed growth in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a biocontrol agent due to its ability to suppress weeds through competition. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions in the Americas. It thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in agricultural landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-target areas.</p>
