                    <h1>Andrachne ephemera</h1>
<p>Andrachne ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Andrachne ephemera is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
