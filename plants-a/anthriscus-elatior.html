                    <h1>Anthriscus elatior</h1>
<p>Anthriscus elatior, commonly known as giant cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and showy white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland edges and meadows. The plant can grow up to 2 meters tall, with a taproot that makes it persistent in the landscape. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
