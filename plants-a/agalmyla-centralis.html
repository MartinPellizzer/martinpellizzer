<p>Agalmyla centralis, commonly known as the central island lily, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the ground. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the island's unique climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agalmyla centralis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
