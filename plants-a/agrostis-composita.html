                    <h1>Agrostis composita</h1>
<p>Agrostis composita, commonly known as the composite bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Agrostis composita is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
