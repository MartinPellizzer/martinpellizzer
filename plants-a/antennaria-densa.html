                    <h1>Antennaria densa</h1>
<p>Antennaria densa, commonly known as the dense hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has short, wiry stems covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Antennaria densa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat.</p>
