                    <h1>Arviela tubispatha</h1>
<p>Arviela tubispatha, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pale purple petals that resemble the glow of moonlight, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, erect stem with few leaves, and its flowers bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, it is classified as an endangered species.</p>
