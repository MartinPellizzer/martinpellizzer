                <h1>Aegilops neglecta</h1>
<p>Aegilops neglecta, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a blue-green coloration.</p>
<p>Aegilops neglecta is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential contributions to wheat genetics and evolution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops neglecta has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like in shape, with a dark green color and a smooth upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a light green color with a slightly hairy texture, growing in a clump-like pattern. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a spike-like inflorescence, typically appearing in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled spikelet that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
