<p>Angraecum africanum, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces showy, white to pale blue petals with a prominent central lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Angraecum africanum is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
