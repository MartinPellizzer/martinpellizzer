                <h1>Acosta bombycina</h1>
<p>Acosta bombycina, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in a fine, silky hair that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Acosta bombycina is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta bombycina has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lance-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length and displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with small, winged seeds released when the capsule splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta bombycina is primarily native to the western regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and lowland areas, where the climate is temperate and the soil is rich in nutrients. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with cloud forests and humid valleys. Its native distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity of the Andes, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acosta bombycina is an important species for both ecological and botanical studies in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta bombycina was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with mild climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been observed in areas with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions outside its original range.</p>
<p>The distribution of Acosta bombycina has expanded due to human activities and environmental changes.</p>
