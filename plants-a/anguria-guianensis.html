<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squashes, and gourds. The plant produces elongated, ridged fruits that are typically green when mature, with a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with five petals.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are generally less commonly consumed compared to other cucurbits.</p>
