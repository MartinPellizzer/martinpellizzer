                <h1>Acinos grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Acinos grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorous pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acinos grandiflorus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes, where it thrives in full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos grandiflorus has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a size ranging from 2 to 6 inches in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a compact, upright pattern. The flowers are showy, composite-type blooms with yellow centers and white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry, achene type, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and attached pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos grandiflorus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and mountainous areas of these states. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open woodlands and chaparral habitats. It is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Acinos grandiflorus is also known as the large-flowered biscuitbrush and is a member of the sunflower family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos grandiflorus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its showy, yellow flowers. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and meadows. It has become naturalized in some parts of its introduced range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal threat to native ecosystems.</p>
