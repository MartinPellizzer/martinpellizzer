                <h1>Acinodendron stenourum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron stenourum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide range of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stenourum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, featuring yellow petals and stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stenourum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with secondary growth forests and disturbed sites. Its distribution is also reported in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Acinodendron stenourum is an important component of the understory vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stenourum was mainly introduced to the southern regions of the United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as part of ornamental horticulture efforts.</p>
<p>It was introduced due to its attractive, waxy leaves and its ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming established in several wetland and riparian areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, its invasive tendencies have led to increased monitoring and management efforts in the regions where it has become naturalized.</p>
