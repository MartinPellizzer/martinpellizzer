<p>Aspidium umbilicatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance.</p>
