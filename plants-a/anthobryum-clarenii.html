                    <h1>Anthobryum clarenii</h1>
<p>Anthobryum clarenii, commonly known as the Clarenii thyme moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closely appressed growth habit and dark green to reddish-brown leaves that are often curved or twisted. The plants typically form dense cushions or mats, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered capsules that are often covered by a persistent calyptra.</p>
<p>This moss is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in soil stabilization and its potential for use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
