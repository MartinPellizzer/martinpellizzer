<p>Angraecum kindtianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features long, slender stems and produces large, fragrant, white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble stars. The plant is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, typically on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth, which is attracted by the nectar and the specific shape of the flower.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
