                    <h1>Alnus incana var. tinctoria</h1>
<p>Alnus incana var. tinctoria, commonly known as the red alder or dye alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves have historically been used for dyeing fabrics and tanning leather.</p>
