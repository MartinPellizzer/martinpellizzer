<p>Axonopus repens, commonly known as carpet grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth that often covers the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. Its narrow, blade-like leaves are typically light green and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Axonopus repens is well-adapted to moist environments and can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
