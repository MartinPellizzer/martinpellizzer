                    <h1>Abolboda neblinae</h1>
<p>Abolboda neblinae, commonly known as the misty fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of mist, which is essential for its growth. The plant features narrow, feather-like fronds that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Abolboda neblinae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
