                        <h1>Acacia doreta</h1>
<p>Acacia doreta, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow to golden-yellow inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. Acacia doreta thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia doreta belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore-producing reproductive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which includes plants with distinctive flowers and often nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its genus is Acacia, a group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorned appearance and the production of legume-like pods.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia doreta, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, distinguished by its unique morphological and genetic traits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia doreta is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the region's arid and semi-arid zones. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acacia doreta is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia doreta was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly established in disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has become naturalized in several countries in the Mediterranean Basin and parts of southern Africa. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and use in traditional medicine.</p>
