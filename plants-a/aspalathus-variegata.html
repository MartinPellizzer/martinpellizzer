                    <h1>Aspalathus variegata</h1>
<p>Aspalathus variegata, commonly known as the rooibos plant, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red-brown pods containing seeds. It is particularly notable for its unique ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Aspalathus variegata is most famous for being the source of rooibos tea, which is caffeine-free and rich in antioxidants.</p>
