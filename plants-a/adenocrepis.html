<p>Adenocrepis, commonly known as the desert aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. Adenocrepis species are typically small shrubs or subshrubs with woody stems and narrow, linear leaves. They produce small, daisy-like flowers that are often blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The genus is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
