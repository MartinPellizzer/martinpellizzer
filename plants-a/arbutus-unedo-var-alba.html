                    <h1>Arbutus unedo var. alba</h1>
<p>Arbutus unedo var. alba, commonly known as the white strawberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, preceding the emergence of its broad, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that ripen in the fall, similar to those of the common strawberry tree. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
