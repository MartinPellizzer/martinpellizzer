                    <h1>Aphanes microcarpa var. bonifaciensis</h1>
<p>Aphanes microcarpa var. bonifaciensis, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, densely packed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>This variety is an important component of dune ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for other coastal flora and fauna.</p>
