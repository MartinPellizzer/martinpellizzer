<p>Asplenium horridum var. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and finely divided, serrated leaflets. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous appearance, which sets it apart from other varieties within the species.</p>
