                <h1>Acridocarpus katangensis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes species known for their toxic properties. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual display. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with elongated leaflets that provide a lush green canopy.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus katangensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that is smooth when young but becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus katangensis is primarily native to DR Congo and Zambia.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is part of the Moraceae family and is known for its unique fruit structure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus katangensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and as an ornamental plant. This species is often introduced for its attractive foliage and potential ecological benefits. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>
