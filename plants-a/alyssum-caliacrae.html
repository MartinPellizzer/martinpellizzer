<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Alyssum caliacrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
