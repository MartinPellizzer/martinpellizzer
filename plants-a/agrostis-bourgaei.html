                    <h1>Agrostis bourgaei</h1>
<p>Agrostis bourgaei, commonly known as the Bog Grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense, low tufts and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in areas with high moisture levels.</p>
<p>Agrostis bourgaei plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
