                <h1>Aegiphila cordata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila cordata has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to purple in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in dry, rocky soils.</p>
