<p>Atriplex vesicaria subsp.</p>
<p>incompta, commonly known as the smooth saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, often glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh landscapes.</p>
