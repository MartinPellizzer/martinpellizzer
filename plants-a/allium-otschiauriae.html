                    <h1>Allium otschiauriae</h1>
<p>Allium otschiauriae, commonly known as the Karakoram garlic, is a rare species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous plant with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, though it is not as widely cultivated as other Allium species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
