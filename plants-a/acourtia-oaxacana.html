                <h1>Acourtia oaxacana</h1>
<p>Acourtia oaxacana, commonly known as Oaxacan acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Acourtia oaxacana is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia oaxacana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny, oval-shaped with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia oaxacana is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. It thrives in rocky and arid environments within these regions. The plant is commonly associated with limestone soils and dry forests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in southern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia oaxacana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several ecological communities.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in most of its range.</p>
