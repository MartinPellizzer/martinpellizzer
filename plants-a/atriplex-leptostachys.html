<p>Atriplex leptostachys, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are succulent and often have a waxy coating, adapted for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Atriplex leptostachys is commonly found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
