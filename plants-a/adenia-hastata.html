                <h1>Adenia hastata</h1>
<p>Adenia hastata, commonly known as the mountain adenia, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features smooth, glabrous stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which are typically borne in clusters. Its fruits are woody, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia hastata is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia hastata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown or greyish-brown, and it grows as an erect shrub or small tree. The flowers are yellow with a distinctive red calyx, arranged in umbels, and they bloom during the wet season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, often forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia hastata is primarily native to Eswatini, KwaZulu-Natal, Mozambique, and the Northern Provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen in the understory of moist, lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of shade and consistent moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia hastata was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical to subtropical climate, characterized by high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in warmer climates. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive foliage and unique flowering structures. It has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand, where it has become a popular choice for horticultural use.</p>
<p>However, its spread is carefully managed to prevent potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems.</p>
