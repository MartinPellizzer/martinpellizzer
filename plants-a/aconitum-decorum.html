                <h1>Aconitum decorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum decorum, commonly known as the velvetleaf monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided and covered in a soft, velvety texture. Aconitum decorum typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters.</p>
<p>It is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum decorum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright, smooth, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, with petals arranged in a spurred structure, and they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
