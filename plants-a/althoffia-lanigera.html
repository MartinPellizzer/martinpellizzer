                    <h1>Althoffia lanigera</h1>
<p>Althoffia lanigera, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which aid in trapping prey. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, and it relies on water for both reproduction and nutrient acquisition. Althoffia lanigera is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants like the sundew and the butterwort.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic environments by capturing and digesting small aquatic organisms.</p>
