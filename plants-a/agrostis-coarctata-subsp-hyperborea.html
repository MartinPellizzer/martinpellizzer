<p>Agrostis coarctata subsp.</p>
<p>hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Arctic and alpine zones. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows. Its flowering stems are usually short and bear small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
