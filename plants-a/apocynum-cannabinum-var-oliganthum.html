<p>Apocynum cannabinum var. oliganthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced floral display compared to the typical form of Apocynum cannabinum.</p>
