                <h1>Abutilon scabridum</h1>
<p>Abutilon scabridum, commonly known as the rough abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often followed by woolly, spherical seed pods.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon scabridum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture and a dark green upper surface that contrasts with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring 5–10 cm in length and 3–6 cm in width. The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, scaly bark that is reddish-brown in color and exhibits a climbing or trailing growth pattern. Its flowers are showy, with a cup-shaped calyx and five petals, displaying a pale yellow to orange color, and they bloom from spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon scabridum is a shrub native to the Caribbean, specifically found in the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, with some populations occurring in cultivated areas outside its original habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in coastal regions or near freshwater sources. Abutilon scabridum is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable, and conservation efforts are needed to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon scabridum is a fast-growing, shrub-like plant native to South America, known for its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer, and entering dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes vigorous growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage flowering. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abutilon scabridum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
