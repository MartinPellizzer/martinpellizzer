                    <h1>Anagallis pumila var. longipedunculata</h1>
<p>Anagallis pumila var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the slenderstalked mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or pale red, arranged in clusters along long, slender peduncles. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated peduncles, which set it apart from the typical form of Anagallis pumila.</p>
