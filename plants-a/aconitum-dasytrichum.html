                <h1>Aconitum dasytrichum</h1>
<p>Aconitum dasytrichum, commonly known as the hairy monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking, hooded blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum dasytrichum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and moderately hairy, with a bluish-green color and a growth pattern that is typically upright and branched. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a longitudinal slit, with seeds that are small, flat, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum dasytrichum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and meadows at high altitudes. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges. It is also occasionally reported in the Russian Altai Mountains and parts of northern China.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum dasytrichum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant spreads through its seeds and rhizomes, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
