                <h1>Adnaria chamissonis</h1>
<p>Adnaria chamissonis, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Adnaria chamissonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria chamissonis has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, have five petals, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria chamissonis is primarily native to the western Pacific Ocean, including regions such as Japan, Korea, and parts of southern China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, often growing in intertidal zones or on rocky shores. This plant thrives in marine environments and is typically associated with submerged or semi-submerged substrates. Its distribution is limited to these specific habitats, making it a characteristic species of the region.</p>
<p>Adnaria chamissonis is not found in other parts of the world, indicating a strong regional endemicity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria chamissonis was mainly introduced to coastal areas along the Pacific coast of North America, particularly in regions with sandy or gravelly substrates.</p>
<p>It thrives in intertidal zones where it can tolerate fluctuating salinity and temperature conditions. This plant is often found growing in dense mats, which can alter local sedimentation patterns and impact native vegetation. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as maritime transport and coastal development.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
