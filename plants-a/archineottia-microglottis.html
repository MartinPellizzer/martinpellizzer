                    <h1>Archineottia microglottis</h1>
<p>Archineottia microglottis, commonly known as the small-glossy lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a pale to dark yellowish-green thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to thrive on various substrates such as bark and stone. It is typically found in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its small, rounded lobes and the presence of distinct, granular structures on its surface.</p>
