<p>Aubrieta alshehbazii, commonly known as the Kashmiri aubrieta, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the mountainous regions of Kashmir.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Aubrieta alshehbazii is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
