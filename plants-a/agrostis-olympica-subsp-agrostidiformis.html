<p>Agrostis olympica subsp.</p>
<p>agrostidiformis, commonly known as the Olympic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique morphological features and genetic differentiation from other Agrostis species.</p>
