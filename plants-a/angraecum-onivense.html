                    <h1>Angraecum onivense</h1>
<p>Angraecum onivense, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from September to December. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Angraecum onivense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
