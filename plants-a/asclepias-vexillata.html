                    <h1>Asclepias vexillata</h1>
<p>Asclepias vexillata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are followed by seed pods that split open to release the characteristic silky seeds. Asclepias vexillata is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which make it toxic to many herbivores.</p>
