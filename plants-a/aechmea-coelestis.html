                <h1>Aechmea coelestis</h1>
<p>Aechmea coelestis, commonly known as the sky flower or blue star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from white to blue, often resembling a star. Its leaves are typically broad, waxy, and have a bluish-green hue with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Aechmea coelestis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea coelestis has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, leathery, and dark green with a metallic sheen, arranged in a compact spiral at the base.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a typical stem, with the leaves forming a dense, compact rosette that protects the central bud. Its inflorescence is a striking violet or purple spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air and soil, typical of epiphytic growth.</p>
