<p>Armatocereus ghiesbreghtii var. oligogonus, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in white, fuzzy spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
