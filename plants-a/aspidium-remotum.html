<p>Aspidium remotum, commonly known as the remote water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fertile fronds, which are usually curled or rolled.</p>
