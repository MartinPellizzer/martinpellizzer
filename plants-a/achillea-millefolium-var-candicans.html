                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. candicans</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. candicans, commonly known as the Showy Yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, showy white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch to gardens.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, historically used for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. candicans has basal leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged in a rosette, with a bright green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, bright yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, with seeds dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. candicans is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in regions of southern France, Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Australia, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, typically at altitudes ranging from 0 to 2,000 meters. Due to its adaptability and widespread cultivation, it is not currently considered endangered, though its natural populations remain relatively localized.</p>
<p>Its presence in non-native regions highlights its ecological flexibility and potential for naturalization.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. candicans is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in early to mid-summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stems to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or rust in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. candicans is a hardy plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also serves as a habitat and shelter for small insects and wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing well alongside other flowering species to enhance garden biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing soil in various environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil health by aiding in nitrogen fixation, though it is not a strong nitrogen fixer on its own.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
