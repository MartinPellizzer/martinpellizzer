<p>Abolboda poarchon var. poarchon, commonly known as the Cloud Forest Orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant prefers cool, humid conditions and is typically found growing on tree trunks or in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
