                <h1>Acer opalus subsp. granatense</h1>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>granatense, commonly known as the granate maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>granatense has palmately lobed leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red or orange in autumn. The leaves are alternate in arrangement, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in catkins during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>granatense is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and southern France. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>granatense is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this tree is relatively slow, with significant development occurring over several years, making it ideal for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>granatense is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion species in mixed forests, enhancing the overall health of the ecosystem. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing landslides.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>granatense is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has potential medicinal applications due to its presence of bioactive compounds, which may support anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Industrially, it is not widely utilized, but its wood could be valuable for fine carpentry or artistic crafts. Culturally, it is appreciated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant for its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and adaptability in certain regional traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>granatense has several popular cultivars, including 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Sanguineum', which are prized for their striking red foliage. It also has hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, resulting in unique ornamental varieties.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit enhanced coloration and improved hardiness. The species is of significant horticultural importance due to its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids are widely used in urban and residential settings for their ornamental beauty and adaptability.</p>
