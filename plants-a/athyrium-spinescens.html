                    <h1>Athyrium spinescens</h1>
<p>Athyrium spinescens, commonly known as the spiny wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, spiny leaflets that give the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
