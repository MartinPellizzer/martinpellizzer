                    <h1>Astorganthus</h1>
<p>Astorganthus, commonly known as the desert star, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that bloom in the evening. Astorganthus species are adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall. They have a shallow root system that allows them to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas.</p>
