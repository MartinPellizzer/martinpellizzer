                <h1>Acoridium globigerum</h1>
<p>Acoridium globigerum, commonly known as the globular water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, rounded leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like structure on the water surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Acoridium globigerum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium globigerum has leaves that are elongated, narrow, and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to yellowish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spadices, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium globigerum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in humid climates with abundant rainfall and is often associated with swampy or flooded habitats. It plays an important ecological role in these environments by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the region's diverse wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium globigerum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and areas with human activity. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate moderate levels of shade. Its introduction has been linked to accidental dispersal through human activities, including the transportation of plant material.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
