<p>Avena sativa var. fusciflora, commonly known as the dark-flowered oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its dark, often purplish flower bracts.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate climates and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and flower structure. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with a distinctive, slightly hairy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated for grain production compared to other oat types but is valued in horticultural settings.</p>
