<p>Abolboda acicularis var. acicularis, commonly known as the slender fringed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
