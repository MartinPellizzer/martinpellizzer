                <h1>Aegle fragilis</h1>
<p>Aegle fragilis, commonly known as the fragile aegle, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of about 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Aegle fragilis is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegle fragilis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a spherical, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to poor soil conditions.</p>
