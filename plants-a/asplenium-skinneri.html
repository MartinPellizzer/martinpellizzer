<p>Asplenium skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Asplenium skinneri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various indoor growing conditions.</p>
