<p>Allocasuarina ramosissima, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are clustered in dense, feathery bundles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a common feature of coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
