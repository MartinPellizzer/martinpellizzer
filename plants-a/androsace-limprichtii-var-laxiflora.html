                    <h1>Androsace limprichtii var. laxiflora</h1>
<p>Androsace limprichtii var. laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
