                <h1>Acer palmatum var. latilobum</h1>
<p>Acer palmatum var. latilobum, commonly known as the Japanese maple with broad leaves, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that are broader and more lobed compared to the typical Acer palmatum. The foliage displays vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in the autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant. It prefers partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively slow-growing and requires protection from strong winds and extreme temperatures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. latilobum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a delicate, finely toothed margin, and a bright green color during the growing season, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, arranged alternately along the stems. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in upright clusters, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. latilobum is a variant of the Japanese maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan.</p>
<p>Historically, it was found in areas with cool, moist climates and partial shade, typically in forests and rocky slopes. Its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and botanical collections worldwide, though it is not widely naturalized outside its native range. It thrives at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters, where it benefits from well-drained soil and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and collection for ornamental purposes, it is considered a species of concern and is often protected in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. latilobum is a decorative maple known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in summer or by sowing seeds in autumn, though cuttings have a higher success rate. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, requiring well-draining, acidic soil and consistent moisture during the growing season. Regular fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care and companion plants like hostas or ferns.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. latilobum is a decorative ornamental plant that provides aesthetic value and contributes to ecological balance by offering food and shelter to various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in garden settings, enhancing the visual appeal of landscapes.
