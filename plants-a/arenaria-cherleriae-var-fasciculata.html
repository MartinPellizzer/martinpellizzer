                    <h1>Arenaria cherleriae var. fasciculata</h1>
<p>Arenaria cherleriae var. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in tight clusters, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
