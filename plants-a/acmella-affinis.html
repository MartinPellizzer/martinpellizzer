                <h1>Acmella affinis</h1>
<p>Acmella affinis, commonly known as the spiny golden crown, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking, spiky yellow flowers that resemble a crown. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets.</p>
<p>Acmella affinis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can also serve as a habitat for various small insects and pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella affinis has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow, and consist of four petals arranged in a cross shape, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella affinis is primarily native to Central and South America, including regions such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, organic soil, often near water sources. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Acmella affinis is also found in some parts of the Caribbean and has been introduced to other regions for ornamental or medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella affinis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant, colorful flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it adds visual appeal with its unique blooms. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is also occasionally used in horticultural research for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
