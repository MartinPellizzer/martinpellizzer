                <h1>Acineta wolteriana</h1>
<p>Acineta wolteriana, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. Its flowers, typically white or pale pink, are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Acineta wolteriana is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh, mountainous climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta wolteriana has leaves that are simple, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta wolteriana is primarily native to South America, specifically in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. It is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta wolteriana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. Its introduction to new habitats has led to its establishment in some non-native locations, though it is not widely invasive.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
