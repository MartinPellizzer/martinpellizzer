                <h1>Acalypha psilostachya var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Acalypha psilostachya var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha psilostachya var. glandulosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a glossy green color and serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and greenish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern that is relatively upright. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white bracts and stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp, dispersing seeds by wind after the fruit splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha psilostachya var. glandulosa is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of East and Central Africa, though its presence has become more fragmented due to habitat loss. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland to hillside environments, often found in forest edges or disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this plant is listed as vulnerable due to habitat degradation and overharvesting for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
