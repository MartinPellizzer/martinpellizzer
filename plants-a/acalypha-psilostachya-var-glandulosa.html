                        <h1>Acalypha psilostachya var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Acalypha psilostachya var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular acalypha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful foliage. The plant features palmate leaves with a soft, velvety texture and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves give it its scientific name, reflecting its unique botanical features.</p>
