                <h1>Aconitum × speciosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum × speciosum, commonly known as the hybrid garden aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, spiky blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are palmately arranged, giving it a dramatic appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × speciosum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a distinctive hooded shape, blooming in summer (July to August) and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, contributing to the plant's hardiness and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
