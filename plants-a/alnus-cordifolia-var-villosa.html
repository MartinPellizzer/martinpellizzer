                    <h1>Alnus cordifolia var. villosa</h1>
<p>Alnus cordifolia var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological landscaping.</p>
