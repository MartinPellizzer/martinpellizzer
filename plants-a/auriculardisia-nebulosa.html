<p>Auriculardisia nebulosa, commonly known as the clouded ear orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ear-shaped petals that are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling clouds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are usually a mix of white and pale purple, creating a visually stunning display.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
