<p>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp.</p>
<p>crassifolius, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces red or orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping.</p>
