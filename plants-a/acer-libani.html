                <h1>Acer libani</h1>
<p>Acer libani, commonly known as the Lebanon maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with three to five pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky and arid soils, making it a hardy species found in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer libani has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to the rocky and arid environments where it commonly grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer libani is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It currently grows in scattered populations across its native range, though its distribution has been reduced due to habitat loss and environmental changes. This species thrives in dry, rocky slopes and limestone formations, often in sunny, well-drained soils. Acer libani is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered a vulnerable species due to threats such as deforestation, urbanization, and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer libani is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy and ensure successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer libani includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by summer foliage and autumn color change before entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and remove dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or root rot, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or rosemary in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer libani is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a natural erosion control agent due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil in mountainous regions. Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native flora.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is essential in maintaining the balance of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer libani is a species of maple tree native to the Eastern Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and cabinetry. In traditional medicine, various parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in some regions, representing resilience and endurance.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to local forestry and horticulture industries, supporting sustainable land management practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer libani has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Cascade' and 'Summer Snow,' which are prized for their distinctive foliage and ornamental value. Hybrids of Acer libani are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness, disease resistance, and seasonal color. These cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of maple trees in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to thrive in various climates and add visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
