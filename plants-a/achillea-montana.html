                <h1>Achillea montana</h1>
<p>Achillea montana, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and produces flat, clustered flower heads that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in dry meadows and rocky soils. It is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Achillea montana is also a popular garden plant due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea montana has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and have a rough texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a grayish-green bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. The flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea montana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, including countries such as Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northwest Africa and the Middle East. This plant typically grows in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and dry grasslands at high elevations. Its distribution is closely associated with temperate climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly known as the mountain yarrow and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea montana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and open woodlands. It is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is still valued for its ecological and aesthetic benefits in certain environments.</p>
