                <h1>Acrostichum pubens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pubens, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its feathery, delicate fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome with hairy, glandular structures that give it its common name. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a light green color and a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pubens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pubens has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slight fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it matures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pubens is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, moist soil, often found near rivers and in swampy habitats. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and brackish water environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic and environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pubens was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, construction sites, and areas with frequent human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade to full sun. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can spread rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous spores. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
