<p>Achillea lanulosa subsp.</p>
<p>alpicola, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it tolerates cold and poor conditions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies alpicola is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flower heads compared to other members of the species.</p>
