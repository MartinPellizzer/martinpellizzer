                    <h1>Aechmea involucrifera</h1>
<p>Aechmea involucrifera, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, often lasting several months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, fuzzy coating that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea involucrifera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
