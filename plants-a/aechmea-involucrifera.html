                <h1>Aechmea involucrifera</h1>
<p>Aechmea involucrifera, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, often lasting several months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, fuzzy coating that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea involucrifera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea involucrifera has leaves that are long, sword-shaped, and arranged in a rosette, with a waxy surface and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, dark green bark. Its flowers are clustered in a panicle inflorescence, featuring bright red bracts and small white flowers, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in the soil and absorbing moisture.</p>
