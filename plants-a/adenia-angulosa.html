                    <h1>Adenia angulosa</h1>
<p>Adenia angulosa, commonly known as the angular adenium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring thick, angular stems covered in a rough, bark-like texture. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically elliptical or lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenia angulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
