                <h1>Adenia angulosa</h1>
<p>Adenia angulosa, commonly known as the angular adenium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring thick, angular stems covered in a rough, bark-like texture. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically elliptical or lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenia angulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia angulosa has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. Its flowers are large, showy, and consist of five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, displaying a striking yellow color, and they bloom during the spring and summer, primarily pollinated by birds. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia angulosa is primarily native to Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. The plant typically grows in forested areas and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia angulosa was mainly introduced to coastal areas and rocky outcrops in southern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is commonly found in regions such as Western Australia and South Australia. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering pattern.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some environments due to its rapid growth and spread.</p>
