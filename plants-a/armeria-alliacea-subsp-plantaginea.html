<p>Armeria alliacea subsp.</p>
<p>plantaginea, commonly known as the woolly sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or shingle soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
