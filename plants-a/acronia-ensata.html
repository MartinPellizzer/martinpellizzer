<p>Acronia ensata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically broad and have a distinctive notched base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Acronia ensata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
