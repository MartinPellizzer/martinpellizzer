                    <h1>Amygdalus dehiscens</h1>
<p>Amygdalus dehiscens, commonly known as the desert almond, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a thick, woody hull. Its seeds, once the hulls have dehisced, are edible and have a nutty flavor similar to almonds.</p>
<p>Amygdalus dehiscens is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
