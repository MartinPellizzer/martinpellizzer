<p>Acer negundo, commonly known as the box elder, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the maple family (Aceraceae) and is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement and three to five lobes on its leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It is often found in moist soils along rivers and streams, and it can grow in a variety of habitats including urban environments.</p>
<p>The box elder is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate pollution, making it a common sight in city landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo has leaves that are simple, opposite in arrangement, and typically ovate to cordate in shape, with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 5â€“10 cm in length, and they change from a dark green in summer to a vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a straight growth pattern and a somewhat flaky bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two papery wings that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting well to a variety of soil types.</p>
