                <h1>Acer negundo</h1>
<p>Acer negundo, commonly known as the box elder, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the maple family (Aceraceae) and is characterized by its palmate leaves that resemble those of other maple species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It is often found in wetland areas and along riverbanks due to its tolerance for moist soils.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and typically displaying a bright green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, ascending pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes during the spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed that is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, often forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It has been widely introduced and now grows in various parts of Europe, Asia, and even some regions of Africa. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in riparian zones, floodplains, and along streams. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from near sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, it is sometimes classified as invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo is a fast-growing tree commonly known as the box elder, which thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained loam.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer negundo is rapid, with young trees reaching maturity in about 10 years, producing yellow foliage in the fall.</p>
<p>For proper care, it requires regular watering during dry periods and moderate fertilization in early spring to support healthy growth. Pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead branches, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like clover can enhance soil fertility and promote overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo is a fast-growing tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as an effective erosion control plant due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil. The tree also serves as a companion plant in reforestation efforts, helping to establish a more diverse ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to improving air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer negundo is a versatile plant with various uses and applications.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The wood of the plant is valued in the industrial sector for its durability and is used in construction and furniture making. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, often representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as an ornamental plant in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and fast growth rate.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer negundo has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sanguszko' and 'Crimson King,' which are known for their vibrant autumn colors and unique foliage patterns. The species is also used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with improved traits such as disease resistance and enhanced coloration. These hybrids contribute to the diversity in horticulture, offering gardeners a range of options for landscaping and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer negundo holds significant horticultural importance due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
