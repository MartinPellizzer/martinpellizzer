                <h1>Achillea seidlii</h1>
<p>Achillea seidlii, commonly known as the Balkan yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink in color. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are aromatic and finely divided, contributing to its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Achillea seidlii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea seidlii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette pattern and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to form a compact shrub. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried over long distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea seidlii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, specifically in the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of the region. It is often found in association with other alpine flora, contributing to the biodiversity of these high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the Caucasus.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea seidlii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other parts of Europe and has been reported in several countries, including Italy, France, and Spain. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can become invasive in certain areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions have led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
