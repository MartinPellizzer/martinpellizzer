<p>Abumon africanum, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as agricultural fields and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
