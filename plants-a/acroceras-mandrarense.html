                <h1>Acroceras mandrarense</h1>
<p>Acroceras mandrarense, commonly known as the Mediterranean sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acroceras mandrarense is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras mandrarense has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are small and winged for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras mandrarense is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This rare plant is found in specific regions of the island, particularly in the eastern rainforests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil. Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras mandrarense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wetland habitats. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread in natural areas.</p>
