<p>Agave multifilifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and long, narrow, blue-green leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. The plant produces an impressive inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Agave multifilifera is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
