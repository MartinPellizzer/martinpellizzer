<p>Abrahamia grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
