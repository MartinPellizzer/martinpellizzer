                    <h1>Acacia candolleana</h1>
<p>Acacia candolleana, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its hardy nature makes it well-suited for dry climates and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The wood of Acacia candolleana is also valued for its durability and is used in traditional crafts.</p>
