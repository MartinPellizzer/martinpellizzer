<p>Artemisia vulgaris var. rotundatiloba, commonly known as round-leaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with rounded, broad leaves that distinguish it from the more commonly known Artemisia vulgaris. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
