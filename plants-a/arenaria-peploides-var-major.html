<p>Arenaria peploides var. major, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in dunes, gravelly soils, and along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
