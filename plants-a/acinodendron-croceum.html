                <h1>Acinodendron croceum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron croceum, commonly known as the golden acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron croceum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron croceum is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverine habitats. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is also occasionally reported in parts of southern Arabia.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron croceum was mainly introduced to areas where its ornamental value and adaptability to disturbed soils make it suitable for landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in urban environments, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats such as construction sites and abandoned fields. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful establishment in new regions. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into sensitive ecosystems.</p>
