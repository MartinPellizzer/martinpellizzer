                <h1>Achyrocline gardneri</h1>
<p>Achyrocline gardneri, commonly known as the gardenia of the Caribbean, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are showy, with yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets.</p>
<p>Achyrocline gardneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in coastal and disturbed habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline gardneri has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline gardneri is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. It is commonly associated with dry to moist forests and open habitats in these areas. The species is adapted to the climatic conditions of these regions, including seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific parts of Brazil, reflecting its ecological preferences and historical distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline gardneri was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various habitats, including coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant outcompetes native vegetation, leading to a decline in biodiversity. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it particularly problematic in conservation areas.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread through manual removal and herbicide application.</p>
