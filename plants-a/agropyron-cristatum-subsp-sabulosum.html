<p>Agropyron cristatum subsp.</p>
<p>sabulosum, commonly known as the sand wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with the lower glumes being shorter than the upper ones. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
