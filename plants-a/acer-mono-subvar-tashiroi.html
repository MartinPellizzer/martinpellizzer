<p>Acer mono subvar. tashiroi, commonly known as the Tashiro's maple, is a rare and unique variant of the Japanese maple.</p>

The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the mountainous regions of Japan. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
