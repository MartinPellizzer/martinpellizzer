<p>Arundo lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, riverbanks, and wet meadows. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Arundo lapponica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
