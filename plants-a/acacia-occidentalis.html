                        <h1>Acacia occidentalis</h1>
<p>Acacia occidentalis, commonly known as the western acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for coastal and rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia occidentalis is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, including parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, rocky hills, and dry coastal plains. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in association with other drought-tolerant vegetation. It is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a common sight in desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acacia occidentalis is also known as the Arabian thorn acacia and plays a role in local biodiversity and traditional land use.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia occidentalis was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. This plant is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh environments and its potential for use in land rehabilitation projects. Its introduction has also provided habitat for local wildlife and supported biodiversity in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native ecosystems.</p>
