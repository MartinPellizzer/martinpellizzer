                    <h1>Austroblechnum × aggregatum</h1>
<p>Austroblechnum × aggregatum, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Austroblechnum squalidum and Austroblechnum scolopendrium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant forms dense, clump-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a graceful, arching appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and is propagated vegetatively.</p>
