<p>Asyneuma, commonly known as the "blueweed," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, blue or purple flower heads, which are typically composed of numerous tiny florets. Asyneuma species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. They possess a hairy stem and leaves, which help reduce water loss in their often harsh habitats.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
