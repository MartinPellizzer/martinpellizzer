<p>Asplenium × staufferi nothosubsp.</p>
<p>moravicum, commonly known as the Moravian maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria, showcasing a combination of traits from both parent species.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense, compact rosettes of lanceolate, dark green, and glossy leaves with a distinctive frond structure. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments.</p>
