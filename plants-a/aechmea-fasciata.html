<p>Aechmea fasciata, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant produces a tall flower spike that can reach several feet in height, bearing vibrant orange or red flowers. Its foliage is often marked with distinctive silver or white stripes, giving it a striking appearance.</p>
<p>Aechmea fasciata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
