<p>Aconitum geraniifolium, commonly known as the garden aconite or the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of geranium, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Aconitum geraniifolium is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
