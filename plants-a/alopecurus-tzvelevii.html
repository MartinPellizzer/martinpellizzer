                    <h1>Alopecurus tzvelevii</h1>
<p>Alopecurus tzvelevii, commonly known as the Tzvelev's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Alopecurus tzvelevii is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a resilient choice for landscaping and conservation efforts.</p>
