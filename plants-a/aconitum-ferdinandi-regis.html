                <h1>Aconitum ferdinandi-regis</h1>
<p>Aconitum ferdinandi-regis, commonly known as the Ferdinand Regis monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. The plant is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-like shape. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive appearance, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it both a potent and potentially dangerous species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum ferdinandi-regis has large, compound leaves that are palmately divided with a deep green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and greenish-blue in color, with a growth pattern that is typically upright and unbranched. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred shape, and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum ferdinandi-regis is primarily native to the NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen. This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the western Balkans, including parts of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forested areas and along stream banks. The species is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of this region. Its distribution is limited to these specific habitats within the NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum ferdinandi-regis was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought to North America in the late 19th century by botanists and horticulturists interested in cultivating exotic species. The plant has since been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections across the country, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. However, it is considered non-native and has not established itself as an invasive species in the wild.</p>
<p>Its introduction has contributed to the diversity of cultivated plants in the region but remains primarily confined to garden settings.</p>
