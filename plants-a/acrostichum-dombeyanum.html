                <h1>Acrostichum dombeyanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum dombeyanum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically golden to brown in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are composed of numerous small, overlapping pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum dombeyanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum dombeyanum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad, leathery, and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is robust and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in late summer, and is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum dombeyanum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often near rivers and in coastal areas. It is typically associated with mangrove ecosystems and swampy lowlands.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into some parts of the Caribbean as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum dombeyanum was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and consistent water availability, such as marshes and along riverbanks. This plant is often associated with disturbed or reclaimed land, where it can establish quickly due to its rapid growth rate. Its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
