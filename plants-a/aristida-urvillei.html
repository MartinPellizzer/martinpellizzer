                    <h1>Aristida urvillei</h1>
<p>Aristida urvillei, commonly known as the Urville's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Aristida urvillei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
