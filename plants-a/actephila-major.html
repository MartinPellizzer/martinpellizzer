                <h1>Actephila major</h1>
<p>Actephila major, commonly known as the large greenbrier, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its thorny stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Actephila major is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila major has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a light brown color, growing in a spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila major is a flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While its native range is well-defined, its current distribution has expanded due to human introduction, with populations now present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks, often growing in rich, humus-filled soils. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss from deforestation and land conversion.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actephila major is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Actephila major involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actephila major is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers, supporting biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Actephila major contributes to nutrient cycling by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
