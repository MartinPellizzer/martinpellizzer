                <h1>Actephila major</h1>
<p>Actephila major, commonly known as the large-leaved actephila, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Actephila major is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila major has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila major is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils in forest understories. Its distribution extends to parts of the Pacific Islands, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a relatively rare plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila major was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It spreads through both seeds and vegetative growth, making it a persistent invasive species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems.</p>
