<p>Amygdalus bilinica, commonly known as the two-colored almond.</p>
<p>It is a species of shrub native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its small, oval leaves and pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, stone fruits with a thin skin and a sweet, nutty flavor. It is closely related to the common almond (Prunus dulcis) and shares similar botanical features.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated due to its smaller size and lower fruit yield compared to other almond species.</p>
