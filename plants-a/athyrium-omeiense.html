<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
