<p>Achmandra conocarpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Achmandra conocarpa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra conocarpa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, consisting of four petals and four sepals, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
