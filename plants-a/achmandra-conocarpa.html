                <h1>Achmandra conocarpa</h1>
<p>Achmandra conocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican whiteflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra conocarpa has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, consisting of five petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra conocarpa is primarily native to the high Andean regions of southern Peru and northern Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is found in the valleys and slopes of the Andes, typically at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. It is commonly found in shrublands and grasslands within its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones in the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra conocarpa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there by horticulturists and gardeners who sought to diversify the local flora with exotic species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt the ecological balance.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its spread and manage its impact on native biodiversity.</p>
