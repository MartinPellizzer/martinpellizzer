                <h1>Adicea trichosanthes</h1>
<p>Adicea trichosanthes, commonly known as the Chinese yam or wild yam, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into oval, tuberous fruits. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Adicea trichosanthes is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea trichosanthes has leaves that are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are yellow with orange markings, consisting of five petals and five sepals, blooming in summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea trichosanthes is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often associated with forest understories and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Indonesia and the Philippines as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea trichosanthes was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or medicinal plant.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Americas. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on native flora.</p>
