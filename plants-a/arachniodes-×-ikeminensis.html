<p>Arachniodes × ikeminensis, commonly known as the ikeminensis fern, is a hybrid species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive pattern of finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
