                    <h1>Aristida arizonica</h1>
<p>Aristida arizonica, commonly known as Arizona threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with silky hairs, which aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Arizona threeawn is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
