<p>[WRONG START] Acantholippia punensis, commonly known as the Pun√© thornbush, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
