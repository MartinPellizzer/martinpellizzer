<p>Aristolochia australopithecurus, commonly known as the Australian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which are typically borne in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators like flies and beetles.</p>
<p>The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant potentially hazardous.</p>
