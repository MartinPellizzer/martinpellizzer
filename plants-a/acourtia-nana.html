                <h1>Acourtia nana</h1>
<p>Acourtia nana, commonly known as the dwarf acourtia, is a small flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal and inland desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia nana has small, basal leaves that are rounded and slightly hairy, arranged in a rosette pattern, with a diameter of about 2-3 centimeters and a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows close to the ground. The flowers are small, yellowish-green structures clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when the capsule splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia nana is primarily native to Arizona, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southwest, New Mexico, and Texas.</p>
<p>This small annual plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open habitats such as grasslands and desert scrub. The species is well adapted to the dry climate and fluctuating temperatures of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia nana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is often associated with areas that have been disturbed by human activity, such as logging or urban development. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species in some areas.</p>
<p>Acourtia nana is considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly.</p>
