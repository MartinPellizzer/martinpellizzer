                <h1>Acourtia nana</h1>
<p>Acourtia nana, commonly known as the dwarf acourtia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and compact stature. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Acourtia nana is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia nana has small, hairy, alternate leaves that are oval in shape, typically less than 2 cm in length, with a pale green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains unbranched. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia nana is a small annual herb native to the western United States, primarily found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Pacific Northwest, though its range has become fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, open environments such as grasslands and woodland edges, often near streams or in shaded areas. Acourtia nana typically grows at low to middle elevations, ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from development and invasive species, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as endangered in some states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acourtia nana is a small, flowering plant known for its delicate appearance and easy care requirements.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method often resulting in faster growth. The growth cycle of Acourtia nana is relatively short, with flowering occurring within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acourtia nana is a low-growing flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and foraging opportunities. The plant acts as a companion plant in coastal ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting other native species. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion along shorelines and dunes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acourtia nana contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility through its root system.</p>
