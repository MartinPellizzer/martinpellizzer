                <h1>Adiantum microsorum</h1>
<p>Adiantum microsorum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum microsorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum microsorum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, pinnately arranged, and typically measure 10-20 cm in length, with a bright green color and a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, upright stem with a smooth, light brown bark that grows from the base of the plant. It does not produce true flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and instead reproduces through the release of spores from the undersides of its fronds. The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant to the soil, aiding in water and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The plant lacks fruits and seeds, relying solely on spore dispersal through wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum microsorum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream sides. This fern thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with mountainous regions. It is also present in parts of Australia and New Zealand, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Adiantum microsorum is a popular ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum microsorum was mainly introduced to wetlands, stream banks, and shaded forest floors where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions with high humidity and partial to full shade. This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native areas.</p>
<p>It prefers moderate temperatures and can tolerate light frost in its native habitat.</p>
