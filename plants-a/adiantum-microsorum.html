<p>Adiantum microsorum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum microsorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
