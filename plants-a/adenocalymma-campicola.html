                <h1>Adenocalymma campicola</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma campicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma campicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma campicola has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma campicola is primarily native to the southern regions of South America, specifically Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical and temperate zones of these countries. This plant thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often growing in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Its distribution is closely associated with specific soil types and climatic conditions found in these regions.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma campicola is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma campicola was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and rocky outcrops, particularly in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with fynbos vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activities, such as accidental transport or intentional planting.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
