                    <h1>Acantholimon gracillimum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon gracillimum, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, such as slopes and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Acantholimon gracillimum is also notable for its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats, making it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
