<p>Aridaria congesta, commonly known as the clustered arid flora, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Aridaria congesta is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
