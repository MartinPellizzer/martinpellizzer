                    <h1>Arundo montana</h1>
<p>Arundo montana, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a stiff, fibrous structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in some regions.</p>
