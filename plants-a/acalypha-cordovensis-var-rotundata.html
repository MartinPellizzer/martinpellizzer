<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha cordovensis var. rotundata has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers with stamens that bloom during the summer months, and it is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cordovensis var. rotundata is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in the island of Hispaniola, which includes the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other tropical regions, including parts of southern Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along streambanks. It typically grows at elevations between 0 and 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha cordovensis var. rotundata is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, colorful bracts and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most effective method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage branching are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
