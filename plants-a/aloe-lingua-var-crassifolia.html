<p>Aloe lingua var. crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, upright leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tint and may bear small white spots or teeth along the edges. It produces yellow flowers in racemes during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
