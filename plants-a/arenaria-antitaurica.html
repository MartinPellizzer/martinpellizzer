                    <h1>Arenaria antitaurica</h1>
<p>Arenaria antitaurica, commonly known as the Taurus sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Taurus Mountains in Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, often found on slopes and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Arenaria antitaurica is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
