                    <h1>Asplenium douglasii</h1>
<p>Asplenium douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil in temperate regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium douglasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
