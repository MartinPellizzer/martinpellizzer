                <h1>Acinodendron discolor</h1>
<p>Acinodendron discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered acinodendron, is a member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron discolor is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron discolor has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slight pubescence on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron discolor is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing in shaded understory environments. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron discolor was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 20th century by horticulturists and garden enthusiasts seeking exotic plant species. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its population to prevent further ecological damage.</p>
