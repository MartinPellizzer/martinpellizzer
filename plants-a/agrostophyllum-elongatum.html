                    <h1>Agrostophyllum elongatum</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum elongatum, commonly known as the slender leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish-green upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
