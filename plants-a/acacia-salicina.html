                    <h1>Acacia salicina</h1>
<p>Acacia salicina, commonly known as the river red gum, is a large, deciduous tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and striking red bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellow globular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia salicina is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands.</p>
