                    <h1>Alopecurus pratensis var. muticus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus pratensis var. muticus, commonly known as the mute meadow grass, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and wetlands, thriving in well-drained to slightly wet soils. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and dense growth, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
