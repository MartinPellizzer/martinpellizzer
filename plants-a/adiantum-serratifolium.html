                <h1>Adiantum serratifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum serratifolium, commonly known as the notched maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that have serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage.</p>
<p>Adiantum serratifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum serratifolium has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged pinnately, and typically measure 20â€“30 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a spreading pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in loose clusters. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum serratifolium is primarily native to Borneo and Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments along forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these islands.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other epiphytic plants.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum serratifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported to spread along the edges of wetlands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
