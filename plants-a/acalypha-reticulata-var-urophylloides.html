The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha reticulata var. urophylloides is a flowering plant native to the island of Borneo, specifically found in the lowland rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and limited propagation efforts. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and rich, well-drained soil. This variety typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha reticulata var. urophylloides is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in a warm, humid climate, entering a dormant phase during colder months, though it can be grown indoors year-round with proper care.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, fertile soil and consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental display.</p>
