<p>Acaena leptacantha subsp.</p>
<p>connectens, commonly known as the slender bristled weed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, spiny leaves and produces spherical, yellowish-brown fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in coastal and inland sandy soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are typically inconspicuous, with stamens that are often longer than the petals.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and robust, thorn-like structures.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
