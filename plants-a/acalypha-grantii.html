                        <h1>Acalypha grantii</h1>
<p>Acalypha grantii, commonly known as the red-flowered croton, is a shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small yellow flowers, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha grantii is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Yemen.</p>
<p>This unique plant thrives in the arid and rugged terrain of Socotra, where it has adapted to the extreme environmental conditions. It is found in rocky areas and along the coastal regions, often growing in sparse vegetation. The plant is part of the native flora that contributes to the distinctive biodiversity of Socotra.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha grantii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas where it can thrive. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its establishment in non-native habitats. However, its impact on local ecosystems remains minimal compared to more invasive species.</p>
<p>It is generally considered a low-risk plant for ecological disruption in New Zealand.</p>
