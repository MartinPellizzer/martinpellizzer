                <h1>Actaea alba</h1>
<p>Actaea alba, commonly known as white crowfoot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a stout, unbranched stem that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Actaea alba is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea alba has large, compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces upright, panicle-like inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cluster of small, red berries that disperse their seeds through bird ingestion and droppings, and the roots are tuberous and fibrous, aiding in the plant's survival in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea alba is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests and shaded wetlands. This plant thrives in regions with cool, temperate climates and is often associated with rich, loamy soils. It is particularly prevalent in the Appalachian region and parts of the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>Actaea alba is also found in some areas of southeastern Canada, including Ontario and Quebec.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea alba was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental introduction.</p>
<p>It has established populations in several regions, including the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological effects.</p>
