                    <h1>Arceuthobium campylopodum f. divaricatum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum f. divaricatum, commonly known as the yellow fairy brome, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically attaches to the roots of other grasses, such as Agrostis and Poa species, through specialized structures called haustoria. Its life cycle involves producing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that can germinate on suitable host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a minor role in ecosystem dynamics but is of interest in botanical studies of parasitism.</p>
