                <h1>Acmella grandiflora var. discoidea</h1>
<p>Acmella grandiflora var. discoidea, commonly known as the rainbow flower or zigzag plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, multicolored, and often spirally arranged flowers that display a vibrant array of hues. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is known for its unique floral morphology, with petals that form a zigzag pattern. It prefers warm, humid conditions and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella grandiflora var. discoidea has palmate leaves that are broad, lobed, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a red center, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella grandiflora var. discoidea is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and parts of the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>While it was once found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and primarily restricted to fragmented habitats in the wild. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland rainforests. It typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered a species of concern and may be at risk of extinction in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella grandiflora var. discoidea is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and unique, disc-shaped blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or division, with the best results achieved in spring or early summer. The plant has a relatively short growth cycle, blooming within a few months after planting, making it ideal for seasonal gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead or damaged foliage helps maintain its shape. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
