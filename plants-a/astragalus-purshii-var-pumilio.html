                    <h1>Astragalus purshii var. pumilio</h1>
<p>Astragalus purshii var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range.</p>
