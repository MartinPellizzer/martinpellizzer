                    <h1>Avenastrum pubescens var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Avenastrum pubescens var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense tufts with fine, wiry leaves covered in short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
