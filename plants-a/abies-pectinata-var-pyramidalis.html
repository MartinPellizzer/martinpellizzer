<p>Abies pectinata var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal white fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green needles that are shorter than those of the typical white fir. The tree produces cylindrical cones that hang downward, containing winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged texture.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its compact form and evergreen foliage.</p>
