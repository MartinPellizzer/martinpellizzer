                <h1>Adhatoda lupulina</h1>
<p>Adhatoda lupulina, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bell-shaped, typically blue or violet, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Adhatoda lupulina is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various health purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lupulina has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lupulina is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist environments like forests and riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with the Indian subcontinent and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in some parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lupulina was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to suppress weed growth. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can quickly establish itself in open areas. It is native to parts of Asia but has been introduced to several countries for its ecological benefits.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
