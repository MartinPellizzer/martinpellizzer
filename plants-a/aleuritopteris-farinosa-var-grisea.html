                    <h1>Aleuritopteris farinosa var. grisea</h1>
<p>Aleuritopteris farinosa var. grisea, commonly known as the gray fern, is a variant of the common cliff brake.</p>
<p>It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a distinctive grayish-silver coloration on the underside, which gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
