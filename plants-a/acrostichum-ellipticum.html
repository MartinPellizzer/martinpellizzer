                <h1>Acrostichum ellipticum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum ellipticum, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent yellow center. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found near water bodies or in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ellipticum has large, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is thick and woody with a rough, dark brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dark, spherical berry that contains several small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and helps anchor the plant in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ellipticum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in swampy and wetland habitats, particularly in coastal areas and mangrove forests. This plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is often associated with brackish water conditions. It is an important component of the ecological system in these regions, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Australian Archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ellipticum was mainly introduced to disturbed coastal areas and wetlands.</p>
<p>It is often found in regions with high humidity and saline soils. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and tidal zones. Its introduction has led to competition with native vegetation in some areas.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in certain coastal environments.</p>
