                <h1>Actinomeris squarrosa</h1>
<p>Actinomeris squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the water surface. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in adhesion to substrates.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor waters, relying on its prey for essential nutrients.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinomeris squarrosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a white to pale yellow color, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris squarrosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and dense vegetation. This plant thrives in lowland rainforests and is often associated with moist, shaded environments. It is not widely distributed beyond its native range and is rarely encountered outside of these specific habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species in parts of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris squarrosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in areas with poor soil quality. The plant's ability to spread rapidly makes it a potential invasive species in non-native regions. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance, which complicates identification and management efforts.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
