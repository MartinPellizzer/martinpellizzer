                    <h1>Acacia grata</h1>
<p>Acacia grata, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grey-green branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its small, hard pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia grata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.</p>
