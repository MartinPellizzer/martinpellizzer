                    <h1>Astropanax monophyllus</h1>
<p>Astropanax monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaf ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, broad, leathery leaf that emerges directly from the root. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its medicinal properties and limited distribution, it is highly sought after, leading to significant habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare species from extinction.</p>
