<p>Athyrium laxum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, greenish-brown sporangia on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Athyrium laxum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions.</p>
