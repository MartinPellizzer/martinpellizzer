<p>Alectorurus, commonly known as the African silvergrass, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most notably Alectorurus capensis, which is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance. The plants typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Alectorurus species are known for their slender, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>They play a minor role in local ecosystems but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
