                    <h1>Ammodaucus nanocarpus</h1>
<p>Ammodaucus nanocarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Ammodaucus genus. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in dry soils.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range.</p>
