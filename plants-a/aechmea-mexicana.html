                <h1>Aechmea mexicana</h1>
<p>Aechmea mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring bright, indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea mexicana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea mexicana has leaves that are strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette, and can grow up to 30 cm in length, with a waxy, dark green color and a prominent midrib.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, with the base of the leaves forming a dense, compact rosette that protects the central inflorescence. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically in shades of red or orange, and bloom during the summer months, being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight nature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, supporting the plant's growth in its native habitat.</p>
