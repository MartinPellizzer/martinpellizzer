                <h1>Acrotriche baileyana</h1>
<p>Acrotriche baileyana, commonly known as the Bailey's acrotriche, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche baileyana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche baileyana is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in open, sandy soils in coastal and inland areas. It is often associated with disturbed or nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Queensland's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche baileyana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. It has become naturalized in certain regions, spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses no significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
