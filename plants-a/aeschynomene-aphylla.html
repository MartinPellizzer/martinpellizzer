                    <h1>Aeschynomene aphylla</h1>
<p>Aeschynomene aphylla, commonly known as the leafless sicklegrass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with only reduced, scale-like structures along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, and it relies on wind pollination. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Aeschynomene aphylla is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to tolerate heavy metals.</p>
