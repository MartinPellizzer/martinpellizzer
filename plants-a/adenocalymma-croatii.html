<p>Adenocalymma croatii, commonly known as the Croatian adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma croatii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma croatii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a shrub-like manner. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma croatii is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is typically found in open grasslands and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within southern Africa due to its particular environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma croatii was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in garden centers and is popular among horticulturists for its unique appearance.
