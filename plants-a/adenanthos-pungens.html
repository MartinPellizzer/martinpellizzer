                <h1>Adenanthos pungens</h1>
<p>Adenanthos pungens, commonly known as the sharp-leaf adenanthos, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos pungens has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and are typically pink to red in color, blooming from late autumn to winter, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos pungens is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the state, particularly in the south-western area. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenanthos pungens is an important part of the local flora and is often seen in coastal reserves and national parks.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos pungens was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It has since been found growing in various regions, including parts of Victoria and South Australia. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can spread rapidly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and manage its impact on local flora.</p>
