<p>Aspidium acutilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Water Ferns (Polypodiaceae).</p>

The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Aspidium acutilobum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
