                    <h1>Antennaria congesta</h1>
<p>Antennaria congesta, commonly known as the clustered willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant features slender, branching stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Antennaria congesta is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels.</p>
