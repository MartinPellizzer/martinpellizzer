                <h1>Adicea urticella</h1>
<p>Adicea urticella, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause an irritating rash upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Adicea urticella is also known for its edible leaves, which can be cooked and used in various culinary applications.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea urticella has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, and typically have a dark green color with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is herbaceous, with a greenish-yellow color and a slightly hairy texture, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more complex as the plant matures. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters, have five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea urticella is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and disturbed soils. The plant thrives in areas with mild, temperate climates and is often associated with coastal and semi-arid environments. It is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Adicea urticella is a low-growing perennial plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea urticella was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and habitat quality.</p>
