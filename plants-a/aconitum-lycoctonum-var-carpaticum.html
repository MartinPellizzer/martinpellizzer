                    <h1>Aconitum lycoctonum var. carpaticum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum var. carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>
