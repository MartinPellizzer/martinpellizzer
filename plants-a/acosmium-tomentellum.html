                <h1>Acosmium tomentellum</h1>
<p>Acosmium tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly acosmium, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Acosmium tomentellum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium tomentellum has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, while the bark is smooth and light gray. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, with a simple structure that blooms in spring and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium tomentellum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions with moist, temperate climates. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with chaparral and mixed evergreen forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium tomentellum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and forest margins. Its introduction is believed to be due to accidental dispersal through human activities.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential weed that can compete with native vegetation.</p>
