                    <h1>Austrosteenisia blackii var. astipella</h1>
<p>Austrosteenisia blackii var. astipella, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Austrosteenisia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in a thin layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, typical of many succulent species. It produces small, greenish-white flowers during the warmer months, and its growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
