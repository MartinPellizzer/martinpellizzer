                <h1>Achillea crustata</h1>
<p>Achillea crustata, commonly known as stone everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant features upright, branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea crustata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, with a grayish-green color and a woolly texture.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, low-growing pattern. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and bloom from late spring to early summer, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, with seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to scattered areas in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Italy. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes, gravelly soils, and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Achillea crustata is considered endangered in some regions and is protected in several countries.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata is a hardy perennial plant known for its compact growth and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata is a low-growing perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its yellow flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea crustata also plays a role in improving soil structure and moisture retention, further supporting ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata is a flowering plant known for its various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is sometimes used as a herb to add flavor to dishes, although its use is less common compared to other members of the Asteraceae family. Medicinally, it has been traditionally employed for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, though scientific validation of these uses is limited. Industrially, it may contribute to ecological applications by supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Culturally, it has symbolic significance in some regions, often associated with resilience and healing due to its hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata has several popular cultivars such as 'Snowcap' and 'Silver King', which are prized for their dense, silvery foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in rock gardens and as ground covers due to their hardiness and low maintenance requirements. Hybrids of Achillea crustata have been developed to enhance flower color, growth habit, and disease resistance, making them more adaptable to different garden conditions. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in poor soils and its long blooming period, which adds visual interest to the landscape.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea crustata and its varieties are valuable additions to perennial gardens, offering both aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
