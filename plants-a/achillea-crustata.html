                <h1>Achillea crustata</h1>
<p>Achillea crustata, commonly known as the cushion yarrow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of herbal remedies adds to its botanical significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with yellow petals and a green center, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Tibet.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific high-altitude areas in the Himalayas and adjacent regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands. This species typically grows at altitudes between 2,500 and 5,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea crustata is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata is a low-growing perennial plant known for its silver-gray foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea crustata involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant plants like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and appearance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea crustata is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its yellow flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other herbs and flowers to enhance soil health and promote growth. Additionally, its dense growth habit helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea crustata also plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by offering habitat and resources to a variety of organisms.</p>
