                    <h1>Adelaster</h1>
<p>Adelaster, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by spherical, red fruits that split open to release seeds. Adelaster is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
