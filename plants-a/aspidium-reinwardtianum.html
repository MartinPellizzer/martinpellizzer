<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates such as soil or rocks.</p>
