                    <h1>Andicolea leptothamna</h1>
<p>Andicolea leptothamna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved andicolea, is a rare fern native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
