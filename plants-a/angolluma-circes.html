                    <h1>Angolluma circes</h1>
<p>Angolluma circes, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It features hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in spring. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Despite its attractive appearance, it is considered toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
