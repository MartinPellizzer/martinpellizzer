<p>Anthericum chandleri, commonly known as Chandler's lantern, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its spatheous inflorescence, which consists of a showy, petal-like bract surrounding a spadix. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers within the spadix, which are pollinated by specific insect species. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
