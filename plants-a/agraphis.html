                    <h1>Agraphis</h1>
<p>Agraphis, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, yellowish composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Agraphis species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils. They produce seeds in the form of tiny, wind-dispersed pappus structures, aiding in their spread.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
