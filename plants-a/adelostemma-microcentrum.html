                <h1>Adelostemma microcentrum</h1>
<p>Adelostemma microcentrum, commonly known as the small-centred devil's-bit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to South Africa, characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelostemma microcentrum has small, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green to pale brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a pale yellow color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelostemma microcentrum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the regions of the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops, sandstone formations, and dry, sunny areas. It is often associated with fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the Cape Floristic Region.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited, and it is considered a rare and localized species within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelostemma microcentrum was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste places due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. The plant spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its wide distribution. Its introduction has led to it becoming an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include manual removal and the use of herbicides in affected regions.</p>
