<p>Atriplex patula subsp.</p>
<p>microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its seeds are minute, contributing to its ability to disperse over long distances. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
