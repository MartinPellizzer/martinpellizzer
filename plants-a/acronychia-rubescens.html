                <h1>Acronychia rubescens</h1>
<p>Acronychia rubescens, commonly known as the red-fruited acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in coastal and subtropical regions, often found in coastal heathlands and rainforests.</p>
<p>Acronychia rubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia rubescens has simple, elliptic or ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a woody texture, and grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and five sepals, blooming in spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its coastal habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia rubescens is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. This species thrives in lowland and montane forest ecosystems. It is commonly observed in the northern and eastern regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia rubescens was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value, featuring attractive, leathery leaves and showy red flowers. It has been introduced to several Pacific islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines, as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
