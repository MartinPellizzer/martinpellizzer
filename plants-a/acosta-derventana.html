                <h1>Acosta derventana</h1>
<p>Acosta derventana, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water in hot, dry environments. Acosta derventana typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>It produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta derventana has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, typically ranging from 2-5 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly woody texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring; they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta derventana is primarily native to the high Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes or in shaded understories. It is an important component of the local flora and has adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta derventana was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in regions with mild winters and hot summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where sunlight is abundant and moisture levels are moderate. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as those near roadsides or in cultivated fields. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>However, its spread has been limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
