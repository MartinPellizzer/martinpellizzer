                    <h1>Asplenium pinnatifidum f. elongatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium pinnatifidum f. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often elongated compared to the typical form of A. pinnatifidum. The fronds are usually dark green and have a delicate, grass-like appearance, with a distinct midrib and small, tooth-like lobes along the edges. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively uncommon variant within the Asplenium genus.</p>
