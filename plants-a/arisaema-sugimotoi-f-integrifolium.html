                    <h1>Arisaema sugimotoi f. integrifolium</h1>
<p>Arisaema sugimotoi f. integrifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with smooth margins.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically green with a yellowish tint. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
