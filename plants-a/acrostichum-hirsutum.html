                <h1>Acrostichum hirsutum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it the common name "hairy brake fern.".</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hirsutum has large, triangular, and pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a creeping or climbing manner. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, especially in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hirsutum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, including parts of Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and riverbanks. It is also present in the Caribbean islands, where it grows in similar moist habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into some parts of the southern United States, including Florida and Texas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hirsutum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in coastal areas and wetlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils along riverbanks and marshes. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture for its large, feathery fronds.</p>
