                    <h1>Astragalus xerophilus</h1>
<p>Astragalus xerophilus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Astragalus xerophilus plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
