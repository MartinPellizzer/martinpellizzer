                            <h1>Acronia Omoglossa</h1>
<p>Common sunflower, scientifically known as Acronia omoglossa, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow flower heads that follow the sun throughout the day, a trait known as heliotropism. This resilient species thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping. Despite its beauty, it plays an important ecological role by providing food for pollinators and supporting local wildlife.</p>
