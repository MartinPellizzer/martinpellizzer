                    <h1>Austrodanthonia alpicola</h1>
<p>Austrodanthonia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine wallaby grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Austrodanthonia alpicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
