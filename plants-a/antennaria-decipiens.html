                    <h1>Antennaria decipiens</h1>
<p>Antennaria decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features dense, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for the similar-looking but non-native mouse-ear (Antennaria dioica). It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are typically pale yellow to white, adding a subtle floral presence to its natural environment.</p>
