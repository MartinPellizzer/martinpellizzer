                <h1>Acinos vulgaris var. villosus</h1>
<p>Acinos vulgaris var. villosus, commonly known as the woolly acino, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos vulgaris var. villosus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy texture and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, with five petals, and bloom in early summer, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos vulgaris var. villosus is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, France, Italy, and Switzerland, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. This plant typically grows in open, sunny environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos vulgaris var. villosus is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sunny to partially shaded areas.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstock in early spring. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2-3 years, and produces small yellow flowers in late spring.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering maintains its compact form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter harmful pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos vulgaris var. villosus is a low-growing perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, yellow flowers, contributing to ecosystem pollination. The plant acts as a companion plant in alpine and rocky habitats, enhancing biodiversity in these environments. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and supporting microbial activity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos vulgaris var. villosus is a low-growing plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, known for its soft, woolly leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically gathered for ornamental purposes in gardens and alpine landscapes. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat respiratory ailments and as a mild sedative due to its essential oils. Its presence in alpine ecosystems contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and endurance, often appearing in local folklore and botanical art.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos vulgaris var. villosus has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Albus' and 'Roseum', which showcase striking white and pink flowers respectively.</p>
<p>While specific hybrids of this variety are not widely documented, it is occasionally crossbred with other Acinos species to enhance floral characteristics and hardiness. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils, making it a valuable addition to alpine gardens and rockeries. The plant's unique appearance and low maintenance requirements contribute to its popularity among gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscape design to add texture and color to challenging growing conditions.</p>
