                    <h1>Atriplex veneta</h1>
<p>Atriplex veneta, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which reduces water loss and enhances drought resistance.</p>
<p>Atriplex veneta plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
