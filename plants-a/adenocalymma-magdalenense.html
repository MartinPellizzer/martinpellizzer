                <h1>Adenocalymma magdalenense</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma magdalenense, commonly known as the Magdalena burr, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma magdalenense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry soil conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma magdalenense is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern part of the country, specifically in the Magdalena River basin. This plant typically grows in tropical wet and dry climates. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found in open areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Colombia due to its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma magdalenense was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Esp√≠rito Santo and Rio de Janeiro, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and research institutions for its unique morphology and ecological significance. Its introduction has contributed to the study of native flora and the promotion of biodiversity in the region.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely naturalized in the wild and remains primarily a cultivated species.</p>
