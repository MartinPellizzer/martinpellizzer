                <h1>Acmella fimbriata</h1>
<p>Acmella fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed pincushion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, and colorful inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers range in color from yellow to orange.</p>
<p>Acmella fimbriata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella fimbriata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 2â€“5 cm in length and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, yellow with red markings, and have a distinctive crown-like structure, blooming from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella fimbriata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshy areas, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, organic soil. It is often associated with swampy habitats and is part of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of the Amazon Basin and other regions with high rainfall and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella fimbriata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and medicinal properties in certain regions.</p>
