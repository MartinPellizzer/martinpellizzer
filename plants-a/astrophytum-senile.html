<p>Astrophytum senile, commonly known as the old man cactus, is a unique species native to the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in short, white spines and clusters of small, pink or red flowers. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its wrinkled, almost puffy texture, which helps it store water and withstand arid conditions. It produces a single, tall flowering stalk each year, typically in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Astrophytum senile is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
