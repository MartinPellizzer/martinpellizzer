                <h1>Achillea × schreineri</h1>
<p>Achillea × schreineri, commonly known as the Schreiner's yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, clustered flower heads that range in color from white to pale pink. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × schreineri has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a bluish-gray hue, arranged in a rosette pattern and typically reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered with fine hairs, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are compound umbels with small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × schreineri is a hybrid plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas where its parent species, Achillea millefolium and Achillea lanulosa, naturally occur. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its natural occurrence and limited cultivation, it is not currently listed as endangered, though its hybrid nature may affect its conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × schreineri is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in spring or by seeds sown in early fall. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its form and vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
