                <h1>Actinodaphne sessilifructa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne sessilifructa, commonly known as the sessile-fruited camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces oval, woody fruits that contain a single seed, and its bark exudes a fragrant, resinous substance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal and aromatic properties, it has been traditionally used in various herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sessilifructa has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbroken throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing primarily through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and stabilizing the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sessilifructa is primarily native to the islands of the western Pacific, including parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its distribution is largely restricted to Southeast Asia and the surrounding islands.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these regions as part of the forest understory vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sessilifructa was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its distribution has been expanded through horticultural trade and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
