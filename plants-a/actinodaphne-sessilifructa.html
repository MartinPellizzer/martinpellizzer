                <h1>Actinodaphne sessilifructa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne sessilifructa, commonly known as the sessile-fruited camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by oval, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne sessilifructa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sessilifructa has elliptical, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a leathery texture and a moderate size, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, ovoid berry that turns red when mature, and it is dispersed primarily by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sessilifructa is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region, primarily found in the Philippines, Indonesia, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While its native range is largely restricted to these areas, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections worldwide. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland to hill forests, typically at altitudes between 200 and 1,200 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered vulnerable, though it is not yet classified as endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat and ensure its survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sessilifructa is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, prized for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings often yielding better results due to their higher survival rate. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with significant development occurring over several years, especially under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by scale insects or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lemongrass or citronella can help deter pests and enhance the plant's growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
