                        <h1>Acacia genistifolia subsp. genistifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia genistifolia subsp.</p>
<p>genistifolia, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowers in spring, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia genistifolia subsp.</p>
<p>genistifolia belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, including horsetails and some modern ferns.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important families such as the Rosids and Monocots. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that include legumes, vetches, and other plants known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, which is characterized by pod fruits and often symbiotic nitrogen-fixing relationships with bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive acicular (needle-like) leaves and often for their ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia genistifolia, a specific type of acacia that is characterized by its small, leaf-like stipules and its native habitat in certain regions of Africa.</p>
