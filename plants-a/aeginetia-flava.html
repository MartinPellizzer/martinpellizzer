                <h1>Aeginetia flava</h1>
<p>Aeginetia flava, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are usually small and succulent. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>The yellow sandmat is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia flava has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, with four petals, and bloom in late summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>
