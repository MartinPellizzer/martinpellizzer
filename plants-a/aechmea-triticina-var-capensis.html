                    <h1>Aechmea triticina var. capensis</h1>
<p>Aechmea triticina var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape wheatgrass bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of white trichomes. The plant produces vibrant red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
