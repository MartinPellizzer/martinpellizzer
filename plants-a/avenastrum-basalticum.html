                    <h1>Avenastrum basalticum</h1>
<p>Avenastrum basalticum, commonly known as basalt grass, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its growth is often associated with areas of recent volcanic activity due to its preference for nutrient-rich, mineral-laden substrates.</p>
<p>Avenastrum basalticum plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for small insects and animals.</p>
