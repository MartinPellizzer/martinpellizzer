                <h1>Adiantum aneitense</h1>
<p>Adiantum aneitense, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Adiantum aneitense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegance and air-purifying properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum aneitense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern, and ranging in size from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a slightly glossy surface and a serrated or finely toothed margin. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with no distinct petals, and relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing structure, and the plant disperses its spores via wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum aneitense is primarily native to Maluku, New Guinea, Solomon Is., and Vanuatu.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in humid, tropical environments within these regions. It thrives in shaded, moist areas such as forests and rocky habitats. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these island nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum aneitense was mainly introduced to the Azores.</p>
<p>It is a fern species that has been documented in this region, likely due to its ornamental value or accidental introduction through human activity. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along streams. Its presence in the Azores may indicate a non-native distribution, possibly due to introduction from its native range in South America.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact in the Azores is not well studied.</p>
