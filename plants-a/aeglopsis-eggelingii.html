                <h1>Aeglopsis eggelingii</h1>
<p>Aeglopsis eggelingii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Aeglopsis eggelingii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeglopsis eggelingii has leaves that are simple, ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched until the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
