                <h1>Acinodendron lanatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron lanatum, commonly known as the woolly acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lanatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern with branching occurring from the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lanatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly found in secondary growth areas. This plant is often associated with moist, well-drained soils and is part of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>
<p>Acinodendron lanatum plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lanatum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it a popular choice for land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some regions where it may outcompete native vegetation.</p>
