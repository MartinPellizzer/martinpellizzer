<p>Anacampseros thevensei, commonly known as the Cape Town ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
