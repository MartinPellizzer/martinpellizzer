                        <h1>Acacia seifriziana</h1>
<p>Acacia seifriziana, commonly known as the Cape York acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow globular flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the wet season. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Acacia seifriziana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
