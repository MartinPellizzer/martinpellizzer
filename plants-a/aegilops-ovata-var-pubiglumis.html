                    <h1>Aegilops ovata var. pubiglumis</h1>
<p>Aegilops ovata var. pubiglumis, commonly known as the pubescent spikelet wheat, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence with small, pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy glumes, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
