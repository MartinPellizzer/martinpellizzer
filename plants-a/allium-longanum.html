<p>Allium longanum, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its bulbs, which are the primary edible part, are often used in cooking for their mild, onion-like flavor.</p>
<p>Allium longanum is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight.</p>
