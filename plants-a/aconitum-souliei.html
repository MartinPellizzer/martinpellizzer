<p>Aconitum souliei, commonly known as the Suli√© aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts contain potent alkaloids.</p>
