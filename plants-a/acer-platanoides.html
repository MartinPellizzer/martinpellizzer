                        <h1>Acer platanoides</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides, commonly known as the Norway maple, is a deciduous tree native to central and northern Europe.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in urban environments due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species.</p>
