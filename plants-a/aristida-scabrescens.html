<p>Aristida scabrescens, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves with a rough, scabrous texture, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish or purplish hues.</p>
<p>This grass is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
