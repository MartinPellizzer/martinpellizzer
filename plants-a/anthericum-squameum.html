<p>Anthericum squameum, commonly known as the scaly lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a distinctive scaly texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Anthericum squameum is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats.</p>
