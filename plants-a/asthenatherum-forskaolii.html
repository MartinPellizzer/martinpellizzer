                    <h1>Asthenatherum forskaolii</h1>
<p>Asthenatherum forskaolii, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Asthenatherum forskaolii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
