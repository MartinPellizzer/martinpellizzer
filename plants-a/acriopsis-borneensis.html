                <h1>Acriopsis borneensis</h1>
<p>Acriopsis borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean acris, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Acriopsis borneensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in the region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis borneensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with yellow petals and a distinctive central spadix, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis borneensis is primarily native to the islands of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments within lowland and hill forest areas. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and secondary growth.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the Southeast Asian region, particularly within the Bornean archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis borneensis was mainly introduced to Southeast Asian countries, particularly Borneo, due to its unique ecological adaptations and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and green spaces for its striking foliage and potential medicinal properties. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora and ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant requires specific soil and climate conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains limited to areas where these conditions are met, making it a rare but notable species in the region.</p>
