                <h1>Achras zapota var. sphaerica</h1>
<p>Achras zapota var. sphaerica, commonly known as the chupa chups tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree is notable for its distinctive spherical fruits, which are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These fruits are edible, with a sweet, juicy pulp surrounding a central cavity containing seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its fruit, which is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. sphaerica has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30-50 cm in diameter, with a deep green color and a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spherical, spiny capsule that splits open to release numerous small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. sphaerica is a tropical plant native to Central America, particularly Mexico and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical regions across the Americas, including parts of Brazil and the Caribbean islands. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland tropical forests and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 600 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is under threat due to deforestation and land-use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. sphaerica is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and unique spherical fruits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by stem cuttings, with the latter method offering faster results. The plant grows best in warm climates with a long growing season, typically producing fruit within two to three years.</p>
<p>It requires well-drained soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage fruiting are essential. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though aphids and scale insects may occasionally infest it.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests naturally.</p>
