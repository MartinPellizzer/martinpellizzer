                <h1>Adesmia berteroniana</h1>
<p>Adesmia berteroniana, commonly known as the red bignay, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Adesmia berteroniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia berteroniana has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is usually slender and upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small and clustered, featuring a delicate white or pale pink color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, bean-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia berteroniana is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas, and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including desert scrub and rocky soils. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic and climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia berteroniana was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive pink flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in disturbed areas. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, spreading rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
