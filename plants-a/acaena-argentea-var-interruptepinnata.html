                        <h1>Acaena argentea var. interruptepinnata</h1>
<p>Acaena argentea var. interruptepinnata, commonly known as the silverweed with interrupted pinnate leaves, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray leaves that are deeply divided into a pinnate pattern, though the leaflets are interrupted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its leaves and fruits are sometimes used in traditional Māori medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
