                <h1>Achoriphragma beketovii</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma beketovii, commonly known as the Khabarovsk bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It has hairy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma beketovii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma beketovii is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, specifically Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in steppe and desert environments. This plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma beketovii was mainly introduced to new habitats in Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It was likely spread through human activities such as agricultural expansion and transportation of contaminated soil or plant material. This plant has adapted well to the dry and semi-arid environments of these regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive and compete with native flora.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced species in the area.</p>
