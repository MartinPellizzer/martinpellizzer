                    <h1>Arundo capillata</h1>
<p>Arundo capillata, commonly known as the silky reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine, silky texture that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and riverbanks. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are often clustered at the top of the stalk.</p>
<p>Arundo capillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in basket weaving and as a source of thatching.</p>
