                <h1>Adenosacme coriacea</h1>
<p>Adenosacme coriacea, commonly known as the rough adenosacme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, thickened leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its stem is covered in a rough, waxy texture, which provides additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Adenosacme coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme coriacea has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough, waxy texture and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a thick, grayish-brown bark that is furrowed and ridged, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme coriacea is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in coastal areas and mountainous terrains. The plant is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It is commonly seen in countries such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme coriacea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and sufficient sunlight. This plant is commonly found in disturbed environments such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
