                <h1>Acinodendron pyrifolium</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pyrifolium, commonly known as the pineapple tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that resemble small pineapples, hence its common name. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acinodendron pyrifolium is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its fruit, which is rich in nutrients.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pyrifolium has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pyrifolium is primarily native to tropical Africa, specifically countries such as Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, lowland forest areas and is commonly found in the understory of dense tropical rainforests. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often associated with humid, shaded environments. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pyrifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It has been observed growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its spread. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
