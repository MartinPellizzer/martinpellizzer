<p>Antiphylla spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf antiphylla, is a perennial herb native to South America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and spatulate in shape, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its root system is tuberous, allowing it to store nutrients and survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Antiphylla spathulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
