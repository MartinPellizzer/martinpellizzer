                <h1>Adenostephanus obversiflorus</h1>
<p>Adenostephanus obversiflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stephanus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense, spherical heads.</p>
<p>Adenostephanus obversiflorus is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is known for its high biodiversity and unique ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus obversiflorus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that exudes a mild fragrance when crushed. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus obversiflorus is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as California, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora and Chihuahua. This plant typically grows in chaparral and scrub habitats. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with Mediterranean climates characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus obversiflorus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in southern California and parts of Baja California. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species that may pose a threat to local biodiversity.</p>
