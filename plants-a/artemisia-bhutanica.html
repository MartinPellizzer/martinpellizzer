<p>Artemisia bhutanica, commonly known as Bhutan wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan region, particularly Bhutan and northern India.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded areas at high altitudes, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant has aromatic, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in narrow, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Artemisia bhutanica is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
