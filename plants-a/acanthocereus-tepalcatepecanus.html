                <h1>Acanthocereus tepalcatepecanus</h1>
<p>Acanthocereus tepalcatepecanus, commonly known as the Tepalcatepec cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tepalcatepecanus has a cylindrical, branching stem that is typically covered with a rough, bark-like texture and a pale green to grayish color.</p>
<p>It is a spineless cactus, so it does not have true leaves, but it does have areoles that may bear small, ephemeral bristles. The flowers are large, funnel-shaped, and typically yellow or orange in color, blooming at night during the summer months and pollinated by moths. The fruit is a fleshy, red or orange berry that contains numerous small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb water quickly from infrequent rains.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tepalcatepecanus is a cactus native to the highlands of central Mexico, specifically the Sierra Madre Occidental region.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the state of Jalisco. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops and limestone soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tepalcatepecanus is a slow-growing cactus native to Mexico, prized for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for faster results. This species follows a typical cactus growth cycle, with active growth during the warmer months and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Fertilization should be limited to a low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer during the growing season, while pruning is minimal but can help shape the plant. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tepalcatepecanus is a cactus species that provides food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bats and insects with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in arid ecosystems, supporting biodiversity. It also helps with erosion control due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by offering a habitat and food source in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tepalcatepecanus is a cactus species native to Mexico, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may be occasionally foraged for its edible fruits in certain regions. In traditional medicine, the plant has been used by indigenous communities for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptation, often featured in regional art and botanical studies.</p>
