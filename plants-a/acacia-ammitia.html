<p>Acacia ammitia, commonly known as the Egyptian acacia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Its thorny stems provide protection against herbivores, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acacia ammitia is also valued for its gum, which has been used historically in various traditional applications.</p>
