<p>Agalma lutchuense, commonly known as the Lutchu Island orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Lutchu Islands in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Agalma lutchuense is considered endangered and is protected under local conservation laws.</p>
