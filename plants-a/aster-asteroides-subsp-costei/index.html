                            <h1>Aster Asteroides Subsp. Costei</h1>
<p>Blueweed, scientifically known as Aster asteroides subsp. costei, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in prairie and grassland habitats. The plant is characterized by its small blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Despite its name, it is not particularly showy and often goes unnoticed in the wild. Blueweed plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment.</p>
