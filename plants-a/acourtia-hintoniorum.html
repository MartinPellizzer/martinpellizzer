                <h1>Acourtia hintoniorum</h1>
<p>Acourtia hintoniorum, commonly known as Hinton's acourtia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia hintoniorum has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia hintoniorum is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, and parts of Coahuila. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. The plant is adapted to the dry climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of this region.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia hintoniorum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, gravel bars, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soils. This species is often found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including road construction and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in these disturbed environments.</p>
