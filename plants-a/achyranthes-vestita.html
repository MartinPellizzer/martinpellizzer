                <h1>Achyranthes vestita</h1>
<p>Achyranthes vestita, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with latex-producing characteristics. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The small yellow flowers are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes vestita has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes vestita is primarily native to southern and eastern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open habitats. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to tropical and subtropical areas within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes vestita was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. This plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its success in new areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat in all regions where it is introduced.</p>
