                    <h1>Agropyron unilaterale</h1>
<p>Agropyron unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron unilaterale is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its low-growing form and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
