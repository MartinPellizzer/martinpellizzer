                <h1>Acratherum miliaceum</h1>
<p>Acratherum miliaceum, commonly known as the millet grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>Acratherum miliaceum is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acratherum miliaceum has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acratherum miliaceum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and desert environments. It is commonly associated with areas having well-drained soils and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acratherum miliaceum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily brought in for its ornamental value due to its distinctive seed pods. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in this region. It has become naturalized in several areas, though it is not considered invasive.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where it can thrive.</p>
