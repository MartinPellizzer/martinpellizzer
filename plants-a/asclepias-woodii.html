                    <h1>Asclepias woodii</h1>
<p>Asclepias woodii, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces intricate, horn-shaped seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds attached to silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias woodii is a vital host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly, playing a crucial role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now extremely rare and protected in many regions.</p>
