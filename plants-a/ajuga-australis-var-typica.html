                    <h1>Ajuga australis var. typica</h1>
<p>Ajuga australis var. typica, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming extensive carpets in suitable habitats.</p>
