                <h1>Adesmia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Adesmia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly legume, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, soft, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pods containing several seeds. Adesmia tomentosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and has potential for ecological restoration due to its hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia tomentosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a fine, woolly pubescence, and has a light green to pale brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia tomentosa is primarily native to Chile Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the central regions of Chile, including the Valpara√≠so and Coquimbo regions. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of the area. It is commonly seen in coastal and inland desert environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Chile Central.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia tomentosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has also been introduced as an ornamental species in some tropical and subtropical areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
