                    <h1>Agrostis vivipara</h1>
<p>Agrostis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on moist, often acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted shoots and small, spike-like inflorescences. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This unique reproductive strategy allows it to colonize disturbed or wetland habitats efficiently.</p>
