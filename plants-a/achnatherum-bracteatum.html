                <h1>Achnatherum bracteatum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters.</p>
<p>Achnatherum bracteatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum bracteatum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and typically arranged in two rows along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, upright, and has a smooth, light green to grayish-brown color, growing in dense clumps. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brownish florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum bracteatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as China, Mongolia, and Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations. This grass species is well adapted to cold climates and is often part of the vegetation in mountain meadows and steppes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is closely tied to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum bracteatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate precipitation. This plant is often spread through human activity, including transportation and land development. It has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can sometimes become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
