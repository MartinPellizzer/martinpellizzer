<p>Andropogon familiaris, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for prairie ecosystems. Switchgrass is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes many other grasses.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion and supports biodiversity in grassland habitats.</p>
