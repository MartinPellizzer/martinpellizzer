                <h1>Actinodaphne myriantha</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne myriantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and fragrant, aromatic bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its essential oils are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne myriantha has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is typically straight and cylindrical, with smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth, yellowish drupe that disperses via wind and animals after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne myriantha is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing along riverbanks and in shaded undergrowth. It is commonly found in the western and eastern parts of Borneo, including areas in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is valued for its aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne myriantha was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and as an ornamental plant. This species is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
