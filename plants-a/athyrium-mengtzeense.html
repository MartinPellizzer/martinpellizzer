                    <h1>Athyrium mengtzeense</h1>
<p>Athyrium mengtzeense, commonly known as the Mengtze fern, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine layer of brownish moss, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
