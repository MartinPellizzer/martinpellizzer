<p>Anomalanthus scoparius, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that forms dense mats of foliage, often covering the ground in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Anomalanthus scoparius is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
