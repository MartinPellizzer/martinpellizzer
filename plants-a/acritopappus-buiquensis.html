                <h1>Acritopappus buiquensis</h1>
<p>Acritopappus buiquensis, commonly known as the Biqui goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the family. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Acritopappus buiquensis is known for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it a valuable species for ecological studies in semi-desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus buiquensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing in a spreading pattern with a low, creeping habit. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring tubular petals and stamens, and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are finely dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus buiquensis is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the state of Pernambuco. It thrives in the tropical and subtropical climates of this area. The plant is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic region within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus buiquensis was mainly introduced to areas with specific ecological conditions that support its growth, such as well-drained soils and moderate moisture levels.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, open fields, and along riverbanks. The plant's distribution is limited to regions with a temperate climate and sufficient sunlight exposure. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has shown potential for further spread into new environments.</p>
