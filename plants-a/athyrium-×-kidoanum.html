                    <h1>Athyrium × kidoanum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × kidoanum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a hybrid fern that combines traits from its parent species, Athyrium nipponicum and Athyrium filix-femina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that display a striking gradient of green to silvery-white on the underside. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and prefers shady, moist environments with well-draining soil. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, especially in shaded garden beds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, round sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
