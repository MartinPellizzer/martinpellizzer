<p>Acinodendron neriifolium, commonly known as the black-leaved acinodendron, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are oval in shape and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany.</p>
