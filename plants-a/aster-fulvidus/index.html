                            <h1>Aster Fulvidus</h1>
<p>Fulvous aster, scientifically known as Aster fulvidus, is a striking flowering plant native to the eastern United States. This species is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often forming dense clusters along the edges of water bodies. The plant's common name reflects its vivid coloration, which stands out against the surrounding vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native gardens and restoration projects.</p>
