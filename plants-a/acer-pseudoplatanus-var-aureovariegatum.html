<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-variegated leaves that add vibrant color to gardens and natural landscapes. The plant is native to parts of Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It typically grows as a medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and horticultural displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. aureovariegatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, displaying a striking variegated pattern of yellow and green.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a rounded crown.

The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses via wind, allowing the seeds to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. aureovariegatum is a variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Italy and parts of Spain.</p>
<p>While it originally thrived in these areas, it is now widely cultivated and distributed across temperate regions worldwide, including gardens and urban landscapes. This variety prefers cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in forested areas or along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered in its native habitat, its conservation status is generally stable due to its popularity as an ornamental plant.</p>
