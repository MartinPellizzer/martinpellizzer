                <h1>Adenocline procumbens</h1>
<p>Adenocline procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate adenocline, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features sprawling stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which are accompanied by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, with succulent leaves that help store water.</p>
<p>Adenocline procumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocline procumbens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a slightly hairy texture and a pale green color, growing close to the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline procumbens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and wetlands. This plant is commonly associated with humid environments and is often seen growing near water sources. It is also present in parts of northeastern India and the islands of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can occasionally be found in disturbed habitats and along the edges of forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline procumbens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is known for its spreading growth habit, which allows it to colonize new areas quickly. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
