                <h1>Adiantum pumilum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pumilum, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically less than a foot in length, with a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>Adiantum pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pumilum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly curled margin. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing fern, and it does not have fruits or seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pumilum is primarily native to Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the island's moist, shaded forest understories. This fern thrives in humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along stream banks and in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to the Caribbean region, with Jamaica being a key habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pumilum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight and maintain high humidity. This plant is often found in regions with rich, organic soil and consistent moisture levels. Its introduction has been noted in several states, including Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species in these areas, often establishing itself in disturbed or wetland habitats.</p>
