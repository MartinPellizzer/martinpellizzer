                <h1>Actaea nigra</h1>
<p>Actaea nigra, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, unbranched stems that bear opposite, compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional and modern herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Actaea nigra thrives in shady, moist woodland environments and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea nigra has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a finely toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright and branching near the base. It produces white to pale green flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, with five petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like drupe containing several seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it spread vegetatively through underground stems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea nigra is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rich, loamy soils. Its distribution spans from southern Ontario to northern Florida and westward to Minnesota.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea nigra was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by animals and wind. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its impact varies depending on local environmental conditions and competition with native species.</p>
