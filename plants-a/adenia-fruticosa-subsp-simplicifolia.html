                <h1>Adenia fruticosa subsp. simplicifolia</h1>
<p>Adenia fruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved adenia, is a shrub native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces orange to yellow berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia fruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>simplicifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length. The stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to reddish-brown in color, and they grow in a shrub-like form with multiple branches.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia fruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>simplicifolia is a rare and endemic species native to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Ituri and Bas-Uele provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded understorey environments within lowland rainforests. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenia fruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>simplicifolia is a vigorous, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its attractive foliage and medicinal properties. It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and promote bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
