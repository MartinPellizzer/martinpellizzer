                <h1>Acriopsis sumatrana</h1>
<p>Acriopsis sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran acridopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid tropical climate. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acriopsis sumatrana is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis sumatrana has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 10â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green in color, with a woody texture and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis sumatrana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is found in the islands of Sumatra and Java, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is commonly associated with rainforests and is often found in undergrowth areas. It has a limited geographic range and is not widely distributed beyond its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis sumatrana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate, characterized by high temperatures and seasonal rainfall. The plant's introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and transportation corridors. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding as a result of both natural dispersal and human-mediated spread.</p>
