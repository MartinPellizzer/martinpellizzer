                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. sanguineum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. sanguineum, commonly known as the red-leaf maple, is a striking ornamental variation of the common maple.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which turns deep crimson in autumn, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a moderate size, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are palmately lobed, similar to the parent species, but with a distinctive reddish hue throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, exhibiting good adaptability to temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. sanguineum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. sanguineum is a variant of the maple tree originally native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>While it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, its current distribution includes gardens and parks in temperate regions such as the United Kingdom, North America, and parts of Asia. This form thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in forested areas or along stream banks. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not listed as endangered, its conservation status remains uncertain due to its limited natural occurrence and reliance on human cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. sanguineum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant red foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in early summer or by grafting onto a compatible rootstock. This variety exhibits a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. sanguineum is a variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its showy red flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem pollination. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting biodiversity in local habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. sanguineum is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant red leaves, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While not typically used in culinary applications, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and public spaces. In medicinal contexts, it has limited use, though its leaves may be studied for potential phytochemical properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and woodworking sectors when grown for its durable wood.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes seasonal change and is often used in art and literature to represent autumn's beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
