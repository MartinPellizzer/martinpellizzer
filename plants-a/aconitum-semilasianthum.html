                <h1>Aconitum semilasianthum</h1>
<p>Aconitum semilasianthum, commonly known as the Himalayan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant produces palmate leaves with a deeply divided structure, typical of many members of its genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum semilasianthum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with serrated edges and a moderate size, typically reaching up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a bluish-green bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred shape, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The plant produces follicles as its fruit, containing small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
