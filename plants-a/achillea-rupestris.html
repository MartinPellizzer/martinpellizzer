                <h1>Achillea rupestris</h1>
<p>Achillea rupestris, commonly known as the rock yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements.</p>
<p>Achillea rupestris is also valued for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat wounds and inflammation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea rupestris has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, grayish bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads with ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rupestris is primarily native to Italy.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the central and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils along slopes and in open habitats. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
<p>Its native range in Italy reflects its preference for sunny and well-drained environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rupestris was mainly introduced to stabilize slopes and prevent erosion in disturbed or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also favored for its ornamental value, with its pale yellow flowers adding visual interest to landscapes. It has been successfully established in various regions with suitable climates, particularly in dry and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-target areas.</p>
