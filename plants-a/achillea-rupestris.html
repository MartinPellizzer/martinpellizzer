                <h1>Achillea rupestris</h1>
<p>Achillea rupestris, commonly known as rock yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pale pink, resembling those of other members of the Asteraceae family. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Achillea rupestris is drought-tolerant and low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea rupestris has leaves that are gray-green in color, lance-shaped, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a rough, hairy texture and a diameter of up to 5 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in fine hairs, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and form dense, flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky or dry soils, helping the plant anchor itself in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rupestris is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. This species prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in cliffs, slopes, and gravelly habitats. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea rupestris is listed as a species of conservation concern in some regions due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea rupestris is a hardy perennial that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, making it ideal for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots in early spring, ensuring quick establishment. The plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer with flat, yellowish flower heads that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>It requires minimal watering once established, with well-draining soil to prevent root rot, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring. Pruning spent flowers encourages continuous blooming, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with sedum or thyme enhances its ornamental value and improves soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea rupestris is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both food and shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in dry, rocky soils, helping to stabilize the environment and prevent erosion. Its deep root system also aids in improving soil structure and water retention.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by creating microhabitats for small invertebrates and supporting the broader ecological network.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea rupestris is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use, though some parts of the plant may be used in traditional recipes in certain regions. Medicinally, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, though its applications are not as well-documented as other members of the Asteraceae family. Industrially, it is primarily valued for horticultural purposes, contributing to the floral industry and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though its symbolic role is less prominent compared to other plants like yarrow.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea rupestris has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea', known for its bright yellow foliage, and 'Purpurea', which features striking purple leaves.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids that combine traits from other species of yarrow, enhancing flower color and foliage variation. These varieties are valued for their ornamental appeal and hardiness. They are commonly used in rock gardens and as border plants due to their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea rupestris holds significant horticultural importance for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, visually striking plants.</p>
