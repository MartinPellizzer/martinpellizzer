                    <h1>Acacia senegal var. verek</h1>
<p>Acacia senegal var. verek, commonly known as the gum arabic acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the production of a valuable gum, known as gum arabic, which is harvested from the exudation of its bark.</p>
<p>This gum is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries due to its emulsifying and stabilizing properties.</p>
