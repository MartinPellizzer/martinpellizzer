                        <h1>Acacia senegal var. verek</h1>
<p>Acacia senegal var. verek, commonly known as the gum arabic acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the production of a valuable gum, known as gum arabic, which is harvested from the exudation of its bark.</p>
<p>This gum is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries due to its emulsifying and stabilizing properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal var. verek is primarily native to the Sahel region of Africa, including countries such as Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Senegal.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and along riverbanks. This variety is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a valuable resource for local communities. It is commonly used for gum production, traditional medicine, and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones where it can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal var. verek was mainly introduced to areas with semi-arid to arid climates, particularly in regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas. This plant is valued for its gum production, which is used in various industries including pharmaceuticals and food. It has been introduced to new regions to support local economies and for environmental rehabilitation efforts.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has also raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
