<p>Adenia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered adenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, which are borne on the stems.</p>
<p>Adenia parviflora is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and unique floral structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia parviflora has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels off in thin strips. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels, and bloom during the wet season; they are pollinated by insects.
