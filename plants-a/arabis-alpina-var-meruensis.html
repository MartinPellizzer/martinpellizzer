                    <h1>Arabis alpina var. meruensis</h1>
<p>Arabis alpina var. meruensis, commonly known as the Meru rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh alpine environments and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
