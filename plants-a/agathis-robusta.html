                    <h1>Agathis robusta</h1>
<p>Agathis robusta, commonly known as the giant's pine or woolly mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of over 50 meters. The tree has a straight trunk with a thick, flaky bark that provides some resistance to pests and diseases. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its large, cone-like fruits that contain seeds enclosed in woody capsules.</p>
