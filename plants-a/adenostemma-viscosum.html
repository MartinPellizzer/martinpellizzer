                    <h1>Adenostemma viscosum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma viscosum, commonly known as sticky bluemink, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Adenostemma viscosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>
