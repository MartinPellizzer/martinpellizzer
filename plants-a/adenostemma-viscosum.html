                <h1>Adenostemma viscosum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma viscosum, commonly known as sticky bluemink, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Adenostemma viscosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma viscosum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a medium size and a dull green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a sticky, glandular surface, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma viscosum is primarily native to the Andaman Is., Assam, Benin, Burkina, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Provinces, Caroline Is., Central African Republic, China South-Central, China Southeast, Comoros, Congo, DR Congo, East Himalaya, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gulf of Guinea Is., Hainan, Hawaii, Ivory Coast, Japan, Jawa, Kazan-retto, Korea, KwaZulu-Natal, Laos, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaya, Maldives, Mali, Marquesas, Mauritius, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nansei-shoto, New South Wales, Nicobar Is., Nigeria, Niue, Northern Provinces, Pakistan, Philippines, Queensland, Samoa, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Society Is., South China Sea, Sudan-South Sudan, Taiwan, Thailand, Togo, Tokelau-Manihiki, Tuamotu, Tubuai Is., Vietnam, West Himalaya, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed areas. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both coastal and inland environments. It is an important component of the vegetation in many of these regions.</p>
<p>Its widespread distribution reflects its ecological flexibility and ability to colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma viscosum was mainly introduced to Colombia, Ecuador, Gal√°pagos, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>It is a native species of Africa but has been widely distributed in these regions. The plant has been reported in various habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas. Its introduction may be due to human activities such as agriculture or accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact in these regions is still being studied.</p>
