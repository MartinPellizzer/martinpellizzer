<p>Aechmea corallina, commonly known as the coral pine, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, often resembling a coral-like structure. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Aechmea corallina is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
