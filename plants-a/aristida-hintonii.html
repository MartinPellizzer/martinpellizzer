<p>Aristida hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of three-awned lemma-like structures. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aristida hintonii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
