                    <h1>Aira × neumaniana</h1>
<p>Aira × neumaniana, commonly known as the hybrid false brome, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Aira cimbriformis and Aira praecox.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
