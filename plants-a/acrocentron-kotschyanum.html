                <h1>Acrocentron kotschyanum</h1>
<p>Acrocentron kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschyan's acrocentron, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm, with slender, hollow stems and finely divided leaves. Its small white or greenish flowers appear in clusters, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocentron kotschyanum has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and has a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind due to their lack of showy petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron kotschyanum is primarily native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>It is also found in the western regions of Turkey and extends into the eastern parts of the Mediterranean. This plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested slopes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron kotschyanum was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been reported in regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other introduced species.</p>
