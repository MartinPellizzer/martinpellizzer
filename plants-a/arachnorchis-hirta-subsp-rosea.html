<p>Arachnorchis hirta subsp.</p>
<p>rosea, commonly known as the pink-stemmed spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pinkish-green stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring.</p>
