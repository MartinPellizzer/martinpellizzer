<p>Actinocephalus camptophyllus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late summer. Its succulent leaves and compact growth form are adaptations to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus camptophyllus is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic species of alpine vegetation.</p>
