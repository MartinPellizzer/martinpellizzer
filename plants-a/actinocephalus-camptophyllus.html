                <h1>Actinocephalus camptophyllus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus camptophyllus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late summer. Its succulent leaves and compact growth form are adaptations to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus camptophyllus is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic species of alpine vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus camptophyllus has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus camptophyllus is primarily native to the eastern regions of Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in coastal dunes. This plant thrives in areas with a subtropical to temperate climate. It is often associated with coastal vegetation and can be found in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the eastern Australian coastline.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus camptophyllus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its unique leaf structure. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
