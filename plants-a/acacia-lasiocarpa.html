                    <h1>Acacia lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its distinctive, feathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Acacia lasiocarpa is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
