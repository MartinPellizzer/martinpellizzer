                <h1>Agave littoralis</h1>
<p>Agave littoralis, commonly known as the coastal agave, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in the spring. Agave littoralis is adapted to arid and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
