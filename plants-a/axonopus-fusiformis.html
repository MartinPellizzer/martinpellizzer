<p>It has narrow, flat leaves that are typically light green in color and form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and ornamental settings.</p>
