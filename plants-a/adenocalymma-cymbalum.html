                <h1>Adenocalymma cymbalum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma cymbalum, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma cymbalum is an important component of the local flora and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cymbalum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth and becomes fissured with age, growing in a creeping or trailing manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cymbalum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil. It typically grows in areas with tropical climates and is often associated with specific habitats such as forests or savannas. The plant is well adapted to the environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution highlights its ecological significance within the Brazilian flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cymbalum was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions, particularly in sandy soils. This plant is often seen growing in open habitats such as dunes and coastal heathlands. It has adapted well to the saline and windy conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in several areas along the coastline.</p>
