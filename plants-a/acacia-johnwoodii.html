                        <h1>Acacia johnwoodii</h1>
<p>Acacia johnwoodii, commonly known as the Johnwood's wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and phyllodes that are usually green and sometimes tinged with red. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia johnwoodii is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia johnwoodii is primarily native to the Northern Territory of Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Macdonnell Ranges and surrounding areas. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dry shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Acacia johnwoodii is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecosystem of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia johnwoodii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape, thriving in coastal and inland areas. This plant is often seen in fynbos vegetation, where it competes with native species. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
