                <h1>Aconitum aberratum</h1>
<p>Aconitum aberratum, commonly known as the aberrant monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. Aconitum aberratum is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially dangerous to humans and animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum aberratum has leaves that are compound, typically with 5 to 7 leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are usually lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, often reaching up to 2 meters in height, with a smooth, dark brown bark that is slightly rough to the touch. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spicate inflorescences, featuring blue to purple petals with a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
