                <h1>Acinodendron pterocaulon</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pterocaulon, commonly known as the winged acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces yellowish to greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its unique feature is the presence of winged, flattened pods that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pterocaulon has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branched structure. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pterocaulon is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry deciduous forests of the eastern and southern parts of the country. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives moderate to high levels of sunlight. It is commonly found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is restricted to Madagascar, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pterocaulon was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is a warm climate and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned farmlands. Its introduction has been documented in several countries across Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
