<p>Asplenium sandwichianum, commonly known as the Sandwich Islands spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its sporangia are found on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium sandwichianum is an important component of Hawaii's unique and diverse flora.</p>
