                <h1>Acropera luteola</h1>
<p>Acropera luteola, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acropera luteola is valued for its beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropera luteola has narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a light green bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera luteola is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in coastal and mangrove ecosystems, often growing along sandy shores and in brackish water environments. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it is adapted to similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Acropera luteola is an important component of the local flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera luteola was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in forests.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local biodiversity.</p>
