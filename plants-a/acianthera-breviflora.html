                <h1>Acianthera breviflora</h1>
<p>Acianthera breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating efficient water retention.</p>
<p>Acianthera breviflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera breviflora has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a light green bark that is smooth and slightly woody. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow sepals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera breviflora is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. This orchid species typically grows in humid forests and shaded environments. It is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>The plant's natural habitat is closely tied to the specific climatic conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera breviflora was mainly introduced to the region of South America, particularly in Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses due to its ornamental value. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a non-native species in most of its habitats.</p>
