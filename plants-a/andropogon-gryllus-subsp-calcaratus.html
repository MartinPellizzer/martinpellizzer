<p>Andropogon gryllus subsp.</p>
<p>calcaratus, commonly known as the sand bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, clump-like growths.</p>
<p>The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils, making it well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
