<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that often display shades of red, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows as a low, compact shrub with small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acalypha depressa is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha depressa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length, and a glossy green color that may turn reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright with some branching. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with stamen filaments, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp, dispersing by wind as the seeds are light and carried by the air.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha depressa is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Oceania and the Pacific Islands, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically within lowland rainforests or secondary growth areas. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Acalypha depressa is not listed as endangered, but its conservation status may vary depending on local habitat preservation and threats from deforestation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha depressa is a low-growing, flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, known for its vibrant foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick establishment. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs.</p>
