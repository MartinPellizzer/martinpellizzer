                <h1>Acalypha nigritiana</h1>
<p>Acalypha nigritiana, commonly known as black nightshade or blackleaf croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, almost black leaves that are often velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acalypha nigritiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha nigritiana has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a bright green color and a slightly pubescent surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha nigritiana is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, although its distribution is limited and it faces threats from habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha nigritiana is a striking tropical plant known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired characteristics. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for its health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
