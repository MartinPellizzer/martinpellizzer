                        <h1>Acer campestre var. mollissimum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. mollissimum, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, red or orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its compact form and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. mollissimum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including parts of Spain, France, Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>This variety of the common maple is typically found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and mild climates. It thrives in woodlands, along stream banks, and in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant is well adapted to temperate conditions and can tolerate partial shade.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its preference for cooler, humid habitats within its geographic area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. mollissimum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, rounded form and smooth, peeling bark.</p>
<p>It is often favored for its tolerance to urban environments and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is particularly popular in temperate regions for its aesthetic value and adaptability. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
