                    <h1>Arberella humilis</h1>
<p>Arberella humilis, commonly known as the dwarf arberella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. Arberella humilis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species.</p>
