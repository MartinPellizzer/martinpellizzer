<p>Artemisia grossheimii, commonly known as silver dust.</p>
<p>This plant is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features silvery-gray foliage with a distinctive aromatic scent, which is due to the high concentration of essential oils in its leaves. The small yellow flowers appear in late spring and are clustered in dense, spherical heads.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
