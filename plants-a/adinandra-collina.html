                <h1>Adinandra collina</h1>
<p>Adinandra collina, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is often found in regions with high humidity. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often branched.</p>
<p>Adinandra collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra collina has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular throat, blooming from July to September and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra collina is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Southeast Asian region. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically in lowland and hill forest areas. It is commonly encountered in the understorey vegetation of primary and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regionally important species within Borneo's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra collina was mainly introduced to urban and agricultural areas in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded forests. The plant is often associated with human activity and has become an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
