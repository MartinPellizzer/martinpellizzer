                <h1>Adinandra collina</h1>
<p>Adinandra collina, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and serrated edges. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent central stigma.</p>
<p>Adinandra collina thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra collina has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra collina is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Its native range is restricted to the eastern part of the island, specifically in the humid forests of the northeastern region. Although its current distribution is limited, it is found in scattered locations within its native habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Adinandra collina is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra collina is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. Common pests include scale insects and aphids, while diseases like root rot can occur in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adinandra collina is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating a diverse microhabitat. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling by improving soil fertility through organic matter decomposition.</p>
