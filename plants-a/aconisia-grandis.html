<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconisia grandis has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconisia grandis is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, specifically in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open grasslands and shrublands. Aconisia grandis grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>
