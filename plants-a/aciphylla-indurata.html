                <h1>Aciphylla indurata</h1>
<p>Aciphylla indurata, commonly known as the hard-leaved spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth. The plant has tough, fibrous leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Aciphylla indurata is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in coastal and inland regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla indurata has leaves that are spiny, triangular in shape, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a grayish-blue color and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture and a grayish-brown color, growing close to the ground. Its flowers are small, greenish-white in color, clustered in a dense inflorescence, and bloom during late winter to early spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla indurata is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the alpine and subalpine areas. This plant thrives in harsh, cold environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky and gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Aciphylla indurata plays an important ecological role in its native range, contributing to the biodiversity of New Zealand's unique ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla indurata was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and is adapted to survive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant's distribution is limited to certain parts of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve its natural range.</p>
