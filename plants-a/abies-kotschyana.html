                        <h1>Abies kotschyana</h1>
<p>Abies kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramid-shaped crown and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green with a white stomatal band. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
