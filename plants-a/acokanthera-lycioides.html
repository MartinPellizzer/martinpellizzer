                <h1>Acokanthera lycioides</h1>
<p>Acokanthera lycioides, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its highly toxic sap and seeds, which have been traditionally used in poison-tipped arrows by indigenous peoples.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera lycioides has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green in color, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically dark brown to grey in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white or pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera lycioides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland savannas and rocky outcrops where the climate is warm and relatively dry. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with shrubland and mountainous areas. It is also known to occur in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans alike.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera lycioides was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and northern parts of the country, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. It is known for its toxic properties and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a poison for hunting.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
