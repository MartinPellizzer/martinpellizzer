                <h1>Acinodendron mellinum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron mellinum, commonly known as the white-flowered acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on short, hairy peduncles. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with a distinctive glandular appearance.</p>
<p>Acinodendron mellinum is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mellinum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slightly woody texture as it matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mellinum is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, rocky habitats of Socotra, where it thrives in the unique and arid environment. This plant is part of the endemic flora of the island, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. It grows in limestone formations and is adapted to the extreme climate conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and valuable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mellinum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native forests and threatening local biodiversity. The plant's rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species have led to its classification as a noxious weed.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
