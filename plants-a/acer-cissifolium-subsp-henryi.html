                <h1>Acer cissifolium subsp. henryi</h1>
<p>Acer cissifolium subsp.</p>
<p>henryi, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cissifolium subsp.</p>
<p>henryi has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of red or orange, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over a wide area.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cissifolium subsp.</p>
<p>henryi is a rare plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Europe and North America, often as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions, typically found in forests and rocky slopes. This subspecies grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cissifolium subsp.</p>
<p>henryi is a rare and ornamental maple known for its delicate, fan-shaped leaves and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. This species has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, and thrives in cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cissifolium subsp.</p>
<p>henryi is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem health.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cissifolium subsp.</p>
<p>henryi is a lesser-known species of maple with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal infusions. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Its wood, though not widely utilized commercially, can be crafted into small decorative or functional items. Culturally, it is appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited research, its industrial and economic applications remain underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cissifolium subsp.</p>
<p>henryi has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage and ornamental value. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species to create unique varieties with enhanced hardiness and coloration.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates and soils, making them more versatile in horticultural settings. The species and its cultivars are valued for their autumn color and compact growth habit, contributing to landscape design.</p>
<p>Due to their aesthetic appeal and resilience, they hold significant horticultural importance in both public and private gardens.</p>
