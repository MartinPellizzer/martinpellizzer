<p>It has delicate, leathery fronds that are typically 10â€“20 cm long and are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round clusters called sori. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
