                    <h1>Agrostis pauciflora</h1>
<p>Agrostis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Agrostis pauciflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil and supporting insect life.</p>
