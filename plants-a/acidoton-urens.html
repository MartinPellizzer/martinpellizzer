                <h1>Acidoton urens</h1>
<p>Acidoton urens, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine,螫刺 (stinging) hairs. The plant contains a mixture of histamine, acetylcholine, and formic acid in its stinging hairs, which cause an itchy, burning sensation upon contact. Acidoton urens is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidoton urens has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton urens is primarily native to Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the island's tropical and subtropical regions. This plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils. It is often seen in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to Jamaica, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton urens was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. This plant has spread to several regions outside its native range, often outcompeting native species. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major ecological threat in all areas where it is established.</p>
