                <h1>Achyrospermum dasytrichum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum dasytrichum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hairy sunflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ornamental and sometimes invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum dasytrichum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 3 to 8 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish color, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are clustered in dense terminal inflorescences, with small, tubular corollas that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the warm season, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum dasytrichum is primarily native to Cameroon, Ghana, and Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in open woodland areas. It is known for its showy flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western part of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum dasytrichum was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found growing along roadsides, in disturbed soils, and in residential landscapes due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant is often considered an invasive species because of its ability to spread quickly and outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is largely attributed to its ornamental value, as it produces showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>However, its aggressive growth has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
