                    <h1>Antrizon tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Antrizon tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf antrizon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage is covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
