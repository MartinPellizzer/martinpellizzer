                <h1>Acrostichum fraxinifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum fraxinifolium, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fraxinifolium has large, feather-like leaves that are typically 1 to 2 meters long, with a pinnate arrangement, and they are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is robust and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that is usually brown in color. It produces inconspicuous, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, contributing to its stability in wet or swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fraxinifolium is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in humid lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is particularly prevalent in regions with a warm climate and high annual rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with wetlands and other waterlogged habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fraxinifolium was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands where it thrives in saline and waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant has been reported in several states along the southeastern United States. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is currently considered a minor weed with limited ecological impact.</p>
