<p>Arenaria congesta, commonly known as sand pink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria congesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
