                <h1>Abelicea keaki</h1>
<p>Abelicea keaki, commonly known as the Hawaiian flame tree, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves and can grow up to 15 meters tall, making it a striking feature in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in other tropical regions as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelicea keaki has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a yellowish-white color, blooming during the spring season and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils by forming symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelicea keaki is a rare plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While its native range was once extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations due to habitat loss and fragmentation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil, typically found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Abelicea keaki is typically found at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelicea keaki is a unique plant known for its striking foliage and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Abelicea keaki is relatively slow, with noticeable growth during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelicea keaki is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the surrounding flora. The plant also acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in the area. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting it from degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Abelicea keaki plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>
