                <h1>Aconitum gammiei</h1>
<p>Aconitum gammiei, commonly known as the Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as aconitine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is handled with caution and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum gammiei has leaves that are compound, typically with 5 to 11 leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and are usually lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a purple or reddish-brown bark that is somewhat woody in texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, with five petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, serving as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gammiei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters. Its distribution is closely associated with the mountain ranges of the Tien Shan and Pamir regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and has a limited geographical range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gammiei was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and intentional cultivation by gardeners and botanists interested in its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas across the eastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The plant has been reported in several states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, where it thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. Due to its attractive blue-purple flowers, it has become a popular addition to native plant gardens, although its invasive potential remains a topic of concern.</p>
<p>Its distribution continues to expand as it is increasingly cultivated and released into the wild.</p>
