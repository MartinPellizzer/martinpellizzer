                <h1>Actinocephalus aggregatus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered star-leaf, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus aggregatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flower structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus aggregatus has small, simple leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus aggregatus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these countries. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing on limestone outcrops. It is a succulent shrub that is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a characteristic species of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus aggregatus was mainly introduced to coastal areas of southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its effects on native flora.</p>
