                <h1>Actinodaphne glabra</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne glabra, commonly known as the smooth actinodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a drupe with a smooth, fleshy exterior.</p>
<p>This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its aromatic properties and potential medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glabra has simple, elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns bright red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy pulp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, forming a dense network near the soil surface to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glabra is primarily native to Borneo and Jawa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. This plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas. It is often associated with limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glabra was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions where it can thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as secondary forests, along roadsides, and in degraded landscapes. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and even some regions of the Americas. Its spread is often associated with human activity, including the transportation of plant materials for ornamental or medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become an invasive species in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
