<p>Actinodaphne glabra, commonly known as the smooth actinodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color.</p>
<p>The fruit is a drupe, which contains a single seed, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glabra has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with three petals and three sepals, blooming between May and August, and is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and droppings.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glabra is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China and the Andaman Islands, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. It prefers lowland to hill forests, often growing in shaded understory areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Actinodaphne glabra is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as near threatened, highlighting the need for further research and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glabra is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and aromatic leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5–7 years, and thrives in warm, humid climates with indirect light.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract scale insects or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its growth in a tropical garden.</p>
