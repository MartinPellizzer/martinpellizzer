                    <h1>Austrocylindropuntia lagopus</h1>
<p>Austrocylindropuntia lagopus, commonly known as the rock cactus or the desert rose, is a species of cactus native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Austrocylindropuntia lagopus thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for harsh desert conditions.</p>
