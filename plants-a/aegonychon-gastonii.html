                    <h1>Aegonychon gastonii</h1>
<p>Aegonychon gastonii, commonly known as the Gaston's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with delicate, translucent petals that resemble spectral forms. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late winter, adding to its ethereal beauty. Aegonychon gastonii is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is subject to conservation efforts to protect its fragile ecosystem.</p>
