<p>Acalypha amentacea var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf acalypha, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, drooping clusters called catkins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in some habitats.</p>
