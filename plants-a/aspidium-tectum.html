<p>Aspidium tectum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Aspidium tectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
