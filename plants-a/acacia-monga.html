<p>Acacia monga, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green to golden flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia monga is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia monga is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, heathlands, and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia monga is also known for its ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia monga was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a source of fuelwood in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, South Africa, and parts of the Middle East. The plant thrives in dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it valuable for land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
