<p>Aristida vulgaris var. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian threeawn, is a grass species native to regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and fine, wiry leaves, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows in open grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, producing small, pale green to brown florets that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
