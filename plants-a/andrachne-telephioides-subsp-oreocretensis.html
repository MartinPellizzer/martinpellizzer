<p>Andrachne telephioides subsp.</p>
<p>oreocretensis, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions.</p>
