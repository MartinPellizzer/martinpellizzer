                        <h1>Abies fraseri var. nana</h1>
<p>Abies fraseri var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Fraser fir, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and short, stiff needles that are dark green with a slight blue tint. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically retained on the branches for several years. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-elevation forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a specimen plant in landscaped settings.</p>
