<p>Anathallis escalerensis, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, translucent, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
