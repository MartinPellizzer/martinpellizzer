                <h1>Adelobotrys atlanticus</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic adelobotrys, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>It is adapted to salt spray and is considered an indicator species for coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys atlanticus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys atlanticus is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the northeastern part of Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in humid forests and near riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific region in Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys atlanticus was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dunes and along shorelines. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
