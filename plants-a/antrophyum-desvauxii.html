<p>Antrophyum desvauxii, commonly known as the Desvaux's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a significant subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
