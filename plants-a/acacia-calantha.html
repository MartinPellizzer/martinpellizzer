                <h1>Acacia calantha</h1>
<p>Acacia calantha, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Acacia calantha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is a symbol of Australian national identity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia calantha has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval leaflets arranged in feathery clusters, giving the plant a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a slightly glossy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form. The flowers are yellow and arranged in dense, globular clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia calantha is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now also found in parts of Australia and the Mediterranean, often as a result of human introduction. This plant thrives in hot, dry environments with well-drained soils, commonly found in savannas and rocky outcrops. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its distribution has been impacted by habitat loss and climate change, leading to concerns for its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia calantha is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to South Africa, known for its vibrant yellow flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 3-5 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Regular watering during the growing season is essential, but it should be reduced in winter to prevent root rot. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead or damaged branches to maintain shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
