<p>Acer pubinerve var. apiferum, commonly known as the hairy-veined maple, is a variant of the pubinerve maple characterized by its distinctive pubescent (hairy) veins on the leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically palmately lobed with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in temperate forests. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is appreciated in horticulture due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
