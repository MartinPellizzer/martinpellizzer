<p>Anthocarapa nitidula, commonly known as the glossy anthocarapa, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>
