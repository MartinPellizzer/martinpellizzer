                <h1>Acer dasycarpum pyramidale</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum pyramidale, commonly known as the Himalayan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, conical growth habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. It produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with two papery wings.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum pyramidale has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, reaching up to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in clusters. The fruit is a samara, a winged capsule that disperses by wind, with seeds enclosed within.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum pyramidale is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate forests and rocky slopes. This species grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum pyramidale is a striking ornamental tree known for its pyramidal shape and vibrant fall foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in temperate climates with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its structure, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though aphids and scale may occasionally infest it.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum pyramidale is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, playing a role in mitigating climate change.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum pyramidale is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in landscaping and horticulture for its striking pyramidal shape and vibrant autumn foliage. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically valued for furniture and carpentry. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat respiratory and skin conditions.</p>
