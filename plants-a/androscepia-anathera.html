<p>Androscepia anathera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological needs, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
