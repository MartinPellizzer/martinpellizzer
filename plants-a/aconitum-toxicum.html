                <h1>Aconitum toxicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum toxicum, commonly known as the western aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spikelike inflorescence. Its roots and rhizomes contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often referred to as "monkshood" because of the shape of its helmet-like flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum toxicum has leaves that are compound, palmately divided into 5-11 leaflets, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, with spurred petals and a showy structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies; they bloom in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, often forming a dense, underground network.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum toxicum is primarily native to Romania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and grasslands across the country. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in alpine and subalpine areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the natural habitats of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum toxicum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant was introduced primarily through horticultural trade and accidental dispersal. It has since spread to various disturbed sites and has become a concern in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it poses a risk to both livestock and humans.</p>
