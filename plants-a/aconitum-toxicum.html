                    <h1>Aconitum toxicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum toxicum, commonly known as the western aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spikelike inflorescence. Its roots and rhizomes contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often referred to as "monkshood" because of the shape of its helmet-like flowers.</p>
