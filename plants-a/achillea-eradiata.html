                <h1>Achillea eradiata</h1>
<p>Achillea eradiata, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, bright green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea eradiata has compound, feather-like leaves that are gray-green in color, with a silvery-white underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth, slightly hairy surface, and it grows in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea eradiata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries like Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>It is now found across much of Europe and has been introduced to parts of North America and Australia. This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its relatively widespread distribution and adaptability, Achillea eradiata is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea eradiata is a flowering plant known for its showy yellow blooms and hardy nature, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with division being the most effective method for maintaining genetic consistency. This perennial plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden’s aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea eradiata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion by stabilizing the ground with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea eradiata contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea eradiata is a perennial plant known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional medicine where it has been used to treat respiratory and skin conditions.</p>
<p>It is also valued in culinary applications, with its leaves and flowers used to flavor teas and dishes in certain regions. Industrially, it contributes to the production of essential oils, which are used in perfumery and aromatherapy. Culturally, it symbolizes healing and protection in various indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological restoration further highlights its economic and environmental significance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea eradiata has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are known for their vibrant foliage and showy flower heads. While there are fewer hybrids specifically bred for Achillea eradiata compared to other species in the genus, some crosses have been developed to enhance traits like color and hardiness. These plants hold significant horticultural importance as they are used in gardens for their long blooming period and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them a favored choice for both landscape design and cut flower arrangements.</p>
