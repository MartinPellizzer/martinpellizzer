                <h1>Achillea eradiata</h1>
<p>Achillea eradiata, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is perennial, reaching heights of up to 60 cm, and is known for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>The flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in ecological landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea eradiata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically 5–10 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea eradiata is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon.</p>
<p>It is now also found in some areas of southern Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in mountainous and semi-arid environments. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Achillea eradiata is considered a species of concern and is listed as near threatened by some conservation organizations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea eradiata is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental value and easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a growth cycle that begins with new shoots in spring, followed by flowering in summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its vigor and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
