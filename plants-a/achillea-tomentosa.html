                <h1>Achillea tomentosa</h1>
<p>Achillea tomentosa, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as meadows and rocky slopes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the Greek myth of Achilles, who was said to have used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tomentosa has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped (spatulate), and covered in fine white hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a bluish-gray color due to the dense pubescence. The stem is upright, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a grayish-green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are pale yellow to white, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tomentosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as steppes, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and hot, dry summers. It is often seen growing along roadsides, in open fields, and on slopes.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from southern France through Spain, Italy, and into the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tomentosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fluffy white flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This plant has since become naturalized in several areas, often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its introduction has led to some concerns regarding its potential to invade native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite this, it remains a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy and low-maintenance plant.</p>
