<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to spread over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tomentosa is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in temperate regions around the world, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its introduction to new areas can sometimes lead to ecological concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea tomentosa is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it an excellent choice for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring, ensuring a quick establishment of new plants. The growth cycle of Achillea tomentosa includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer. For optimal growth, it requires moderate watering and light fertilization in early spring, along with regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new blooms.</p>
<p>While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered, and it pairs well with plants like lavender or thyme for companion planting.</p>
