<p>Ammi indicum, commonly known as wild carrot or bishop's weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are often mistaken for those of the cultivated carrot. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small, crescent-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Ammi indicum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates.</p>
