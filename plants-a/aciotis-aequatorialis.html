                <h1>Aciotis aequatorialis</h1>
<p>Aciotis aequatorialis, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flower heads consist of numerous small florets, and it produces achenes as its seeds.</p>
<p>Aciotis aequatorialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis aequatorialis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring small, tubular petals with a yellowish-orange color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis aequatorialis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and lowland areas with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in open grasslands and disturbed soils, often growing near rivers and streams. It is an important component of the local flora in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the equatorial and subtropical zones of the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis aequatorialis was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and waste lands. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a persistent weed in many ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native flora in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
