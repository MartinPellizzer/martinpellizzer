                        <h1>Abrus precatorius subsp. africanus</h1>
<p>Abrus precatorius subsp.</p>
<p>africanus, commonly known as the African jequirity, is a climbing legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds covered in a silky, white coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its seeds contain abrin, a potent toxin that can be lethal if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abrus precatorius subsp.</p>
<p>africanus belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and algae that have a complex life cycle and are characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their unique reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and are often associated with early diverging lineages in the angiosperms. Its order is Fabales, which includes plants with legumes and often has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Abrus, a group of flowering plants known for their striking and often toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Its species is Abrus precatorius, a plant known for its ornamental red seeds and toxic properties, with the subspecies africanus being a variant found in Africa.</p>
