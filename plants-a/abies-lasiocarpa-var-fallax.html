                        <h1>Abies lasiocarpa var. fallax</h1>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa var. fallax, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a variant of the subalpine fir native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The cones of this variety are typically small and often hang downward, a distinguishing feature from other fir species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh alpine conditions and its role in forest ecosystems at elevations above tree line.</p>
