                <h1>Actinidia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Actinidia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia lanceolata has compound leaves that are alternate, with lanceolate-shaped leaflets, typically 5â€“9 cm long, dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a vigorous climbing shrub or vine. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary cymes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a bright red, fuzzy berry that matures in late summer, dispersing primarily by birds eating the fruit and scattering the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia lanceolata is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within southeastern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia lanceolata was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes, particularly in regions with temperate climates. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems. Its spread is often facilitated by birds and animals that consume its berries.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is necessary to prevent its unintended ecological impact.</p>
