                <h1>Actinodaphne cuspidata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuspidata has elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with six petals and three sepals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuspidata is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Indian subcontinent and the Andaman Islands, though it is less common outside its native range. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests, often growing near rivers and in secondary vegetation. The species is typically found at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuspidata is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its aromatic leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while common pests like aphids and spider mites, along with fungal diseases, should be monitored.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants such as ginger or citrus can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuspidata is a tropical plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its fragrant flowers and nectar-rich nectar. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the ecosystem. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of the region.</p>
