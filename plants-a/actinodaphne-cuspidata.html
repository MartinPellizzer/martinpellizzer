                <h1>Actinodaphne cuspidata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been traditionally used in medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuspidata has elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly woody, with a pale brown bark that peels in thin layers, growing as a straight, upright shrub or small tree. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuspidata is primarily native to the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its distribution extends to some islands in the Pacific Ocean, such as the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.</p>
<p>It is often associated with limestone soils and is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuspidata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains a subject of ongoing study.</p>
