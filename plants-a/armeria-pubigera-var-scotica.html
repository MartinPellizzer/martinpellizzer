                    <h1>Armeria pubigera var. scotica</h1>
<p>Armeria pubigera var. scotica, commonly known as the Scottish sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Scotland.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, salty habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shorelines.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
