                <h1>Acer obtusatum subsp. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum, commonly known as the tomentose maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rounded base and serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in late summer.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are broad and rounded, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, with winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Asia, including Japan and Korea, and is occasionally found in botanical gardens outside its original habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often growing in cool, humid climates. This subspecies typically occurs at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum is a slow-growing, deciduous shrub or small tree known for its attractive, fuzzy leaves and autumn color. It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in summer or by seed harvested in autumn, though the latter has a low germination rate.</p>
<p>This species prefers well-drained, acidic soil and moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in wet conditions, and it pairs well with ferns and heathers in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecological balance. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, particularly in woodland and forest edges.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Its bark and leaves may have medicinal applications in local folk medicine, though scientific validation is lacking.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value makes it a candidate for horticultural use in landscaping and garden design. It holds cultural significance in certain regions where it is revered for its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and symbolic than industrial or economic.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Kewensis', which are known for their vibrant autumn colors and unique foliage patterns. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color, making them more adaptable to different climates.</p>
<p>These hybrids often combine the aesthetic appeal of the subspecies with improved horticultural performance. The plant's cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in gardens and landscapes for their ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a range of conditions.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance continues to grow due to its beauty and versatility in modern landscaping.</p>
