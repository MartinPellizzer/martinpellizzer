This species is well adapted to moist environments and can tolerate a range of soil types. It is commonly encountered in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it contributes to the region's biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon pilosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
