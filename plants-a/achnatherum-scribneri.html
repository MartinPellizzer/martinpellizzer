                <h1>Achnatherum scribneri</h1>
<p>Achnatherum scribneri, commonly known as Scribner's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>Achnatherum scribneri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum scribneri has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a spiral along the stem, and vary in length from 10 to 30 centimeters, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to grayish color, growing upright and often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with greenish to beige flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients from the environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum scribneri is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in states such as California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This grass species is typically associated with open habitats like grasslands, dunes, and disturbed areas. It thrives in environments with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Achnatherum scribneri is an important part of the ecological balance in these regions, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum scribneri was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and along creek banks. This plant is typically associated with dry to moist meadows and prairies, where it forms dense colonies. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native grasses in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and use in restoration projects.</p>
