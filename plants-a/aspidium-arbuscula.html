                    <h1>Aspidium arbuscula</h1>
<p>Aspidium arbuscula, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, tree-like structure.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered with remnants of old fronds, which give it a unique appearance. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along the leaf stalks. Aspidium arbuscula is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of many ecosystems.</p>
