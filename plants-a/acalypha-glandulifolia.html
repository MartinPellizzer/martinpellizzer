                        <h1>Acalypha glandulifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha glandulifolia, commonly known as the glandular acalypha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its striking, often colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have glandular dots along the veins.</p>
<p>Acalypha glandulifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha glandulifolia belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of specialized structures such as stomata and vascular tissue. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their primitive features and often having jointed stems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many species with unique adaptations such as symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with latex and often showy flowers. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "broadleaf," characterized by their distinctive leaves and often showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha glandulifolia, a specific type within the genus Acalypha known for its glandular leaves and is native to tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha glandulifolia is primarily native to Eswatini, KwaZulu-Natal, and Northern Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha glandulifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structures. The plant has also been introduced to some island ecosystems, where it can become invasive if not managed properly. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success in new environments.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in certain areas.</p>
