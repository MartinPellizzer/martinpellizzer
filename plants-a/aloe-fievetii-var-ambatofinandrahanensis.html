                    <h1>Aloe fievetii var. ambatofinandrahanensis</h1>
<p>Aloe fievetii var. ambatofinandrahanensis, commonly known as the Ambatofinandraha aloe, is a rare and unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region.</p>
