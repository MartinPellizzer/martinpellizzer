<p>Araliorhamnus punctulata, commonly known as the spotted boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, oval leaves that are often dotted with glandular dots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss.</p>
