                <h1>Adesmia horrida</h1>
<p>Adesmia horrida, commonly known as the rough adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Adesmia horrida is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological significance in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia horrida has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are usually hairy and have a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a grayish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia horrida is primarily native to Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Chile Central, and Chile North.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in dry, rocky, and often disturbed habitats. Adesmia horrida is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in low-nutrient soils and high solar exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia horrida was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in these habitats. The plant spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. It is considered an invasive species in several regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
