                <h1>Acinodendron arboreum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron arboreum, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron arboreum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin, papery strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron arboreum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in the understory of humid tropical forests. The plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures, typically between sea level and 1,000 meters in elevation. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats, making it a common sight in logged or degraded forests.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally found in adjacent regions such as the Philippines and parts of India.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron arboreum was mainly introduced to specific regions in Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its potential use in agroforestry and soil stabilization due to its ability to thrive in degraded lands. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which are valued in local diets. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
