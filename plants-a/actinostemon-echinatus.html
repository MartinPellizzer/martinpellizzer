                <h1>Actinostemon echinatus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon echinatus, commonly known as the spiny actinostemon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Actinostemon echinatus is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon echinatus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habit of growing in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon echinatus is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil. It grows in tropical and subtropical environments within these areas. The distribution includes parts of the Atlantic Forest biome.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, shaded understory habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon echinatus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural environments. It is now considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
