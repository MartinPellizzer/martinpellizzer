<p>Anacamptis pyramidalis var. cerigensis, commonly known as the Cerignola orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
