                <h1>Actaea densiflora</h1>
<p>Actaea densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered actaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soils. Its fruit is a follicle that contains numerous small, dark seeds.</p>
<p>Actaea densiflora is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea densiflora has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a single trunk. Its small white to pale pink flowers are clustered in upright cymes, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate composed of small achenes, which are dispersed by birds eating the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in shaded woodland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea densiflora is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from New York southward to Florida and westward to Texas.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. This plant is commonly found in the Appalachian Mountains and surrounding regions. It prefers rich, loamy soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Actaea densiflora is an herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea densiflora was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been found in various regions including the eastern and central United States. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in certain areas.</p>
<p>However, its current distribution remains limited and does not yet pose a major ecological threat.</p>
