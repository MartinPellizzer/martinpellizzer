                <h1>Aechmea aquilega</h1>
<p>Aechmea aquilega, commonly known as the velvet leaf bromeliad, is a perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a dense, velvety coating of trichomes, which helps in water retention. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea aquilega has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a compact spiral, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, fibrous stem with a smooth, dark green bark that grows upward from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red and orange, and bloom during the dry season, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
