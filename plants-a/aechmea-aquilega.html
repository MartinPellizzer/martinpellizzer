<p>Aechmea aquilega, commonly known as the velvet leaf bromeliad, is a perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a dense, velvety coating of trichomes, which helps in water retention. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
