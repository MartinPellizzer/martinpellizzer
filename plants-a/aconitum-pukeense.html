                <h1>Aconitum pukeense</h1>
<p>Aconitum pukeense, commonly known as the Pukeko River aconite, is a striking perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple spathaceous flowers that are clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Aconitum pukeense contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pukeense has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, dark green in color, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and somewhat hairy, with a bluish-green bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, and consist of five petals with a spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pukeense is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Otago and Southland. This plant grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open habitats such as scree slopes and dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pukeense was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forested areas. It has become naturalized in parts of the North Island.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses no significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
