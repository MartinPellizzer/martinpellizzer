                    <h1>Agave consociata</h1>
<p>Agave consociata, commonly known as the clustered agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by small, spiky fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Agave consociata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
