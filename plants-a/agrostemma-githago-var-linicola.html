                    <h1>Agrostemma githago var. linicola</h1>
<p>Agrostemma githago var. linicola, commonly known as the slender goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features slender, branching stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a spiky, hairy capsule that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
