                <h1>Acer circinatum</h1>
<p>Acer circinatum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically palmately lobed and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer circinatum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, a group of flowering plants that includes trees and shrubs, often with compound leaves and fruit types such as drupes or capsules. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with showy flowers and often toxic fruits. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maples, which are deciduous trees or shrubs with opposite leaves and distinctive samaras.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer circinatum, commonly known as the vine maple, a small tree or shrub native to western North America, characterized by its weeping growth habit and palmate leaves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer circinatum has leaves that are alternate, palmately lobed, and have a distinctive cinnamon-brown color when they first emerge, turning bright yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, and typically measure 5â€“12 cm in length. The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a slender, upright growth pattern and a tendency to branch near the base. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native Pacific Northwest habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer circinatum is a species of maple native to western North America, specifically found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. This plant typically grows in coniferous or mixed forests, often along stream banks and in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acer circinatum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating that it is not currently threatened with extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer circinatum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a dormant period in winter, followed by new growth in spring and active growth in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with evergreens and flowering shrubs in garden design.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer circinatum is a vital component of Pacific Northwest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals. The plant acts as a companion species that enhances biodiversity in forest understories. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer circinatum is a decorative tree known for its vibrant red foliage, making it a popular choice in landscaping and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>While its berries are not typically used in culinary applications, the tree's aesthetic value contributes to the horticultural industry. In traditional medicine, some indigenous communities have used parts of the tree for its potential therapeutic properties. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in Pacific Northwest regions, representing natural beauty and ecological balance.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local wildlife and contributing to biodiversity also highlights its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer circinatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Emerald Queen' and 'Crimson King', which are known for their vibrant foliage colors. The species is also used in hybridization to create new cultivars with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and extended fall color. These hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer circinatum plays a significant role in the ornamental plant industry due to its visual impact and versatility.</p>
