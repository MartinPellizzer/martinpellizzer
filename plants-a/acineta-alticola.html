<p>Acineta alticola, commonly known as the mountain acineta, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of countries like Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants such as carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit, finely divided leaves, and white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acineta alticola is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
