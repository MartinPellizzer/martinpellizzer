                <h1>Acineta alticola</h1>
<p>Acineta alticola, commonly known as the mountain acineta, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of countries like Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants such as carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit, finely divided leaves, and white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acineta alticola is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta alticola has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, white flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta alticola is primarily native to Brazil North and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, forested areas with well-drained soil. Acineta alticola is adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta alticola was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites where soil stability is poor. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
