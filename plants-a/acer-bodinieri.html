                <h1>Acer bodinieri</h1>
<p>Acer bodinieri, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental red foliage, which turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree has opposite, pinnate leaves that are typically three to five lobed. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits.</p>
<p>Acer bodinieri is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer bodinieri has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a broad ovate shape, dark green on top, and pale green underneath, reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clustered inflorescences, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the light, feathery wings.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer bodinieri is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, with some specimens also found in northern Vietnam. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate to subtropical forests, typically at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer bodinieri is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this critically threatened species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer bodinieri is a striking maple tree known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acer bodinieri includes a period of rapid growth in spring, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or scale, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with grasses or shrubs can enhance its growth and provide ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer bodinieri is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other plant species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer bodinieri contributes to carbon sequestration, supporting overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer bodinieri is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and unique tree shape, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and urban green spaces. While not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat ailments such as coughs and inflammation. The tree also plays a role in cultural symbolism, often representing resilience and beauty in regional folklore.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the forestry and horticultural industries, supporting local livelihoods through its aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer bodinieri has several popular cultivars such as 'Carnegie', 'Dissectum', and 'Sutherlandii', which are valued for their unique foliage patterns and ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in various hybrids, including the widely cultivated 'Autumn Flame' and 'Red Sunset', which exhibit enhanced coloration and growth habits. These hybrids are particularly important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in a range of climates and their vibrant autumn displays. The plant's genetic diversity contributes to the development of new cultivars with improved traits such as disease resistance and cold hardiness.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer bodinieri plays a significant role in the horticultural landscape due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
