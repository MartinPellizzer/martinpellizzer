                    <h1>Arundarbor horsfieldii</h1>
<p>Arundarbor horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's arundinaria, is a rare and endangered grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline.</p>
