<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes species like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into woody, edible pods. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus smeathmanii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellow petals and a distinctive green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus smeathmanii is a rare cycad-like plant native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is restricted to the limestone cliffs and rocky outcrops of the island's interior. While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus smeathmanii is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically thriving in warm, humid conditions with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot.
