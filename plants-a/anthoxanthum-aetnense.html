                    <h1>Anthoxanthum aetnense</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum aetnense, commonly known as the Etna golden grass, is a perennial grass species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
