                <h1>Acer × veitchii</h1>
<p>Acer × veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree originating from the cross between Acer palmatum and Acer japonicum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6–10 meters and features a rounded, compact form. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × veitchii has palmately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate or five-lobed, with a broad, ovate shape, alternate arrangement, and a vibrant green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in upright catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, providing stability and efficient nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × veitchii is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and parks across temperate regions of the world, including North America and Europe. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, typically growing in forested or open landscapes. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered in the wild, its hybrid origin and limited natural range make it a subject of interest for conservation and botanical study.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × veitchii is a hybrid maple known for its vibrant fall color and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>
