                    <h1>Atraphaxis spinosa var. glauca</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis spinosa var. glauca, commonly known as the blue desert holly, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and small, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss and reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
