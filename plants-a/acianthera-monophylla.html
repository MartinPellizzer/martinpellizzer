                <h1>Acianthera monophylla</h1>
<p>Acianthera monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, broad leaf and a compact inflorescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera monophylla has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a slightly hairy texture and a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals with a pinkish base, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera monophylla is primarily native to Jamaica.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Caribbean island nation, specifically in the humid tropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Jamaica.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera monophylla was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, making it well-suited for these regions. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport. It has since become established in native wetland ecosystems, sometimes competing with native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
