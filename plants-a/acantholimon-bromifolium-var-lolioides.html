<p>Acantholimon bromifolium var. lolioides, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
