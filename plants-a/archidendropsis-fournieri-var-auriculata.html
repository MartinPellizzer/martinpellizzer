<p>Archidendropsis fournieri var. auriculata, commonly known as the golden ear cactus, is a unique succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with a distinctive golden hue, which gives it its common name. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces yellow flowers during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to dry conditions.</p>
