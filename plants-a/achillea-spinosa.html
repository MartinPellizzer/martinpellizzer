                <h1>Achillea spinosa</h1>
<p>Achillea spinosa, commonly known as the thorny yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with silver-gray, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads that are arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and its resemblance to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea spinosa has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a grayish-green color and a woolly texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, sparsely branched, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets and dark brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spinosa is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils. It is particularly prevalent in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spinosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and rocky areas due to its hardy nature. The plant has been spread through seed dispersal by wind and water, contributing to its wide distribution. It is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in areas where it establishes itself aggressively.</p>
