                <h1>Achillea spinosa</h1>
<p>Achillea spinosa, commonly known as the thorny yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its woody, branched stems and is often found in rocky or dry soils. It has a long flowering period, typically from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Achillea spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea spinosa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are released in early autumn.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spinosa is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions of Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Mediterranean basin, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. This species typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and coastal areas. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Achillea spinosa is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea spinosa is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. It has a biennial growth cycle, blooming in its second year before dying back, though it often reseeds itself for continued growth.</p>
<p>Achillea spinosa prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of compost in early spring, while pruning dead foliage after flowering helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
