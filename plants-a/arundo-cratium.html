                    <h1>Arundo cratium</h1>
<p>Arundo cratium, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in riparian zones. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Arundo cratium is also valued for its use in basket-making and as a source of thatching in traditional cultures.</p>
