                    <h1>Alsine juniperina var. glandulifera</h1>
<p>Alsine juniperina var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular juniperweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are often concealed among the foliage, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its glandular structures on the stems and leaves help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer plant in ecological succession.</p>
