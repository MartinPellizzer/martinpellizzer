                <h1>Achyranthes laguroides</h1>
<p>Achyranthes laguroides, commonly known as the Indian knotgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Achyranthes laguroides is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes laguroides has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals and stamens, blooming from April to June and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spreading, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes laguroides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in wetlands, riverbanks, and other humid environments. It is also present in some regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to warm, wet climates with abundant rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes laguroides was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and anthropogenic habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in several regions of South America, including Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. Its distribution is often associated with human activity and land modification.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
