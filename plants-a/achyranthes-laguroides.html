                <h1>Achyranthes laguroides</h1>
<p>Achyranthes laguroides, commonly known as the Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to South Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in capsule-like fruits, which are characteristic of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its fibrous stems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes laguroides has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 3–8 cm long and 1–3 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in summer and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes laguroides is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in parts of Africa and the Americas, expanding its current distribution beyond its native range. This species thrives in moist, tropical environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. It is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status remains uncertain due to limited research and habitat degradation in some regions.</p>
