                <h1>Acilepis pothigaiana</h1>
<p>Acilepis pothigaiana, commonly known as the Pothigaian acilepis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Acilepis pothigaiana is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis pothigaiana has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis pothigaiana is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense, biodiverse ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of large trees. It plays a vital role in the local flora by contributing to the ecological balance and supporting various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis pothigaiana was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was introduced primarily as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, its spread has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful monitoring is necessary to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
