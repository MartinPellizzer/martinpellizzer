<p>Adiantum gracile, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bioluminescent fronds that often appear silvery or translucent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Adiantum gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
