                <h1>Acronia stelidilabia</h1>
<p>Acronia stelidilabia, commonly known as the star-labiated acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that are often adorned with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Acronia stelidilabia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is known for its unique floral structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia stelidilabia has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, covered in a rough, grayish bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia stelidilabia is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is found in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It is commonly associated with sandy or rocky soils in these areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia stelidilabia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its unique, star-shaped leaves and delicate white flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils near human settlements. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in the regions where it has been introduced.</p>
