                <h1>Aegilops sharonensis</h1>
<p>Aegilops sharonensis, commonly known as Sharon grass, is a wild relative of wheat native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets. It has been studied for its potential in wheat breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and useful traits.</p>
<p>Aegilops sharonensis thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops sharonensis has leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a linear shape, alternate arrangement, and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a greenish hue and a growth pattern that is typically upright. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to white florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed primarily by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant is commonly found.</p>
