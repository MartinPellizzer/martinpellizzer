                <h1>Acosmium lentiscifolium</h1>
<p>Acosmium lentiscifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acosmium, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and scrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium lentiscifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a leathery texture and a dark green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, which are woody, rough in texture, and have a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, with five petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium lentiscifolium is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly spanning southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, as well as in dry, scrubland environments. This plant thrives in regions with a warm, temperate climate and well-drained soils. It is often associated with limestone and calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium lentiscifolium was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has been introduced to several regions in the Mediterranean, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. It is also found in some areas of the United States, particularly in coastal states like Florida and California.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
