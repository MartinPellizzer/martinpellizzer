<p>Artemisia tomentella, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. Artemisia tomentella is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
