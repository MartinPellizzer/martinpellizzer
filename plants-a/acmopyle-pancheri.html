                <h1>Acmopyle pancheri</h1>
<p>Acmopyle pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri's acmopyle, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmopyle pancheri has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with five petals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its arid habitat by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmopyle pancheri is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this French overseas territory. It thrives in the unique and biodiverse environments of New Caledonia's rainforests and coastal areas. The plant is adapted to the specific climatic and geological conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to New Caledonia, making it an endemic species of significant ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmopyle pancheri was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges. It is considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread throughout much of New Zealand's North Island.</p>
