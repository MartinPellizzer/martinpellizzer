<p>Angelica hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, containing volatile oils that give it a strong, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Angelica hirsuta is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
