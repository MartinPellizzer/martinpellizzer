<p>Aira alpina f. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved alpine airgrass, is a variant of the alpine airgrass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, flat, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds typical of its environment.</p>
