<p>Aphora pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy aphora, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
