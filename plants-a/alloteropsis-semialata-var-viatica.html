                    <h1>Alloteropsis semialata var. viatica</h1>
<p>Alloteropsis semialata var. viatica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
