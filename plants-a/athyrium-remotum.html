<p>Athyrium remotum, commonly known as the remote lady fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Athyrium remotum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions.</p>
