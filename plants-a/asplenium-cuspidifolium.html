<p>Asplenium cuspidifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a pointed tip, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium cuspidifolium is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in humid, temperate climates.</p>
