<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a large amount of lightweight pollen, which is a major allergen. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves distinguish it from other Ambrosia species.</p>
