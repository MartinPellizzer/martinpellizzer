                    <h1>Alloceratium</h1>
<p>Alloceratium, commonly known as the false truffle, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Tuberaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of various plants, particularly in forest ecosystems. They are characterized by their fleshy, subterranean fruiting bodies that resemble truffles. Alloceratium species are often found in temperate regions and are valued for their unique aroma and culinary use.</p>
<p>However, they are not as widely cultivated or consumed as true truffles.</p>
