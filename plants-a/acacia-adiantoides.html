<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia adiantoides is primarily native to the dry forests and woodlands of northern South America, particularly in countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate, often found in areas with well-drained soils. This species is commonly associated with the transition zones between forest and savanna, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. It is also found in some parts of Central America, including Panama and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be seen in disturbed or secondary growth areas within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia adiantoides was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sunlight. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can colonize open habitats quickly. Its rapid growth makes it a potential invasive species in some environments.</p>
