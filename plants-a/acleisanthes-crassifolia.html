                <h1>Acleisanthes crassifolia</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas and in desert scrub habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes crassifolia has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that are pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by anchoring the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes crassifolia is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with disturbed or open habitats. It is adapted to the hot and dry climate typical of its native range.</p>
<p>The species is an important part of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes crassifolia was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds in these regions. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in arid environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>It is typically found growing in clusters with its distinctive yellow flowers attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
