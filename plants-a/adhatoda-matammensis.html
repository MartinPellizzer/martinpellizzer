                <h1>Adhatoda matammensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda matammensis, commonly known as the Madras neem or Indian banyan, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Adhatoda matammensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda matammensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, and they bloom during the rainy season, pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small,椭圆形 (elliptical) seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda matammensis is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka in India. It is also present in countries like Bangladesh and Nepal.</p>
<p>Adhatoda matammensis is well adapted to humid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda matammensis was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, often thriving in disturbed environments. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas as an ornamental and medicinal species. Its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
