                        <h1>Abies procera</h1>
<p>Abies procera, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The needles are long, flat, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the tree its common name. It produces cones that hang downward, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns, horsetails, and some clubmosses. Its subclass is Pinidae, which refers to a group of coniferous plants that includes various pine and fir species.</p>
<p>Its order is Pinales, which consists of coniferous plants such as pines, firs, and cedars, known for their needle-like leaves and cone-bearing reproduction. Its family is Pinaceae, commonly known as the pine family, which includes many coniferous trees with needle-like leaves and woody cones. Its genus is Abies, which includes species of fir trees, typically characterized by their flat, spruce-like needles and cone structures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies procera was mainly introduced to Denmark, FÃ¸royar, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden.</p>
<p>It is a species of fir tree native to North America, specifically the western United States and Canada. The introduction of Abies procera to these regions is likely due to ornamental horticulture or reforestation efforts. It has been documented growing in various habitats, including mountainous areas and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>However, its establishment and spread in these regions remain limited compared to its native range.</p>
