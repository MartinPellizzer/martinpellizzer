                <h1>Achras dissecta</h1>
<p>Achras dissecta, commonly known as the desert date or African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras dissecta has large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras dissecta is primarily native to the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, including countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, arid regions and is adapted to thrive in harsh desert conditions. This plant is often seen growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas where it can tolerate high salinity. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing minimal vegetation cover in these extreme environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with similar climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras dissecta was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of South America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was primarily brought for its ornamental value due to its unique, palm-like appearance and ability to thrive in tropical climates. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Its spread has been facilitated by its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to drought conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is currently found.</p>
