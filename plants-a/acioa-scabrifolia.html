                <h1>Acioa scabrifolia</h1>
<p>Acioa scabrifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved acioa, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa scabrifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, scabrous bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa scabrifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and humid environments with high biodiversity. This plant thrives in areas with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa scabrifolia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions and is commonly found in temperate and subtropical regions. The plant is often spread through seed dispersal by wind, water, or animals. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many regions where it is not native.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
