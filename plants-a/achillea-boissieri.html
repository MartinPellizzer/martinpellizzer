                <h1>Achillea boissieri</h1>
<p>Achillea boissieri, commonly known as the Armenian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, featuring finely divided, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their anti-inflammatory and astringent effects.</p>
<p>Achillea boissieri is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea boissieri has compound, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels of white to pale yellow petals, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea boissieri is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in Italy and Greece. It thrives in rocky, dry environments such as slopes and limestone areas, often growing in full sun. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea boissieri is a perennial plant known for its ornamental yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, only during prolonged dry periods. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea boissieri is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by attracting beneficial insects. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea boissieri contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
