                    <h1>Androsace imbricata</h1>
<p>Androsace imbricata, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, overlapping leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Androsace imbricata is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
