                <h1>Acmadenia marlothii</h1>
<p>Acmadenia marlothii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acmadenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in heathland and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acmadenia marlothii is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia marlothii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, tubular, and pinkish-red in color, arranged in clusters, blooming from late autumn to early spring, and are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia marlothii is primarily native to southern Australia, specifically the states of South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, heathlands, and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with the flora of the Sydney Basin and the western regions of South Australia.</p>
<p>Acmadenia marlothii is an important component of the native vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia marlothii was mainly introduced to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape region, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous environments. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, posing a threat to native vegetation.</p>
