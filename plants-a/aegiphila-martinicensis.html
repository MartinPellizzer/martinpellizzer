                <h1>Aegiphila martinicensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique boxwood, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Martinique and Guadeloupe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches.</p>
<p>Aegiphila martinicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila martinicensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are glossy green on top and pale underneath, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>
