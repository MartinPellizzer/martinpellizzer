<p>Actiniopteris pauciloba, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
