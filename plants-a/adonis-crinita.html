                <h1>Adonis crinita</h1>
<p>Adonis crinita, commonly known as the hair-pinioned adonis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Adonis crinita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis crinita has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and smooth, with a pale green color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are yellow, with a distinctive crown-like structure, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis crinita is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral, grasslands, and woodland edges. This species thrives in regions with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often seen growing on rocky soils and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Adonis crinita is also known as the "Crown of Thorns" due to its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis crinita was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and disturbed forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in California, Oregon, and Nevada. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
