<p>Adiantum betulinum, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a delicate fern species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum betulinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
