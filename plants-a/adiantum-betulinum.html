                <h1>Adiantum betulinum</h1>
<p>Adiantum betulinum, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a delicate fern species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum betulinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum betulinum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 10â€“30 cm long, with a light green color and a slightly serrated edge. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, shrub-like pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit develops into a cluster of tiny, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum betulinum is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. This fern thrives in shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with mixed hardwood forests and is a common sight in the Southeastern states.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from Pennsylvania to Georgia and westward into Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum betulinum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States, as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid spread is attributed to its ability to form dense colonies and reproduce through spores.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
