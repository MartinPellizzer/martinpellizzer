<p>Abies concolor f. aurea, commonly known as the white fir with golden foliage, is a variant of the white fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>This coniferous tree is characterized by its striking golden-yellow needles, which contrast sharply with its silver-blue bark. The plant exhibits a pyramidal shape with a broad, spreading crown, typical of many fir species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The golden foliage makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
