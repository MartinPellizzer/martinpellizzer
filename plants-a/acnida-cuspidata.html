                <h1>Acnida cuspidata</h1>
<p>Acnida cuspidata, commonly known as the prickly acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, showcasing adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it has sharp, spiny structures that provide defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida cuspidata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a straight, upright pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida cuspidata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. The plant is commonly found in dense forests and along riverbanks, where it benefits from the moist and warm climate. It is often associated with secondary growth habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native range has been reduced, making conservation efforts increasingly important.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida cuspidata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in temperate climates, particularly in parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
