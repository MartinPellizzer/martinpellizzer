<p>Agrostis alba subsp.</p>
<p>salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh, salty conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to tolerate high soil salinity and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal plains. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that release lightweight seeds, facilitating wind dispersal in its natural habitat.</p>
