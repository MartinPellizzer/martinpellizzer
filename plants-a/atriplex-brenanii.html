<p>Atriplex brenanii, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Atriplex brenanii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
