                <h1>Acer leipoense</h1>
<p>Acer leipoense, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters with a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed, often with five to seven divisions, and turn bright red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer leipoense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer leipoense is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to fragmented habitats in these areas. It thrives in moist, temperate forests with well-drained soils and is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Acer leipoense is classified as endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer leipoense is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy and cuttings rooted in a humid, shaded environment. The growth cycle of Acer leipoense includes a period of rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer leipoense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and serves as a valuable nectar source. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer leipoense contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer leipoense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it does not have significant commercial uses. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in traditional Chinese practices and landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role is ecological and aesthetic, making it a valuable addition to natural habitats and urban green spaces.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer leipoense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Queen' and 'Autumn Flame,' which are known for their vibrant fall colors. Hybrids of Acer leipoense are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance and growth form. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and parks for their visual impact throughout the growing season.</p>
