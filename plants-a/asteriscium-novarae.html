<p>Asteriscium novarae, commonly known as the Novara asterisk, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asteriscium novarae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
