                <h1>Achillea magna var. alpina</h1>
<p>Achillea magna var. alpina, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, gray-green stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea magna var. alpina has narrow, linear leaves that are blue-green in color, with a slightly hairy texture, arranged in a basal rosette and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of pale yellow to white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea magna var. alpina is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and northern Spain, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. This variety prefers open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows, slopes, and rocky outcrops. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The species is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though it is sensitive to habitat disturbance and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea magna var. alpina is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and requires moderate watering.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in the fall. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with new growth emerging in early spring and flowering in summer. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other alpine plants like sedum and矾根.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea magna var. alpina is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its dense foliage and aromatic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it effective in stabilizing slopes and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea magna var. alpina is a flowering plant commonly found in alpine regions, known for its medicinal properties.</p>
