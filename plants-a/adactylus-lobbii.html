                <h1>Adactylus lobbii</h1>
<p>Adactylus lobbii, commonly known as the African orchid bee, is a species of bee native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is a solitary bee that plays a role in pollination, particularly for orchids and other flowering plants. The male Adactylus lobbii is known for its distinctive black body with bright yellow markings on its face and thorax. Unlike honeybees, it does not produce honey but is important for plant reproduction.</p>
<p>Its behavior and morphology make it a unique subject of study in entomology and plant ecology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adactylus lobbii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adactylus lobbii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the humid forests of the northeastern region. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adactylus lobbii was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, gardens, and urban areas. The plant has shown rapid spread in regions with warm climates and low precipitation. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
