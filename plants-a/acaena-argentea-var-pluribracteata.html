                        <h1>Acaena argentea var. pluribracteata</h1>
<p>Acaena argentea var. pluribracteata, commonly known as the silverweed or silver cushion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that appear in early spring, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora and a subject of ecological study.</p>
