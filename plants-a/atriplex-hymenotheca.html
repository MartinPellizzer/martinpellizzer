                    <h1>Atriplex hymenotheca</h1>
<p>Atriplex hymenotheca, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex hymenotheca plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
