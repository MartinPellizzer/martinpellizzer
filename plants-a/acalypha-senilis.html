                        <h1>Acalypha senilis</h1>
<p>Acalypha senilis, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha senilis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique leaf coloration.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha senilis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with distinctive floral and vegetative features. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and some toxic properties. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy bracts and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha senilis, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha senilis is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil West-Central, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along streambanks. Acalypha senilis is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the humid climates of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha senilis was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport on vehicles or cargo. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland habitats across the islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it poses a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
