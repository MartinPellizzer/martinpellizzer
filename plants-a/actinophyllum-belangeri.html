                <h1>Actinophyllum belangeri</h1>
<p>Actinophyllum belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's actinophyllum, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>Actinophyllum belangeri is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum belangeri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, pale green bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchoring, helping the plant to stabilize in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum belangeri is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland sandplains. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. It is a low-growing shrub that is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum belangeri was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout the country. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed habitats. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution continues to expand, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
