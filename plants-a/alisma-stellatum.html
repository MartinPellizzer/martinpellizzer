                    <h1>Alisma stellatum</h1>
<p>Alisma stellatum, commonly known as star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize wet soil environments.</p>
<p>Alisma stellatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
