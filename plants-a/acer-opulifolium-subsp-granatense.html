                <h1>Acer opulifolium subsp. granatense</h1>
<p>Acer opulifolium subsp.</p>
<p>granatense, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, and are bright green during the growing season. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium subsp.</p>
<p>granatense has leaves that are ovate to broadly ovate, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length; they are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a multi-branched structure.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in upright panicles, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium subsp.</p>
<p>granatense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern and southeastern Europe, particularly in parts of Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia. Its current distribution is limited to specific high-altitude areas within these regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is typically found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, often growing at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium subsp.</p>
<p>granatense is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique foliage structure. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 10 to 15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium subsp.</p>
<p>granatense is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in native plant gardens, enhancing the health of surrounding vegetation. The plant also helps with erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium subsp.</p>
<p>granatense is a lesser-known maple species with limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits. It has been traditionally used in some indigenous medicinal practices for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>While it lacks significant industrial or economic value, it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife. Culturally, it may hold symbolic meaning in certain regions where it is native.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more common maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium subsp.</p>
<p>granatense has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Cloud' and 'Coral焰', which display striking red foliage. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer rubrum, to produce cultivars with enhanced growth habits and coloration.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more vibrant fall colors, making them popular choices for gardeners. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>Its versatility in landscaping makes it an important addition to the horticultural palette.</p>
