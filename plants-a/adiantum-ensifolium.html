                <h1>Adiantum ensifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum ensifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Adiantum ensifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum ensifolium has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows from a rhizome. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ensifolium is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forests and along stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with limestone soils. It is also present in parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Adiantum ensifolium is well adapted to wetland habitats and is sometimes found in swampy areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ensifolium was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural habitats, though it is generally considered non-invasive.</p>
