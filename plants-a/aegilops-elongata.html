                <h1>Aegilops elongata</h1>
<p>Aegilops elongata, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale green to brown florets. Aegilops elongata is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential agricultural uses and genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops elongata has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth, slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-angled, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
