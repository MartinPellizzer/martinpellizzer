<p>Aspidium conjugatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, ponds, or in damp forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Aspidium conjugatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland habitats.</p>
