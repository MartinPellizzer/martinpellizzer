<p>Acalypha eremorum var. capillipeda, commonly known as the silky acalypha, is a shrub native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are often followed by distinctive, papery bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
