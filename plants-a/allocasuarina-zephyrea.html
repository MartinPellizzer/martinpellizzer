<p>Allocasuarina zephyrea, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive feathery, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones, which mature and release seeds in response to fire, aiding in regeneration.</p>
<p>Allocasuarina zephyrea is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands.</p>
