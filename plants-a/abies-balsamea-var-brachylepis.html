                    <h1>Abies balsamea var. brachylepis</h1>
<p>Abies balsamea var. brachylepis, commonly known as the dwarf balsam fir, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, pyramidal growth habit and dense foliage of dark green needles. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its leaves are typically shorter and more rigid compared to the standard balsam fir, giving it a more compact appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a specimen plant in shaded woodland settings.</p>
