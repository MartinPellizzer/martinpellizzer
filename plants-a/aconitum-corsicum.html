                <h1>Aconitum corsicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum corsicum, commonly known as Corsican aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum corsicum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum corsicum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically large, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark with a somewhat fibrous texture. Its flowers are blue to purple, borne in dense spikes, and consist of 5 sepals and 5 petals, blooming from July to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for absorbing water and nutrients from the rocky soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum corsicum is primarily native to Corsica.</p>
<p>It is found in the wild across various regions of the island, particularly in mountainous and alpine areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species to Corsica.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum corsicum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various regions. The plant spreads through its rhizomes and seeds, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
