                <h1>Achyrospermum phlomoides</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum phlomoides, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and appearance make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum phlomoides has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, typically a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth, light green bark that has a slight fibrous texture. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with tubular corollas that are pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum phlomoides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open grasslands, savannas, and along roadsides in these areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to regions with warm climates and low to moderate rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum phlomoides was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadsides, wastelands, and other degraded areas where it thrives in full sun. The plant has adapted well to various soil types and can tolerate drought conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an effective pioneer species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent it from outcompeting native flora.</p>
