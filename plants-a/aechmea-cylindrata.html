                <h1>Aechmea cylindrata</h1>
<p>Aechmea cylindrata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a velvety texture. It produces showy inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea cylindrata has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick, and fibrous base that resembles a pseudostem. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with white to pinkish petals, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a berry-like structure that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its natural habitat.</p>
