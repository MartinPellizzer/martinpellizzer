                <h1>Acer elegantulum</h1>
<p>Acer elegantulum, commonly known as the elegant maple, is a small deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 5-10 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 3–6 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip; they are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in upright clusters, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in several botanical gardens and private collections around the world. This plant thrives in humid, temperate climates and is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. It grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer elegantulum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer elegantulum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials enhances its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and supporting microbial activity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum is a rare and ornamental plant primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may be occasionally used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though its use remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance, supporting local wildlife and soil health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in certain regions, inspiring art and botanical interest.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' with its golden foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring variegated leaves. Hybrids such as Acer × carpinifolium and Acer × sibiricum are often derived from crosses with other maple species. These cultivars and hybrids are significant in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Their use in landscaping highlights the plant's importance in garden design and urban forestry.</p>
