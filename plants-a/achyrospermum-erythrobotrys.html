                <h1>Achyrospermum erythrobotrys</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum erythrobotrys, commonly known as the red-stemmed false nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, lobed leaves, and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows as an annual or perennial herb and thrives in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum erythrobotrys has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually light green on top and slightly hairy underneath, with a moderate size and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing upright with branching. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
