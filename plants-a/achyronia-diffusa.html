                <h1>Achyronia diffusa</h1>
<p>Achyronia diffusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. It is native to regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in many areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia diffusa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length and 1 to 2 cm in width.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia diffusa is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Mexico, including the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and sandy soils. It is commonly associated with disturbed areas and can often be found along roadsides and in arid regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the southwestern and southern regions of the United States and northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia diffusa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often due to human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common weed in cultivated fields and along roadsides. The plant spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its rapid colonization of new areas. Its introduction has led to competition with native species, sometimes altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, Achyronia diffusa is also used in some regions for medicinal purposes.</p>
