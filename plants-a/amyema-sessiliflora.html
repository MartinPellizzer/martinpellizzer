<p>Amyema sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts, through a specialized root system called a haustellum. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow,革质 (leathery), and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Amyema sessiliflora plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native birds and insects.</p>
