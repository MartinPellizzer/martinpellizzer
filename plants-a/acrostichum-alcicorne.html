                <h1>Acrostichum alcicorne</h1>
<p>Acrostichum alcicorne, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproduction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alcicorne has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows vertically. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alcicorne is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, often near rivers and in swampy or wetland environments. This plant thrives in warm, moist climates and is typically associated with mangrove ecosystems or coastal forests. Its native range includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Acrostichum alcicorne is an important species for both ecological and possibly traditional uses in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alcicorne was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in wetland or swampy environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and poor drainage, such as tropical and subtropical wetlands. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly in such conditions. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a invasive species in non-native areas.</p>
