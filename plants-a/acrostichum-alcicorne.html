                    <h1>Acrostichum alcicorne</h1>
<p>Acrostichum alcicorne, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproduction.</p>
