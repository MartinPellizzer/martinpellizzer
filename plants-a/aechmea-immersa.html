                <h1>Aechmea immersa</h1>
<p>Aechmea immersa, commonly known as the water pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool capable of holding water, which is used by various wildlife species. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Aechmea immersa thrives in humid environments and is often found growing in shaded, moist areas such as forests and wetlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea immersa has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a compact circle, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, underground rhizome that supports its growth. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with small white to yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
