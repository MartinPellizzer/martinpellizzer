                        <h1>Acaena × metaphyllidion</h1>
<p>Acaena × metaphyllidion, commonly known as the hybrid New Zealand brake, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red or orange berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Acaena × metaphyllidion is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena × metaphyllidion is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Acaena crassipes and Acaena metaplyxia. This plant is commonly found in the northern and central regions of New Zealand's North Island. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where its parent species overlap.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena × metaphyllidion was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of horticultural and ornamental plant collections.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena crassula and Acaena metathera. This plant is commonly found in cultivated gardens and along roadsides in the region. Due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it has occasionally spread beyond its intended planting areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
