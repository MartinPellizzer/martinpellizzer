                    <h1>Anthyllis tenuicaulis</h1>
<p>Anthyllis tenuicaulis, commonly known as narrow-stemmed broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its slender, upright stems are covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
