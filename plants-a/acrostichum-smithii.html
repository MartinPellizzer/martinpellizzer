                <h1>Acrostichum smithii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum smithii, commonly known as the Smith's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, fan-like appearance that gives it a tropical appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum smithii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its dense, foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum smithii has large, feather-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a pinnate arrangement and a width of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stems are upright and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops ridges as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum smithii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland wetlands, where it thrives in moist, saline environments. This plant is often associated with mangrove forests and salt marshes, adapting well to brackish water conditions. Its distribution is limited to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Acrostichum smithii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum smithii was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of Southeast Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps and estuaries. This plant has been reported in several regions including the Gold Coast, Tweed River, and the Burnett River catchment. Its introduction is believed to be due to human activities, including the dumping of garden waste and accidental transport via waterways.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential invasive species in these ecosystems.</p>
