                <h1>Acrostichum rufidulum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rufidulum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rufidulum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure between 30 to 50 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plantâ€™s growth. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively through underground runners.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rufidulum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This fern thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full shade. Its native range extends from southern Mexico through Brazil, Argentina, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is often associated with swampy and seasonally flooded habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rufidulum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have made it a common invader in some ecosystems. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
