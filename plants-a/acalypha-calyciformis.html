<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble coral, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and typically have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acalypha calyciformis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha calyciformis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a bright green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow stamens and pale green petals, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a蒴果 (capsule) containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha calyciformis is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Although it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, particularly in warm climates with suitable soil conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest understories or along stream banks. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acalypha calyciformis is currently listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
