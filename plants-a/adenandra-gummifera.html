                <h1>Adenandra gummifera</h1>
<p>Adenandra gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or yellow adenandra, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and has been used traditionally for various purposes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments.</p>
<p>The tree is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra gummifera has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 3 to 8 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra gummifera is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the fynbos vegetation of this region. The plant thrives in coastal and mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastlines.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is limited to specific areas within the Cape Provinces of South Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra gummifera was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was brought during the 19th century by European settlers who sought to introduce exotic flora to their gardens. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
