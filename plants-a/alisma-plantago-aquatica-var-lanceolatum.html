                    <h1>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. lanceolatum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emerge from the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to wetland ecosystem stability.</p>
