<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>macrophylla, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its dense,丛生的 growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in tight, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are linear and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid, coastal habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
