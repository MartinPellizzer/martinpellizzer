<p>Asplenium virillae, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense mats. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium virillae is a hardy species that is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
