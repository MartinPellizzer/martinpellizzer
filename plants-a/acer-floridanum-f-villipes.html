                    <h1>Acer floridanum f. villipes</h1>
<p>Acer floridanum f. villipes, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
