<p>Allium wierzbickii, commonly known as the Wierzbicki garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
