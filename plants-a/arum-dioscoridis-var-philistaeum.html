<p>Arum dioscoridis var. philistaeum, commonly known as the Philistine arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a robust underground rhizome and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a prominent midrib. The plant bears inflorescences composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats.</p>
<p>While it is primarily ornamental, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
