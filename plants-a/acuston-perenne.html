                <h1>Acuston perenne</h1>
<p>Acuston perenne, commonly known as the everlasting grass, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that produce small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. It is often cultivated for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to drought.</p>
<p>Acuston perenne is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a ground cover in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuston perenne has leaves that are oval-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright and branching moderately. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

It is typically found in rocky or coastal areas, where it adapts well to the harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuston perenne was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions where the climate supports its growth cycle. This plant has been introduced to several regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It thrives in gardens and landscaped areas, often used as a ground cover or in mixed borders.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from spreading beyond intended planting areas.</p>
