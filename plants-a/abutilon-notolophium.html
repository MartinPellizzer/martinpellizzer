<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon notolophium has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are pendulous, with five petals and stamens, displaying a yellowish-orange color, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon notolophium is a shrub native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in the central and southern parts of the island, particularly in limestone areas. The plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing in coastal and inland cliffs. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
