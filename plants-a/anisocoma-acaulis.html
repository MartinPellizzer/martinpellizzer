<p>Anisocoma acaulis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with a distinctive rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to drought and high temperatures make it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects in dry landscapes.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
