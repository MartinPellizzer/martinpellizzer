                    <h1>Acacia pruinescens</h1>
<p>Acacia pruinescens, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are narrow, linear, and covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in the Acacia genus to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia pruinescens is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
