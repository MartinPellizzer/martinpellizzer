                    <h1>Anidrum transitoria</h1>
<p>Anidrum transitoria, commonly known as the temporary bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. This plant is typically found in temporary pools and wetlands, where it can quickly colonize new areas before the water dries up. Its leaves are usually filamentous and lack true roots, adapting to its ephemeral habitat.</p>
<p>Anidrum transitoria plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
