                <h1>Acianthella heptadactyla</h1>
<p>Acianthella heptadactyla, commonly known as the seven-fingered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. The plant is characterized by its unique, finger-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acianthella heptadactyla is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthella heptadactyla has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, greyish bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthella heptadactyla is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically from New South Wales to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal heathlands and sand dune ecosystems. This species thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often associated with coastal vegetation. It is a small shrub that plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthella heptadactyla was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, where it has established itself in disturbed and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high sunlight exposure and moderate to low rainfall. This plant is often associated with human-modified landscapes such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native flora in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains a subject of study for its ecological impact and adaptability.</p>
