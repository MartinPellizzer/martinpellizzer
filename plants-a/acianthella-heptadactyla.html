<p>Acianthella heptadactyla, commonly known as the seven-fingered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. The plant is characterized by its unique, finger-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acianthella heptadactyla is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
