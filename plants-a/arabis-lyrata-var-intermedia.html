                    <h1>Arabis lyrata var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Arabis lyrata var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
