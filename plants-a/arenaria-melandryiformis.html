                    <h1>Arenaria melandryiformis</h1>
<p>Arenaria melandryiformis, commonly known as the sandstone sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and dry meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, sun-exposed habitats.</p>
