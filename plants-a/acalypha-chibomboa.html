<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red stems and yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha chibomboa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, with a pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with bright red bracts that resemble petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed蒴果 (capsule) containing small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it to absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
