                <h1>Aconitum lasianthum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lasianthum, commonly known as the blue aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasianthum has large, palmately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a broad, spreading arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rough to the touch, and has a bluish-green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple, with spurred petals and are arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasianthum is primarily native to Romania.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in mountainous areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution in Romania highlights its ecological significance in local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasianthum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the northeastern United States. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it adaptable to a variety of habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread aggressively and compete with native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
