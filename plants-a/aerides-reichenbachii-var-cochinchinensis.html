The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
