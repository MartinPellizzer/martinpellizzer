<p>Alsine vulgaris, commonly known as common alsike, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Alsine vulgaris is known for its ability to colonize areas quickly, making it both a weed and a potential indicator of soil conditions.</p>
