                    <h1>Acanthophyllum allochrusoides</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum allochrusoides, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with dense, spiny foliage that helps reduce water loss and protect against wind erosion. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh desert environments and plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
