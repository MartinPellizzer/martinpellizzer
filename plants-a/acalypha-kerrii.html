<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that range in color from red to orange, often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acalypha kerrii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha kerrii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and their relatives, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large and diverse group of flowering plants that includes many species with unique adaptations such as sticky seeds. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha kerrii, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, native to certain regions and distinguished by its unique morphological and ecological characteristics.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha kerrii is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha kerrii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its establishment in some non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
