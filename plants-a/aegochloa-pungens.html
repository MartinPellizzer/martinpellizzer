                    <h1>Aegochloa pungens</h1>
<p>Aegochloa pungens, commonly known as purple moonglade grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple to violet-colored foliage, which becomes more intense under full sun exposure. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Aegochloa pungens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
