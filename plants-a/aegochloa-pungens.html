                <h1>Aegochloa pungens</h1>
<p>Aegochloa pungens, commonly known as purple moonglade grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple to violet-colored foliage, which becomes more intense under full sun exposure. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Aegochloa pungens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegochloa pungens has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 20 to 40 centimeters in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and forms dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically greenish in color and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind, allowing the plant to spread across open areas.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to stabilize itself and propagate vegetatively.</p>
