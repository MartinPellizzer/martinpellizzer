<p>[WRONG START] Arisaema murrayi var. sivadasananii, commonly known as the Sivadasanii cormflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like inflorescence that consists of a central spadix surrounded by a broad, white spathe. The plant produces a single corm-like tuber that serves as its storage organ and is crucial for its survival. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
