                <h1>Adenosacme malayana</h1>
<p>Adenosacme malayana, commonly known as the Malay starfruit, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a bright orange color, often containing several seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme malayana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in spikes, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind due to their lack of showy petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme malayana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and shaded undergrowth in these regions. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high levels of rainfall. It is often associated with primary and secondary forest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme malayana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasive characteristics in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond controlled areas.</p>
