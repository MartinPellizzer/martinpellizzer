                    <h1>Asplenium squamosum</h1>
<p>Asplenium squamosum, commonly known as the scaly spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with minute, scale-like structures. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or forested habitats. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium squamosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
