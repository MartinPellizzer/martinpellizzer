<p>Aristolochia westlandii, commonly known as the Westland Dutchman's pipe, is a tropical climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The plant produces small, green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions, though it requires careful handling due to its toxic nature.</p>
