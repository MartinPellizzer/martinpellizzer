<p>Arceuthobium hondurense subsp.</p>
<p>hondurense, commonly known as the Honduran dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>The species is native to Central America, particularly Honduras, and is adapted to grow in dry, arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are inconspicuous and rarely seen, as the plant spends most of its life underground.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
