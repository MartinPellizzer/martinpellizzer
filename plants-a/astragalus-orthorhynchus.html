                    <h1>Astragalus orthorhynchus</h1>
<p>Astragalus orthorhynchus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus orthorhynchus is also a member of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
