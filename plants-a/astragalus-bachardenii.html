<p>Astragalus bachardenii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow to greenish-yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface.</p>
<p>Astragalus bachardenii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
