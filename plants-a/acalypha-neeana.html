                <h1>Acalypha neeana</h1>
<p>Acalypha neeana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-hot catshrub, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by three-lobed seed capsules.</p>
<p>Acalypha neeana is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha neeana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha neeana is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in specific regions of the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern rainforests. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of rainfall. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acalypha neeana is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha neeana is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage branching.
