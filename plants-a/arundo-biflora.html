                    <h1>Arundo biflora</h1>
<p>Arundo biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to wetland environments and thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both an ecological pioneer and a potential invasive species.</p>
<p>Arundo biflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
