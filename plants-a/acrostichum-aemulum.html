                <h1>Acrostichum aemulum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum aemulum, commonly known as the common brake, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aemulum has large, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dark, spherical drupe containing one or two seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aemulum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, moist soil, often in areas with partial to full shade. Its distribution includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands, extending its native range to include parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aemulum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along waterways where it can thrive in moist, saline environments. This plant has been reported in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, where it often competes with native vegetation. Its introduction is largely due to human activities such as land development and the movement of soil or water.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
