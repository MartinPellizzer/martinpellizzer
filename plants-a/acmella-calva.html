                <h1>Acmella calva</h1>
<p>Acmella calva, commonly known as the spiny false shamrock, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Acmella calva is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella calva has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish with a distinctive white center, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella calva is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, China South-Central, East Himalaya, India, Jawa, Lesser Sunda Is., Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or near water bodies. It is widely distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its native range includes diverse habitats such as wetlands, riverbanks, and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella calva was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores of New South Wales and Queensland. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as dunes and coastal vegetation. It has been reported in several conservation areas, raising concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Its spread is believed to be facilitated by human activity and coastal development.</p>
