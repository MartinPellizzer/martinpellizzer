                <h1>Aegopodium carum</h1>
<p>Aegopodium carum, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a bushy growth habit with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it useful in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium carum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring approximately 1â€“2 cm in length, and having a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a light green color and a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom from June to August, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
