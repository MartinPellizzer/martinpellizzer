                    <h1>Adelanthus</h1>
<p>Adelanthus, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of succulent plants belonging to the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their fleshy, often thick leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Adelanthus species typically have a compact growth habit and produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. They are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and are well adapted to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to their hardiness and ornamental value, many Adelanthus species are cultivated as decorative plants in gardens and rockeries.</p>
