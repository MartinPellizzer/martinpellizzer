                <h1>Adinandra cordifolia</h1>
<p>Adinandra cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved adinandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its attractive, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Adinandra cordifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra cordifolia has leaves that are heart-shaped (cordate), arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra cordifolia is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra cordifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests, moist mountain forests, and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive, heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in new environments, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
