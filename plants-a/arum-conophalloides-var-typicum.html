<p>Arum conophalloides var. typicum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features a large, heart-shaped leaf with a distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaf sheath, which gives it its common name. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of small flowers surrounded by a showy, spatulate spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates.</p>
