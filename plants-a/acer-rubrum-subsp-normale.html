                <h1>Acer rubrum subsp. normale</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>normale, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grey when young, becoming furrowed with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>normale has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a coarsely toothed margin and a vibrant green color that turns brilliant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in pendulous racemes, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light, aiding in their spread.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>normale is a North American species native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. Its current distribution includes parts of New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the southeastern U.S., where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies prefers full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in mixed hardwood forests, stream valleys, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, habitat loss and urban development have led to localized declines, prompting conservation efforts in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>normale is a species of maple known for its vibrant red foliage and adaptability to various environments. It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination.
