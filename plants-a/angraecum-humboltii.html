                    <h1>Angraecum humboltii</h1>
<p>Angraecum humboltii, commonly known as the Humboldt orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing fragrant, white to pale blue flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths, highlighting its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
