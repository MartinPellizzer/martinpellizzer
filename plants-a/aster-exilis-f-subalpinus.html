The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
