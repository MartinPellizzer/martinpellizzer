                <h1>Aechmea aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Aechmea aurantiaca, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliad family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that resemble a pineapple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to adapt to various light conditions, making it relatively easy to care for.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea aurantiaca has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and leathery, arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish hue on the underside, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, thick stem that is covered in a dense, fibrous sheath, and it grows primarily from the base rather than branching extensively. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, often in shades of red or orange, and they bloom during the warmer months, pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through wind dispersal, and its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
