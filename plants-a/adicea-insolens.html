<p>Adicea insolens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, translucent leaves and elongated, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Adicea insolens is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered critically endangered.</p>
