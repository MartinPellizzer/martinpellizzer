<p>Aspalathus tridentata subsp.</p>
<p>rotunda, commonly known as the rooibos bush, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its most notable feature is the unique shape of its leaves, which are rounded and slightly heart-shaped.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to the commercially important Aspalathus linearis, from which rooibos tea is derived.</p>
