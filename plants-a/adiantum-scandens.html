                <h1>Adiantum scandens</h1>
<p>Adiantum scandens, commonly known as the climbing maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a lacy appearance. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of climbing, allowing it to ascend trees and other structures.</p>
<p>Adiantum scandens prefers shady, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum scandens has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with narrow, linear lobes that are bright green and often have a silvery-white margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and are wind-pollinated during the spring months. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor it to surfaces, often growing on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scandens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its natural range extends to the Philippines and Indonesia as well.</p>
<p>It is a climbing fern that plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scandens was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. It spreads through spores and can establish itself in natural habitats where conditions are favorable.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
