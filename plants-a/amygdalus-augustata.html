<p>Amygdalus augustata, commonly known as the desert almond, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces fragrant white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible almonds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>The fruit contains a single seed, which is the edible part of the plant.</p>
