                <h1>Acrocentron tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Acrocentron tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed acrocentron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocentron tenuifolium has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron tenuifolium is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is often seen growing in open woodlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron tenuifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in temperate and subtropical zones. The plant is often found growing alongside other shade-tolerant species, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, particularly in parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native flora remains largely understudied.</p>
