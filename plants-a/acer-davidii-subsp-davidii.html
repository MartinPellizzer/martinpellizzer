                <h1>Acer davidii subsp. davidii</h1>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>davidii, commonly known as the David maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and structural form.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>davidii has palmately compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with 5-7 leaflets that are ovate to elliptical in shape, ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length. The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>davidii is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and overexploitation.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate forests with high humidity and moderate temperatures, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activities, it is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>davidii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth. It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer or through seed sown in a cold stratification process. The growth cycle of this plant is slow, with a dormant period in winter and active growth during spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is recommended, along with light pruning to maintain shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or heathers can enhance its garden appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>davidii is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing overall ecosystem stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, particularly on slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>davidii is a rare and ornamental maple species primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscaping. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
<p>The wood of this species is not widely used industrially due to its limited availability and hard-to-work characteristics. Culturally, it holds significance in regions of its native habitat, often symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its conservation status also makes it an important species for ecological studies and biodiversity preservation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>davidii has a number of popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Aureum' with its golden foliage and 'Variegatum' known for its striking variegated leaves. It also serves as a parent in several hybrids, such as the popular 'Dissectum' and 'Red Sunset', which combine the hardiness of Acer davidii with the vibrant colors of other maple species.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to a range of garden conditions. Their unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes make them a favorite among landscape designers and garden enthusiasts. Overall, Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>davidii plays a significant role in the horticultural world due to its contribution to the diversity and beauty of cultivated maples.</p>
