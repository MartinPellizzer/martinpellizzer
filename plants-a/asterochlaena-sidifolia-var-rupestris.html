                    <h1>Asterochlaena sidifolia var. rupestris</h1>
<p>Asterochlaena sidifolia var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock aster, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
