                <h1>Acronema gracile</h1>
<p>Acronema gracile, commonly known as the slender acronema, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice among gardeners in Mediterranean climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema gracile has small, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure that relies on wind pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema gracile is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of this area. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments typical of Tibet's high-altitude terrain. It is often seen growing on slopes and in meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Tibet due to the harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema gracile was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. This plant has shown adaptability to various soil types, contributing to its spread in non-native regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>As a result, it is now considered an invasive species in several areas outside its native range.</p>
