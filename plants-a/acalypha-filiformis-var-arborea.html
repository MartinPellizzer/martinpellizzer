                    <h1>Acalypha filiformis var. arborea</h1>
<p>Acalypha filiformis var. arborea, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxic properties, but it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
