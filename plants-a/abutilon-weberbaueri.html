                <h1>Abutilon weberbaueri</h1>
<p>Abutilon weberbaueri, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance, while its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Abutilon weberbaueri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon weberbaueri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are pendulous, with five lobes, typically yellow or orange in color, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and allowing the plant to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon weberbaueri is a species native to the western Andes of South America, specifically in countries such as Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, with limited introduction outside of its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon weberbaueri is a fast-growing, ornamental plant known for its vibrant, showy flowers and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. This plant thrives in warm, sunny conditions and has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, making it suitable for tropical or subtropical climates.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
