<p>Amaryllis bagnoldii, commonly known as the desert amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, showy inflorescences with large, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its bulb and entering dormancy during periods of drought. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a unique addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
<p>Amaryllis bagnoldii is prized for its vibrant blooms and resilience, though it requires careful cultivation to thrive.</p>
