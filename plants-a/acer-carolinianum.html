                <h1>Acer carolinianum</h1>
<p>Acer carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–25 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are palmately lobed, turning vibrant red and orange in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer carolinianum has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, displaying a vibrant green on top and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a rounded crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer carolinianum is a small, deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has been largely reduced due to habitat loss, with the species now primarily found in protected areas and conservation reserves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests and along stream banks, preferring a humid and temperate environment. Acer carolinianum is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, generally below 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer carolinianum is a small, deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, known for its ornamental value and shade tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by leaf drop in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of a balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood.</p>
<p>Common pests include scale insects and aphids, while diseases like verticillium wilt can affect it, making companion planting with drought-tolerant species beneficial for overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer carolinianum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its early spring flowers. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant, offering protection and habitat in mixed forests. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer carolinianum is a small deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and fruits have been historically used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions. The tree plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. In terms of cultural significance, it is sometimes used in landscaping and conservation efforts to enhance biodiversity.</p>
<p>Although it has limited industrial applications, its aesthetic appeal makes it a valuable addition to urban and rural environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer carolinianum has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, such as 'Cerevisiae' with its striking red foliage and 'Coral焰' known for its vibrant autumn colors.</p>
<p>It also has natural hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity within the genus. These cultivars and hybrids are often used in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in shaded areas and its contribution to landscape design.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a valuable addition to both public and private gardens.</p>
