                <h1>Acmella ciliata</h1>
<p>Acmella ciliata, commonly known as the spurred sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has finely toothed, hairy leaves and grows up to 1 meter in height. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella ciliata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, exhibiting a vibrant green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish with a distinctive central white spot, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella ciliata is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and North America, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, often in areas with high moisture levels. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its conservation status remains uncertain due to limited research and potential habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella ciliata is a flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow-orange flowers and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method offering faster results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages more blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>
