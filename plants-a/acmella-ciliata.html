                <h1>Acmella ciliata</h1>
<p>Acmella ciliata, commonly known as the spiny cress, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers and its hairy, spiny stems and leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acmella ciliata is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella ciliata has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in spikes, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella ciliata is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Panam√°, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Acmella ciliata is often associated with rich, organic soils in its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella ciliata was mainly introduced to India, Malaya, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Taiwan, Thailand.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant species that has been documented in these regions, likely due to its ornamental or medicinal value. The plant is native to South America but has been cultivated in these tropical and subtropical areas. Its introduction may have occurred through horticultural trade or accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact in these regions remains largely unstudied.</p>
