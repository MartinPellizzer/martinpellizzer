                <h1>Acianthera aurantiolateritia</h1>
<p>Acianthera aurantiolateritia, commonly known as the golden-laterally striped orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange and yellow floral patterns, which are prominently displayed on the lateral petals. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>The orchid's roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera aurantiolateritia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, pale green bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a striking orange-red color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera aurantiolateritia is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Rondônia. This plant thrives in the humid tropical rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera aurantiolateritia was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. This plant has shown a high capacity for adaptation, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological effects.</p>
