                    <h1>Amygdalus × vavilovii f. amara</h1>
<p>Amygdalus × vavilovii f. amara, commonly known as the wild almond hybrid, is a botanical species that exhibits characteristics of both Prunus dulcis (sweet almond) and Prunus amygdalus var. amara (bitter almond).</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid that thrives in temperate climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain hard, bitter seeds, which are not typically used for culinary purposes. Its genetic makeup makes it a valuable subject in botanical research, especially in the study of almond domestication and genetic diversity.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ornamental value, with attractive spring blossoms that add aesthetic appeal to gardens.</p>
