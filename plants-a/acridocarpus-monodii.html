<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Its essential oil, derived from the heartwood, is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in perfumery, traditional medicine, and incense.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<p>It is found in the savanna regions of this country. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of western Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus monodii was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and degraded forests. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. Its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities contribute to its successful establishment in these regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
