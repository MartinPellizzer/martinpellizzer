<p>Arenaria lithops, commonly known as the livestone moss or the living stone, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, aiding in camouflage within its arid habitat. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly environments. Its flowers, typically small and yellow or white, appear in spring and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
