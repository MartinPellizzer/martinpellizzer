<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to high-altitude conditions and cold climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium frigidum var. geblerianum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly associated with arid and semi-arid regions. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological conditions that support its growth in these remote and rugged areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
