                <h1>Acrostichum cardiophyllum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heart-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its fronds are compound, with multiple leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern.</p>
<p>Acrostichum cardiophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cardiophyllum has large, feather-like leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and range from 30 to 60 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows in a branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cardiophyllum is primarily native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, including Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salt exposure. This plant is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cardiophyllum was mainly introduced to new environments due to its adaptability and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, construction sites, and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in moist, tropical conditions and can tolerate a variety of soil types. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impact.</p>
