                <h1>Adenanthera gilletii</h1>
<p>Adenanthera gilletii, commonly known as the African burr or ironwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that can remain on the plant for years, dispersing when the pods dry and split open.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used traditionally for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera gilletii has leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown color and a vertical growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with lateral branches, aiding in water absorption from deep soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera gilletii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. This plant is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. It thrives in areas with warm climates and seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>Adenanthera gilletii is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera gilletii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, quarries, and riverbanks. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its introduction has led to its spread beyond its original range, contributing to local vegetation changes.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in the regions where it has been introduced.</p>
