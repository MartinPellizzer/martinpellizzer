<p>Aspidium triangulum subsp.</p>
<p>rhizophorum, commonly known as the rhizophorous water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid habitats.</p>
