                    <h1>Asarca lechleri</h1>
<p>Asarca lechleri, commonly known as *dragon's blood tree*, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense canopy of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces a dark red resin, often referred to as "dragon's blood," which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a dye. This resin is collected by making incisions in the bark, leading to the exudation of the sticky substance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, lowland tropical environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
