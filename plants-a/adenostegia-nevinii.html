                <h1>Adenostegia nevinii</h1>
<p>Adenostegia nevinii, commonly known as the Nevin's adenostegia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in the spring.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia nevinii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and they grow in a branching pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky environments where the plant is commonly found.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia nevinii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal scrub and chaparral habitats of southern California. This plant thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is commonly observed in regions such as San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties.</p>
<p>Adenostegia nevinii is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia nevinii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and dry climates.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
