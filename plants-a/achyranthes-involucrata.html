<p>Achyranthes involucrata, commonly known as the Indian knotgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and bracts that form a dense, spiky involucrum at the base of each inflorescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are lanceolate, hairy, and have a distinctive reddish or purplish tinge, especially when mature.</p>
<p>Achyranthes involucrata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes involucrata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and often branched, with a smooth, light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and have a greenish-white color, blooming from summer to autumn, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
