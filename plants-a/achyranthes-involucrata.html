                <h1>Achyranthes involucrata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes involucrata, commonly known as the Indian mallow or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Achyranthes involucrata is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes involucrata has simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy lower surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branched, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark with a somewhat woody texture. The flowers are small, clustered in loose panicles, with white or pale yellow petals, and bloom from spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes involucrata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed soils. It is also present in parts of southern Asia, including India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a warm, wet climate and adequate sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes involucrata was mainly introduced to disturbed soils and anthropogenic environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with poor soil quality and frequent human activity. This plant is commonly found along roadsides, in abandoned fields, and near urban developments. Its adaptability allows it to spread rapidly in these environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature.</p>
