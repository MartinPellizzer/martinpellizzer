                <h1>Acis ionica</h1>
<p>Acis ionica, commonly known as the Ionian acis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acis ionica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis ionica has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy texture and a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis ionica is primarily native to Albania and Greece.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these countries. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open woodland or grassland habitats. It is a perennial herb that is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within these two nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis ionica was mainly introduced to control invasive weeds in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in regions where its growth can suppress unwanted vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it an effective mulch and ground cover.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-target environments.</p>
