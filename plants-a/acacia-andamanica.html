                        <h1>Acacia andamanica</h1>
<p>Acacia andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia andamanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia andamanica is primarily native to the Andaman Islands, which are part of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests and coastal areas of these islands. It thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in both lowland and hill forest regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the Andaman archipelago, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia andamanica was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, making it well-suited for the island's unique environment. The plant was introduced for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion. It has since become an important part of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>
