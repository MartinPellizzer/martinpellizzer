                <h1>Acrotrema lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate acrotrema, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinct umbel-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Acrotrema lanceolatum is primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema lanceolatum has lanceolate leaves that are elongated and tapering, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow, with tubular structures and four petals, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema lanceolatum is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in humid and shaded forest environments. The plant thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soils of these ecosystems. It is commonly associated with the understory of evergreen and semi-evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema lanceolatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and subcoastal areas, often growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. This plant has been reported in several regions across the country, including the North Island and some parts of the South Island. It is considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the introduced range, with limited naturalization in the wild.</p>
