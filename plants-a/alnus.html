                    <h1>Alnus</h1>
<p>Alnus, commonly known as alder, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs belonging to the birch family (Betulaceae).</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, usually inconspicuous flowers. They are often found in moist or wet environments, such as stream banks and wetlands, due to their preference for well-drained to waterlogged soils. Alnus species are also notable for their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria in their root nodules.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 20 species, many of which are valued for their ecological roles and timber.</p>
