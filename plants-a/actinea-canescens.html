<p>Actinea canescens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette of silvery-white, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, showy white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in an umbel-like structure. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Actinea canescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
