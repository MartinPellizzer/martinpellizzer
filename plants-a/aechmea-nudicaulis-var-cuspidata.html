                    <h1>Aechmea nudicaulis var. cuspidata</h1>
<p>Aechmea nudicaulis var. cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped air plant, is a bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they have a pointed tip that distinguishes this variety from others. It produces striking red or orange flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
