<p>Asplenium tripteropus, commonly known as the three-winged maidenhair fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the wings of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium tripteropus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
