                    <h1>Anathallis carvalhoi</h1>
<p>Anathallis carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's spider orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescence, which consists of a single, elongated stem bearing a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
