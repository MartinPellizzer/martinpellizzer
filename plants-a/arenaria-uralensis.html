                    <h1>Arenaria uralensis</h1>
<p>Arenaria uralensis, commonly known as the Ural sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are low and the growing season is short.</p>
<p>Arenaria uralensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
