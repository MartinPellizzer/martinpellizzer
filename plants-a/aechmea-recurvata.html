                <h1>Aechmea recurvata</h1>
<p>Aechmea recurvata, commonly known as the recurved pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea recurvata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea recurvata has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem, with a dark green to bluish-gray color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem that is often hidden beneath the leaves, with a rough, fibrous texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower spike bearing white or pale blue flowers, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animal consumption and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its rocky or sandy habitat.</p>
