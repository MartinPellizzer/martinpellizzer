                    <h1>Aconitum napellus var. subtatrense</h1>
<p>Aconitum napellus var. subtatrense, commonly known as the Subtatar Monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid called aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is notable, though caution is necessary due to its potent toxicity.</p>
