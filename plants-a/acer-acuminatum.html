                <h1>Acer acuminatum</h1>
<p>Acer acuminatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 8–15 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer acuminatum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a wide range of morphological diversity, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse growth forms.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, a group of flowering plants that includes trees, shrubs, and climbers, often with showy flowers and fruits. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes plants with compound leaves and fruits that may be fleshy or dry. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maples, which are deciduous trees or shrubs with opposite leaves and distinctive sap.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer acuminatum, a specific type of maple known for its slender, acutely pointed leaves and is native to parts of East Asia.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer acuminatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning bright yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer acuminatum is a species of maple native to eastern China, specifically found in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited and fragmented, primarily in mountainous regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often growing in association with other temperate hardwoods. This species is typically found at altitudes between 800 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer acuminatum is considered a vulnerable species and is under conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer acuminatum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination. The growth cycle of this tree is slow to moderate, with new growth emerging in spring and foliage changing color in the fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended for optimal health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer acuminatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity through its canopy and root systems. It also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root network.</p>
<p>Additionally, its fallen leaves contribute to nutrient cycling, enhancing soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer acuminatum is a species of maple tree native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine texture, making it suitable for furniture and cabinetry. Culturally, the tree holds symbolic meaning in traditional Chinese and Japanese landscapes, representing resilience and harmony with nature.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer acuminatum plays a vital role in both natural ecosystems and human appreciation of botanical beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer acuminatum has a variety of cultivars, hybrids, and forms that contribute to its horticultural significance.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atrosanguineum' with its striking red foliage and 'Pumilum' known for its compact growth. It has been hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer negundo, to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced characteristics. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and foliage color, making them desirable for landscape use.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, Acer acuminatum holds important value in horticulture, especially in gardens seeking colorful and distinctive trees.</p>
