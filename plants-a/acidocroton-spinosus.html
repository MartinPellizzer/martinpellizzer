                <h1>Acidocroton spinosus</h1>
<p>Acidocroton spinosus, commonly known as the spiny croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and branched, woody stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton spinosus has compound, pinnate leaves that are elongated and lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is woody, cylindrical, and covered with rough, ridged bark that is typically gray to brown in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the rainy season, with a simple structure that relies on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, allowing it to thrive in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton spinosus is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments where it grows as an understory plant. This species is commonly found in dense vegetation along riverbanks and in secondary forest areas. It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to the western and central parts of the African continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton spinosus was mainly introduced to control invasive weeds in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in regions with tropical and subtropical climates due to its adaptability. The plant is known for its ability to grow in poor soil conditions, making it effective for land stabilization. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to both ecological and economic impacts in some regions.</p>
