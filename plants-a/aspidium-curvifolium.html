                    <h1>Aspidium curvifolium</h1>
<p>Aspidium curvifolium, commonly known as the curled-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with deeply lobed, curled leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats that can stabilize sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Aspidium curvifolium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity.</p>
