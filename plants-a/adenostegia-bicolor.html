                    <h1>Adenostegia bicolor</h1>
<p>Adenostegia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-colored leaves, typically green on the upper surface and pale or white on the underside. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries and excrete the seeds onto new host trees.</p>
<p>Adenostegia bicolor plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
