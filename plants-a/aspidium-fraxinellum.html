                    <h1>Aspidium fraxinellum</h1>
<p>Aspidium fraxinellum, commonly known as the European water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium fraxinellum is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
