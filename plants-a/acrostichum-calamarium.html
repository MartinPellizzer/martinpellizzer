                <h1>Acrostichum calamarium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum calamarium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage and clusters of small, showy blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It is drought-tolerant and well-adapted to harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum calamarium has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, with a dark green color and a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are light and equipped with feathery structures for aerial dissemination.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum calamarium is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, often near rivers and in swampy or wetland habitats. This plant thrives in environments with high moisture levels and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Its distribution extends from the Caribbean islands to parts of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in Southeast Asia, though this may be due to human introduction rather than natural range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum calamarium was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in brackish water marshes and tidal flats where it thrives in moist, saline environments. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly along shorelines. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic species.</p>
