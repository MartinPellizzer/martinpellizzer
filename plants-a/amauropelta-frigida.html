<p>Amauropelta frigida, commonly known as the cold rock fern, is a rare and resilient fern species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found on rocky slopes and in shaded forest understories. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Amauropelta frigida is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and climate change.</p>
