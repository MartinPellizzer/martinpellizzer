<p>Arceuthobium globosum subsp.</p>
<p>petersonii, commonly known as the Peterson's dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent.</p>
<p>The plant typically attaches to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in disturbed soils in arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
