                    <h1>Axonopus arsenei</h1>
<p>Axonopus arsenei, commonly known as the creeping spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Axonopus arsenei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it both a useful groundcover and a potential weed in cultivated landscapes.</p>
