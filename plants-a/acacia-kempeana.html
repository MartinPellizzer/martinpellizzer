                    <h1>Acacia kempeana</h1>
<p>Acacia kempeana, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia kempeana is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and nectar for local wildlife.</p>
