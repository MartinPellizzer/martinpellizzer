<p>Alnus viridis var. repens, commonly known as the creeping alder, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist environments.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession.</p>
