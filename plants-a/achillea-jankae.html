                <h1>Achillea jankae</h1>
<p>Achillea jankae, commonly known as Janka's yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features feathery, aromatic leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are bright green, with a hairy texture and a slightly serrated edge, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>Its stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine white hairs, growing from the base and reaching heights of about 30 to 50 centimeters. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite blooms arranged in flat, rounded heads, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, allowing the seeds to be dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly found in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open grasslands. This species thrives in high-altitude areas, typically between 1,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea jankae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter and active growth during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other drought-tolerant plants like lavender and yarrow in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering food and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared resources. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae is a lesser-known species of yarrow that has limited documented uses compared to its more widely studied relatives.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it may have potential in herbal medicine for its reported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Its role in industrial or economic contexts is minimal due to its lack of commercial cultivation or widespread use. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though this remains underexplored.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea jankae's applications are primarily speculative, requiring further research to fully understand its potential.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Frosted', which are known for their striking yellow foliage and delicate white flowers. While there are no widely recognized hybrids specifically bred for Achillea jankae, it is often crossbred with other yarrow species to enhance traits such as flowering time and disease resistance. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its role in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>This plant is a valuable addition to gardens, particularly in rock gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
