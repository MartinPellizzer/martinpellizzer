                <h1>Achillea jankae</h1>
<p>Achillea jankae, commonly known as Janka's yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its foliage is aromatic and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Janka's yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread and survival in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae is a perennial flowering plant native to the highlands of central Asia, specifically found in regions of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in limited areas within its native range, with some populations also present in botanical gardens and conservation facilities. This plant thrives in dry, rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny environments. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea jankae is considered to be of conservation concern, with some populations classified as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers, often grown for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring good light and well-draining soil. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in full sun to partial shade and requiring minimal watering once established.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it benefits from a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new blooms. While generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper air circulation and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the overall biodiversity of its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native species to enhance soil health and promote a balanced ecosystem. Its dense growth pattern also helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in disturbed or marginal areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea jankae contributes to ecological benefits by supporting a network of interdependent species within its local environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae is a lesser-known member of the sunflower family, primarily found in specific regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically noted for its aromatic properties. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though further research is needed. Its role in industrial applications is limited, but it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions, though its symbolic meanings are not as well-documented as those of more common plants.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea jankae has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Purpurea' and 'Flore Pleno', which are appreciated for their vibrant purple flowers and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Achillea jankae are often developed to enhance flower color, bloom duration, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids play an important role in horticulture, particularly in gardens and landscapes where they add visual interest and attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Their hardiness and low maintenance make them a favored choice for both amateur and professional gardeners.</p>
