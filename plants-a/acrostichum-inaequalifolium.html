                <h1>Acrostichum inaequalifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum inaequalifolium, commonly known as the variable fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often asymmetrical fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its fronds are usually compound, with a mix of varying leaf shapes and sizes along their length.</p>
<p>Acrostichum inaequalifolium is known for its adaptability and ability to thrive in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum inaequalifolium has large, elongated leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is robust and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming in the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, triangular capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize wetland areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum inaequalifolium is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and along riverbanks where the soil is moist and rich in nutrients. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with brackish water environments. It is also present in parts of eastern Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can occasionally be found in disturbed habitats near human settlements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum inaequalifolium was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and along streams, where it forms dense stands. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. However, its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain areas.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its spread to manage its ecological impact effectively.</p>
