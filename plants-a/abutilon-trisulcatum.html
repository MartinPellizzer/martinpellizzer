<p>Abutilon trisulcatum, commonly known as the three-ridged abutilon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves with three distinct ridges. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon trisulcatum has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy surface and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petals that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in summer and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon trisulcatum is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in parts of Central and South America, as well as in some Caribbean islands. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Abutilon trisulcatum is considered endangered in many regions, prompting conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon trisulcatum is a flowering plant known for its vibrant bracts and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
