                        <h1>Abutilon trisulcatum</h1>
<p>Abutilon trisulcatum, commonly known as the three-ridged abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in clusters. It produces small, three-lobed fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abutilon trisulcatum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of vascular plants that include ferns and horsetails, known for their complex vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants such as cotton and hibiscus, known for their showy flowers and specialized pollination mechanisms. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with velvety leaves and showy flowers, often adapted for specific pollinators. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "Chinese lantern," characterized by their hairy leaves and lantern-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon trisulcatum, a specific type of Abutilon known for its unique leaf patterns and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon trisulcatum is primarily native to Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, and Texas.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its hairy leaves and showy flowers, which contribute to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptability to different climatic conditions within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon trisulcatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there by early settlers or horticulturalists who valued its aesthetic appeal. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species in island environments.</p>
