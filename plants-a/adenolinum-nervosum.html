                <h1>Adenolinum nervosum</h1>
<p>Adenolinum nervosum, commonly known as the nerve plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Adenolinum nervosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or subtropical climate.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum nervosum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often twisting around supporting structures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in the plant's ability to climb and anchor itself to various substrates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum nervosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks in these areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it a characteristic species of African rainforests. It is often encountered in lowland and montane forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native range, it is not widely distributed outside of its natural habitat in Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum nervosum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent it from spreading uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily confined to areas where it is cultivated, but there are reports of it escaping into the wild in certain regions.</p>
