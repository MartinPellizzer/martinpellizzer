                    <h1>Astrophytum capricorne var. minus</h1>
<p>Astrophytum capricorne var. minus, commonly known as the miniature star cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color, adorned with radial spines and a crown of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stem, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The varietal name "minus" refers to its smaller size compared to the typical form of Astrophytum capricorne.</p>
