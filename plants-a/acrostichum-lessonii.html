                <h1>Acrostichum lessonii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lessonii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a tall, tree-like fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a trunk that is fibrous and covered in a layer of dead fronds. Its fronds are pinnate, with a long, narrow rachis and numerous pinnae that are often deeply lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lessonii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright and has a smooth, pale green bark. The plant produces inconspicuous, small yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that disperses its seeds through water, as the seeds are buoyant.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lessonii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other moist, saline environments. This plant thrives in humid climates with high salt tolerance, making it well adapted to coastal ecosystems. It is often seen growing on sandy shores or in estuarine habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends to some Caribbean islands, where it is an important component of the coastal flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lessonii was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in salt marshes and tidal flats. This plant is often associated with brackish water environments and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
