                <h1>Arceuthobium sichuanense</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium sichuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China, where it parasitizes various grass species. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>Its unique reproductive strategy involves seed dispersal through a mechanism called "explosive dehiscence," where the seeds are forcibly ejected from the fruit.</p>
