                <h1>Acrostichum pteroides</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pteroides, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a hairy or scaly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can reach lengths of up to two meters.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pteroides has large, elongated, feather-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are yellowish-green and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, spiny capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pteroides is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove forests, and swampy habitats where it thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions. This plant is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. It is often associated with wetland ecosystems and is well adapted to high humidity and fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pteroides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils where it can spread rapidly. This plant has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its distribution is often linked to human activities such as landscaping and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has established populations in multiple countries across the Americas and parts of Asia.</p>
