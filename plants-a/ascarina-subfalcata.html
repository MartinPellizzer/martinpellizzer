<p>Ascarina subfalcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf k≈çhanga, is a unique member of the Araucariaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its slender, drooping branches and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces distinctive, conifer-like cones that are often clustered in groups of three. It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of New Zealand's subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
