                    <h1>Alyssum arvaticum</h1>
<p>Alyssum arvaticum, commonly known as desert alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has compact, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Alyssum arvaticum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
