                    <h1>Aphelexis macrantha</h1>
<p>Aphelexis macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered tamarisk, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aphelexis macrantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
