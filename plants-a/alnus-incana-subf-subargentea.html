<p>Alnus incana subf.</p>
<p>subargentea, commonly known as silverleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on both surfaces of the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
