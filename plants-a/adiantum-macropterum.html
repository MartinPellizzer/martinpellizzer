                <h1>Adiantum macropterum</h1>
<p>Adiantum macropterum, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, needle-like pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of roots.</p>
<p>Adiantum macropterum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum macropterum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green, with a slender, upright growth pattern and a leathery texture. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is smooth and dark brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum macropterum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forest floors, stream banks, and swampy areas. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with sandy or acidic soils. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many of its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum macropterum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is often associated with horticultural practices and landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in these regions.</p>
