                <h1>Acrothamnus maccraei</h1>
<p>Acrothamnus maccraei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are followed by distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Acrothamnus maccraei is adapted to arid conditions and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus maccraei has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or brown in color. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from late autumn to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with the seeds being tiny and light.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus maccraei is primarily native to Victoria.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southeastern region of Australia, specifically within the state of Victoria. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in areas with a Mediterranean climate. The plant is adapted to the local environmental conditions of Victoria, including its climate and soil types.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and is often found in open woodlands and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus maccraei was mainly introduced to South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Riverland and Lower Murray areas. The plant is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, creek banks, and agricultural land. It has become a weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and changes in land use.</p>
