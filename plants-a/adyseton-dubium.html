                    <h1>Adyseton dubium</h1>
<p>Adyseton dubium, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Adyseton dubium is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
