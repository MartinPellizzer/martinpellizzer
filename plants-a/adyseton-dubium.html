                <h1>Adyseton dubium</h1>
<p>Adyseton dubium, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Adyseton dubium is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton dubium has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and erect, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow with five petals and appear in late spring, relying on insect pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton dubium is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically the coastal plains of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swampy areas, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological diversity.</p>
<p>However, its distribution has become limited due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton dubium was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, particularly in forested regions. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
