                <h1>Acrocarpus combretiflorus</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus combretiflorus, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus combretiflorus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus combretiflorus is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution also extends to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions like Madagascar and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is classified as a vulnerable species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus combretiflorus is a tropical tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification for better germination. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with flowering typically occurring after several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract some insects in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants can enhance its growth and soil health.</p>
