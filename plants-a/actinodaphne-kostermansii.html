                <h1>Actinodaphne kostermansii</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne kostermansii, commonly known as the Koster's camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>Its ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kostermansii has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale grey to brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The flowers are small, clustered in panicle inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal ingestion and droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and absorbing nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kostermansii is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in the lowland areas. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. It is a member of the Lauraceae family and is known for its aromatic leaves and unique fruit structure.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kostermansii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its native habitat in Southeast Asia is simulated.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests, often growing in shaded areas with high humidity. This plant has been introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
