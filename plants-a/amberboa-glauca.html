                    <h1>Amberboa glauca</h1>
<p>Amberboa glauca, commonly known as the blue amberboa, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
