<p>Atriplex perrieri, commonly known as the Desert Saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it survive in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Atriplex perrieri plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat and forage for desert wildlife.</p>
