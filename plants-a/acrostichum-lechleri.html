                    <h1>Acrostichum lechleri</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant is notable for its latex-producing properties, which have been historically used in the production of natural rubber. Its roots and bark contain compounds with potential medicinal applications, though it is not as widely studied as other rubber-producing plants.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological and economic significance, it plays an important role in both traditional practices and modern industries.</p>
