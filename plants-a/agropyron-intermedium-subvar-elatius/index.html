                            <h1>Agropyron Intermedium Subvar. Elatius</h1>
<p>Agropyron intermedium subvar. elatius is a hardy grass species known for its resilience in harsh environments. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in steppes and grasslands across central Asia. This plant is valued for its deep root system, which helps prevent soil erosion and improve land stability. Its ability to survive with minimal water makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects. Despite its tough nature, it also serves as a vital food source for grazing animals.</p>
