                <h1>Acianthera lamia</h1>
<p>Acianthera lamia, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>Acianthera lamia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses worldwide.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera lamia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals and a distinct, tubular structure that attracts pollinators like moths and bats. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera lamia is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the western and central highlands. This orchid thrives in humid, montane forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is often associated with cloud forests and is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Ecuador.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera lamia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant prefers partial shade to full sun and is typically grown in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11. Its introduction has been largely limited to regions where it can thrive without significant environmental stress.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is grown.</p>
