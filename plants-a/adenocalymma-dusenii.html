                <h1>Adenocalymma dusenii</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma dusenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma dusenii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils in which it grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma dusenii is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the state of Santa Catarina. This plant thrives in humid and subtropical climates, often growing in forested areas. It is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of the region, including well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific habitats within Brazil South.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma dusenii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. This plant is adapted to salty and windy conditions, making it a common sight in coastal environments. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
