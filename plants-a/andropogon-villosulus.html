<p>Andropogon villosulus, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, hairy leaves, and small, blue-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and open woodland habitats. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Hairy bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability.</p>
