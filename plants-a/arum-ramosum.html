                    <h1>Arum ramosum</h1>
<p>Arum ramosum, commonly known as the swamp arum, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy rhizome that serves as a storage organ for nutrients. The plant produces a striking, arrow-shaped leaf with a prominent midrib and a waxy sheath at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>Arum ramosum is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
