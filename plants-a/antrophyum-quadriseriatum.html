<p>Antrophyum quadriseriatum, commonly known as the four-row cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the eastern tropical rainforests of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and its unique, four-rowed structure in its leaf arrangement. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
