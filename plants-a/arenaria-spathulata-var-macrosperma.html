                    <h1>Arenaria spathulata var. macrosperma</h1>
<p>Arenaria spathulata var. macrosperma, commonly known as the broad-seeded sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its large, persistent seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize harsh environments.</p>
