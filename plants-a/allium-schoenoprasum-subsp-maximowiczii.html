<p>Allium schoenoprasum subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii, commonly known as Siberian chives, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant white or pale purple flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its robust underground bulbous structures, which contribute to its hardiness in harsh environments. It is closely related to other allium species, including common chives, but differs in its cold tolerance and growth habits.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its culinary use and ornamental appeal in gardens adapted to cooler climates.</p>
