<p>Athyrium imbricatum f. viride, commonly known as the green-ferns or green-leafed lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern species characterized by its distinctively green foliage.</p>
<p>This fern is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in woodland settings.</p>
