                <h1>Acnistus guayaquilensis</h1>
<p>Acnistus guayaquilensis, commonly known as the Guayaquil acnistus, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus guayaquilensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 3 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus guayaquilensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, including rainforests and secondary growth vegetation. This species thrives in warm, moist environments with high levels of sunlight. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the western Amazon basin and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus guayaquilensis was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats have contributed to its spread in these areas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor its distribution and impact on local biodiversity.</p>
