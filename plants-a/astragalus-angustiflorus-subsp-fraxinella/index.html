                            <h1>Astragalus Angustiflorus Subsp. Fraxinella</h1>
<p>Astragalus angustiflorus subsp. fraxinella is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western united states. it belongs to the legume family and is known for its small, yellow blooms that appear in late spring. this subspecies is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, making it well adapted to arid environments. due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique plant from threats like habitat loss and climate change.</p>
