                <h1>Achillea spinulosa</h1>
<p>Achillea spinulosa, commonly known as the thistle fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulosa has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture and a grayish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulosa is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is commonly found in dry, open habitats. It is often associated with Mediterranean climates and can be seen in grasslands and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Mediterranean region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulosa was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fluffy flower heads and hardy nature. This plant has since become naturalized in several regions, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent it from outcompeting native species.</p>
