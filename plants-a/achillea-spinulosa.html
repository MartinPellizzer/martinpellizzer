                <h1>Achillea spinulosa</h1>
<p>Achillea spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulosa has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray upper surface and a darker green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rough to the touch, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are compound umbels of small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulosa is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as Spain, Italy, and France.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of North Africa and the Middle East, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly found in Mediterranean-type climates. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea spinulosa is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its populations are relatively localized.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulosa is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a great choice for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the roots in early spring or fall, ensuring successful establishment. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and blooming from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its ornamental value and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both floral resources and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea spinulosa also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulosa is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat wounds and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>It has also been explored for potential culinary uses, though it is less commonly consumed than other members of the Asteraceae family. In industrial applications, its essential oils may find use in aromatherapy and natural fragrance products. Culturally, it has symbolic significance in various regions, often associated with healing and protection.</p>
<p>However, its applications are not as widely documented as those of other plants in its genus.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea spinulosa has several popular cultivars such as 'Paprika', 'Redhead', and 'Crimson Star', which are prized for their vibrant, long-lasting flower colors and architectural form.</p>
<p>These cultivars often exhibit enhanced disease resistance and improved flowering compared to the species. Hybrids involving Achillea spinulosa are less common but have been developed to combine traits like extended blooming periods and increased hardiness. The plant holds horticultural importance as a valuable addition to gardens, particularly in dry, sunny conditions where it thrives.</p>
<p>Its ability to attract pollinators also makes it a beneficial plant for ecological landscaping.</p>
