                    <h1>Alchemilla cymatophylla</h1>
<p>Alchemilla cymatophylla, commonly known as the woolly alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Alchemilla cymatophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal habitats.</p>
