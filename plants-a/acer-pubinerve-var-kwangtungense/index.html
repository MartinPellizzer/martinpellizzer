<p>Kwangtung maple, scientifically known as Acer pubinerve var. kwangtungense, is a strikingly beautiful deciduous tree native to southern China. It is prized for its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red, orange, and yellow, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The tree's heart-shaped leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes it from other maple varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a range of garden environments. With its unique appearance and seasonal beauty, the Kwangtung maple is a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
