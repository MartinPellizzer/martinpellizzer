                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. conglomerata</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive basal rosette of silver-green, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and its ability to form a dense ground cover.</p>
