                <h1>Adenosma polysperma</h1>
<p>Adenosma polysperma, commonly known as the many-seeded adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or shrublands.</p>
<p>Adenosma polysperma is noted for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma polysperma has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma polysperma is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant thrives in open habitats such as forests, grasslands, and along stream banks. It is often seen growing in shaded undergrowth or in disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with humid climates and is not widely spread beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma polysperma was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, where it thrives in nutrient-rich environments. This plant has spread across several regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in non-native areas.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study in many regions.</p>
