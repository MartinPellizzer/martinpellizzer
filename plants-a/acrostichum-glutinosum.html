                <h1>Acrostichum glutinosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glutinosum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is stout and woody with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. The plant produces inconspicuous, small flowers that are clustered in spikes, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in the late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glutinosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, including rainforests and wetlands. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and partial to full shade. Its natural range extends from Mexico down through countries such as Colombia, Brazil, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found along riverbanks and in secondary growth forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glutinosum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near beaches, dunes, and tidal zones. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its spread in new environments.</p>
<p>However, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in certain areas.</p>
