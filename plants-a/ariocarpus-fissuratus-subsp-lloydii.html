<p>Ariocarpus fissuratus subsp.</p>
<p>lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's fissured barrel cactus, is a rare and highly sought-after cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in specialized collections.</p>
