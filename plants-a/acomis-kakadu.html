                <h1>Acomis kakadu</h1>
<p>Acomis kakadu, commonly known as the Kakadu lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces fleshy, club-shaped berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by water and birds. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often floating on the water's surface, contributing to its aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>Acomis kakadu plays an important ecological role in its environment, supporting various insect and bird species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomis kakadu has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils and access water during dry periods.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis kakadu is primarily native to the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly seen in open habitats. It is an important part of the local ecosystem and supports various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the Northern Territory.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis kakadu was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
