<p>Alsophila eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. The plant produces a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Alsophila eriocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
