<p>Anacamptis pyramidalis subsp.</p>
<p>algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarbi orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a cluster of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, with narrow leaves and a compact inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
