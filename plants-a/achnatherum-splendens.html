                <h1>Achnatherum splendens</h1>
<p>Achnatherum splendens, commonly known as the glittering needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, awned flowers, which are typically pale green to golden in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the sun.</p>
<p>Achnatherum splendens is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum splendens has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to purple florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum splendens is primarily native to the central and western regions of North America.</p>
<p>It can be found in states such as Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. This grass species typically grows in open habitats like meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It is well adapted to semi-arid and arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often associated with rocky soils and can thrive in a variety of elevations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum splendens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It is often found in regions with moderate to high precipitation and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly spread through human activities, including seed dispersal via vehicles and agricultural machinery. It has become a common weed in many parts of North America.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a successful invasive species in many environments.</p>
