                        <h1>Acalypha integrifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, bract-based inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia is also known for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large order of flowering plants that includes many species with unique adaptations such as specialized leaves and flowers. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cudweed," characterized by their hairy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha integrifolia, a specific type of plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its distinctive leaf shape and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia is primarily native to Mauritius and RÃ©union.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant species that thrives in the tropical climates of these islands. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It plays an important role in the local ecosystems of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific locations due to its environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various parts of the country, particularly in coastal and urban areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through vegetative means. Its invasive potential has raised concerns among conservationists, as it can outcompete native species in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
