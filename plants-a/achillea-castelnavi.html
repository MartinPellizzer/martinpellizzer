                <h1>Achillea castelnavi</h1>
<p>Achillea castelnavi, commonly known as the Castelnau yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea castelnavi is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea castelnavi has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets that are pale yellow to white, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea castelnavi is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and north Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as southern France, Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. It typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands, scrublands, and along coastal areas. This species is usually found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea castelnavi is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea castelnavi is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, though division is more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant has a typical growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter, requiring minimal care once established.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, with moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after blooming helps maintain shape and encourage new growth. While generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea castelnavi is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both food and shelter. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Achillea castelnavi also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea castelnavi is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes, where it is often used for its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use, as its bitter taste makes it unsuitable for cooking. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat skin conditions and as a mild sedative due to its essential oil content. Culturally, it is sometimes associated with symbolism related to healing and resilience.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications are minimal, as it is primarily valued for its aesthetic and minor medicinal roles.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea castelnavi has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Snow Beauty' and 'Albiflora,' known for their pale, almost white flower heads and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Hybrids of this species are often developed to enhance traits such as flower color, disease resistance, and adaptability to different climates, leading to a variety of selections suitable for gardens. These cultivars and hybrids are valued in horticulture for their drought tolerance, long blooming period, and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. They are commonly used in perennial borders, rock gardens, and as edging plants due to their hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea castelnavi plays an important role in modern garden design, offering both aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
