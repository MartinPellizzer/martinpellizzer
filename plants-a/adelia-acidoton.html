                <h1>Adelia acidoton</h1>
<p>Adelia acidoton, commonly known as the sourleaf, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature and are edible, though they have a tart, acidic flavor.</p>
<p>Adelia acidoton is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia acidoton has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia acidoton is primarily native to the eastern regions of South Africa, specifically the coastal areas of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is commonly found in moist woodlands and along riverbanks. This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understory vegetation. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adelia acidoton is considered vulnerable in some parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia acidoton was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and roadside verges. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions have contributed to its establishment in the wild. It is considered a potential weed in some regions, posing a risk to native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management strategies are being developed to control its spread and minimize its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
