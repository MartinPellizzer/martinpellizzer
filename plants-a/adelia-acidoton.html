                    <h1>Adelia acidoton</h1>
<p>Adelia acidoton, commonly known as the sourleaf, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature and are edible, though they have a tart, acidic flavor.</p>
<p>Adelia acidoton is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
