                <h1>Acianthera pariaensis</h1>
<p>Acianthera pariaensis, commonly known as the Paria orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acianthera pariaensis is considered threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera pariaensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is mostly terrestrial, spreading along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a spurred lip, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and moths. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the humid, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pariaensis is primarily native to Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern region of the country, specifically in the state of Zulia. This orchid grows in humid tropical environments, often in forested areas. It is commonly associated with rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pariaensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate to high humidity levels. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It has been reported in several countries in South America and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction to new areas may pose ecological risks if it becomes invasive.</p>
