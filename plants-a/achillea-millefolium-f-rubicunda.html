<p>Achillea millefolium f. rubicunda, commonly known as the red-leaf yarrow, is a botanical variant of the common yarrow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish or purplish foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the species. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, suitable for a variety of garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rubicunda has leaves that are deeply divided into fine, feather-like segments, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy form. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by pinkish-red ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rubicunda is a variant of the common yarrow, native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of North America, where it has been introduced and naturalized. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this form is generally stable, though it may be locally threatened by habitat loss and overgrazing.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rubicunda is a striking perennial plant known for its vibrant red foliage and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
