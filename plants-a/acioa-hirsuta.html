                <h1>Acioa hirsuta</h1>
<p>Acioa hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy acioa, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Acioa hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa hirsuta has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a hairy texture and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa hirsuta is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. This plant thrives in coastal environments and is often associated with sandy soils near the shoreline. It is an herbaceous species that grows in low, open habitats.</p>
<p>Acioa hirsuta is also occasionally found in Florida and southern Georgia in the United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa hirsuta was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in open, sunny conditions. The plant has spread to several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities in certain gardening contexts.</p>
