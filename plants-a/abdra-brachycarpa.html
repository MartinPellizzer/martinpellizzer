                        <h1>Abdra brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Abdra brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited abdra, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, woody stems and dense clusters of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits that are typically less than 1 cm in length. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
