                    <h1>Anemia multiplex</h1>
<p>Anemia multiplex, commonly known as the "forest fern," is a unique plant species characterized by its complex, multi-layered fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. The plant exhibits a distinctive botanical structure with multiple stems and fronds that can reach several feet in length. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This rare species is also noted for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
