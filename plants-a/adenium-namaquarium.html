<p>Adenium namaquarium, commonly known as the Desert Crown, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its roots are deep and strong, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Adenium namaquarium is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardioactive compounds.</p>
