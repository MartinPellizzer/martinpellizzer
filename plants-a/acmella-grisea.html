                <h1>Acmella grisea</h1>
<p>Acmella grisea, commonly known as the green velvet flower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, vibrant yellow flowers. The plant has a short, bushy stem with dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Acmella grisea is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella grisea has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white in color, with a distinctive central cone-like structure, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella grisea is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, as well as some areas in the Caribbean. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, often near water bodies. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is currently listed as data deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella grisea is a flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or division, with the best results achieved in spring or early summer. The plant has a relatively short growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, but it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the gardenâ€™s aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
