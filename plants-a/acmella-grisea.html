                <h1>Acmella grisea</h1>
<p>Acmella grisea, commonly known as the purple spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by vibrant, colorful bracts that serve to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acmella grisea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella grisea has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark with a slight reddish tinge. The flowers are tiny, yellowish structures that form in clusters, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella grisea is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil South, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in wetland environments and is often associated with marshy or swampy habitats. The species is well-adapted to the humid climate and seasonal flooding typical of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella grisea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and ornamental plant trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. The plant has been reported in several countries, including parts of South America and the Caribbean. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains largely limited to areas with suitable climatic conditions.</p>
