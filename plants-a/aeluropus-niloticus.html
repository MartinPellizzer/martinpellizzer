                <h1>Aeluropus niloticus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus niloticus, commonly known as the Nile grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Aeluropus niloticus thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in wetland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus niloticus has grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly rolled, arranged in a basal rosette with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish hue, and grows in dense tufts or clumps. The flowers are small, spike-like clusters with pale green to yellowish bracts, blooming during the dry season, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-sided, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize soil and absorb water efficiently.</p>
