                    <h1>Adiantum edentulum f. refractum</h1>
<p>Adiantum edentulum f. refractum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The fronds emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance when crushed, which is a distinguishing feature of this particular fern form.</p>
