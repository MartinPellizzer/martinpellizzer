<p>Alisma alpestre, commonly known as mountain arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as mountain streams, marshes, and lake margins. The plant features narrow, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged. Its small, white or greenish flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Alisma alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
