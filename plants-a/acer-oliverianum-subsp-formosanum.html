                <h1>Acer oliverianum subsp. formosanum</h1>
<p>Acer oliverianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its small, palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum has ovate to elliptic leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 8 cm in length. The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in inflorescences, with yellow-green petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan, specifically found in the mountainous regions of the island. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within the central and southern parts of Taiwan.</p>
<p>This species thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and streamside areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat destruction, Acer oliverianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a valuable component of its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for maintaining biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in its habitat. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Overall, it contributes significantly to ecological balance by offering multiple environmental benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a lesser-known species of maple native to Taiwan, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>The tree plays a role in supporting local biodiversity and soil stabilization, contributing to its industrial and economic value in environmental conservation efforts. Culturally, it is a symbol of natural heritage in Taiwan, often featured in ecological education and conservation programs.</p>
<p>Its limited commercial use highlights the need for further research into its potential applications in traditional medicine and ecological restoration.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
