<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive, aromatic scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in regions with warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus longispicus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and pale underneath, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
