The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose cluster.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
