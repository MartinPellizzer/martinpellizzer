                <h1>Acourtia ciprianoi</h1>
<p>Acourtia ciprianoi, commonly known as the Cipriani's acourtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia ciprianoi has leaves that are narrowly elliptical, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a greyish-brown color and a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia ciprianoi is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia ciprianoi was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in areas with rocky and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Spain, France, and Italy, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant was likely introduced through human activities, including horticultural practices and accidental transport. It has adapted well to the local climate and has become established in several natural and semi-natural environments.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native flora in certain ecosystems.</p>
