                <h1>Achillea sordida</h1>
<p>Achillea sordida, commonly known as the dark yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has dark green, serrated leaves. Its pale yellow to white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, achene-like fruits.</p>
<p>Achillea sordida is known for its aromatic foliage and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sordida has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with a dark green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, with a pale green color and a slightly woody texture as it matures. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in flat, composite heads, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sordida is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This species thrives in rocky, dry habitats such as slopes and grasslands, often growing in well-drained soils. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea sordida is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sordida is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and delicate yellow flowers, commonly grown in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in the fall, ensuring good drainage and light conditions. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, becoming active in early spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning dead foliage in late autumn helps maintain its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or rust, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea sordida is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in a garden or natural setting. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of insects and small animals in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
