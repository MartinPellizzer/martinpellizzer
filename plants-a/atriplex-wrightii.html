<p>Atriplex wrightii, commonly known as Wright's saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
