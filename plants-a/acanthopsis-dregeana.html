<p>Acanthopsis dregeana, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
