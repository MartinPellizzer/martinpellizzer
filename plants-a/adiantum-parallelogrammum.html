                <h1>Adiantum parallelogrammum</h1>
<p>Adiantum parallelogrammum, commonly known as the button fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features feathery, finely divided fronds that resemble buttons, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats or clusters.</p>
<p>Adiantum parallelogrammum is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum parallelogrammum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a lanceolate shape, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green and have a delicate, silky texture. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows horizontally underground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, with a structure consisting of stamens and pistils, and is pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum parallelogrammum is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forest floors and rocky crevices. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with deciduous forests and is sometimes found near streams or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum parallelogrammum is a relatively small fern, typically growing to a height of less than a foot.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum parallelogrammum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in garden settings where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded borders. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
