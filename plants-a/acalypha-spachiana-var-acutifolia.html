                <h1>Acalypha spachiana var. acutifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha spachiana var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha spachiana var. acutifolia has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamens that are prominent and showy, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha spachiana var. acutifolia is a flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth, often growing in areas with high humidity and rich soil. This species typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions, though its conservation status may vary depending on local populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha spachiana var. acutifolia is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage bushiness. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or coleus can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>
