<p>Asarum chueyi, commonly known as Chinese wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, reddish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and is not widely cultivated for commercial use.</p>
