<p>Aloe barteri var. lutea, commonly known as the Orange Aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color, with a distinctive orange-tinted margin. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for their gel, which has moisturizing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe barteri var. lutea is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its leaves and reducing transpiration through a waxy cuticle.</p>
