                <h1>Acrostichum asterolepis</h1>
<p>Acrostichum asterolepis, commonly known as the star-leaved fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaflets. The plant features long, arching fronds with a dense arrangement of small, lanceolate pinnae. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a unique pattern of veins that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acrostichum asterolepis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum asterolepis has large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fibrous bark that becomes darker with age, and it grows in a clump-forming pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum asterolepis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in coastal mangrove forests and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally found in disturbed habitats near human settlements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum asterolepis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands where it forms dense stands. This plant has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Americas. Its rapid growth and spreading habit have led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects in regions with high rainfall.</p>
