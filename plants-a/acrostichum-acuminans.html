<p>It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands.</p>
