The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapted for specific pollinators. Due to habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and found only in a few isolated locations.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
