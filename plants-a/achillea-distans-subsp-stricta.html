                <h1>Achillea distans subsp. stricta</h1>
<p>Achillea distans subsp.</p>
<p>stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea distans subsp.</p>
<p>stricta has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The leaves are relatively narrow, with a pointed tip, and are usually gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark, and grows in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat, rounded clusters, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea distans subsp.</p>
<p>stricta is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in rocky and dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland cliffs. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea distans subsp.</p>
<p>stricta is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing foliage in the first year and flowering in the second before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like thyme or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
