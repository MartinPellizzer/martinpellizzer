                <h1>Adiantum ornatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum ornatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth habit with a short, thick rhizome that supports its feathery foliage. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a unique, almost translucent appearance when mature.</p>
<p>Adiantum ornatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum ornatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a glossy surface and a finely serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem. The stems are slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and it reproduces through the release of spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ornatum is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It can be found in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky stream banks. The plant is also native to parts of southeastern Canada, including Ontario and Quebec. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum ornatum is commonly found in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Tennessee.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ornatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
