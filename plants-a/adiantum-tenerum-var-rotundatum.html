                    <h1>Adiantum tenerum var. rotundatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum tenerum var. rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a single row along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
