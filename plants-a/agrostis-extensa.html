                    <h1>Agrostis extensa</h1>
<p>Agrostis extensa, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
