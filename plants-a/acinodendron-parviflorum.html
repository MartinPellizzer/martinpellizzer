                <h1>Acinodendron parviflorum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acinodendron parviflorum is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron parviflorum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron parviflorum is primarily native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with riverine forests and can be found in protected areas within its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron parviflorum was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, where it was brought for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and small white flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become an invasive species in these areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often spreading through bird-dispersed seeds. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and protect native biodiversity.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, Acinodendron parviflorum poses significant ecological threats in its non-native range.</p>
