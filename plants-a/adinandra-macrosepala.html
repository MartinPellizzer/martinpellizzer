                <h1>Adinandra macrosepala</h1>
<p>Adinandra macrosepala, commonly known as the large-sepaled adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Adinandra macrosepala is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in humid tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra macrosepala has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in water absorption during dry periods.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra macrosepala is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. The plant thrives in humid tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is particularly common in the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.</p>
<p>Adinandra macrosepala is an important component of the understory vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra macrosepala was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas in Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in secondary forests, along roadsides, and in abandoned farmlands due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions. The plant thrives in tropical climates and is often considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is also valued for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes used in horticulture.</p>
