                <h1>Adenola glauca</h1>
<p>Adenola glauca, commonly known as the blue adenola, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Adenola glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenola glauca has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a bluish-green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, often branching, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly rough to the touch. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenola glauca is primarily native to parts of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Adenola glauca is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenola glauca was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with mild climates and well-drained soils. The plant has established populations in several areas outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. Its rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread in these regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
