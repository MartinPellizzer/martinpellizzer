                <h1>Acosta tossiensis</h1>
<p>Acosta tossiensis, commonly known as the Tossi's acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta tossiensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta tossiensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly rough upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals with yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in the moist soil and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta tossiensis is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude environments, including cloud forests and mountainous areas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific microclimates that provide the necessary conditions for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta tossiensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific coast of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas with sandy soils and is often associated with human-modified landscapes. This plant has been observed thriving in disturbed environments, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to its spread along the coastline, where it can compete with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
