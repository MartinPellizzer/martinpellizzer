                    <h1>Antennaria rupicola</h1>
<p>Antennaria rupicola, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in its often harsh, rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for alpine or rocky garden settings.</p>
<p>Antennaria rupicola is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural environment.</p>
