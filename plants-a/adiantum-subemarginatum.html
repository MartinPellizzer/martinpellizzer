                <h1>Adiantum subemarginatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum subemarginatum, commonly known as the marginal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum subemarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum subemarginatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lanceolate shape and a finely serrated margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and wiry with a smooth, light green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in early summer, though they are not showy. The fruit is a dry, club-shaped capsule that splits to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subemarginatum is primarily native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Cambodia. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. It is commonly associated with rocky or calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these areas, reflecting its ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subemarginatum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as an ornamental plant due to its delicate fronds and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, where it is appreciated for its aesthetic value. Despite its popularity, it has shown limited naturalization in the wild, with only a few isolated populations reported in the Pacific Northwest. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts, though it remains a relatively minor invasive species compared to others.</p>
