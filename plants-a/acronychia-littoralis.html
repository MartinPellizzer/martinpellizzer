                <h1>Acronychia littoralis</h1>
<p>Acronychia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a valuable component of coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia littoralis has alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture and serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and they bloom from late spring to early summer, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network, helping to stabilize the plant in coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia littoralis is primarily native to New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests along the eastern coast of Australia. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within New South Wales, where it is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia littoralis was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of northern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Queensland and the Northern Territory. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites, including roadsides and cleared lands. Its distribution is largely limited to the northern parts of the continent due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in these ecosystems.</p>
