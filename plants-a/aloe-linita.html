<p>Aloe linita, commonly known as the woolly aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are typically bluish-green in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to the plant.</p>
<p>Aloe linita is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
