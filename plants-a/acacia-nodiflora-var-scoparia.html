                        <h1>Acacia nodiflora var. scoparia</h1>
<p>Acacia nodiflora var. scoparia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nodiflora var. scoparia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands. This variety is well adapted to dry climates and can withstand periods of drought. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also influenced by its ability to grow in nutrient-poor environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nodiflora var. scoparia was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions of Southeast Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments.</p>
