<p>Acacia nodiflora var. scoparia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
