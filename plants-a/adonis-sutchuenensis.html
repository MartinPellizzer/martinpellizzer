                <h1>Adonis sutchuenensis</h1>
<p>Adonis sutchuenensis, commonly known as the Sichuan adonis, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis sutchuenensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are bright yellow, consisting of five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The plant produces follicles as its fruit, containing small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis sutchuenensis is primarily native to China North-Central and China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at higher elevations. The distribution includes parts of Sichuan and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>It is an important species in the local flora of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis sutchuenensis was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the U.S. in the early 20th century by botanical gardens and horticultural societies. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in natural habitats across several states. It is particularly common in the western United States, including California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
