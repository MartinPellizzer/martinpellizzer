<p>Acanthopsis carduifolia var. longearistata, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and visually striking plant.</p>
