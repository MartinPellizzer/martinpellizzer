                <h1>Adiantopsis pentagona</h1>
<p>Adiantopsis pentagona, commonly known as the pentagonal maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantopsis pentagona has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a dark green color and a delicate, glossy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. This plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ornamental value and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantopsis pentagona is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture. It is often associated with calcareous soils and can be found in both natural and disturbed wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantopsis pentagona was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant has been documented in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is believed to be due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in these areas and is primarily a native species in its natural range.</p>
