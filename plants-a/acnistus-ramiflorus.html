                <h1>Acnistus ramiflorus</h1>
<p>Acnistus ramiflorus, commonly known as the branched-flower acnistus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in branched clusters, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus ramiflorus has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, often branching profusely, with a smooth, light green to pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a hairy calyx, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus ramiflorus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Arabia and the eastern coast of Africa. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and shrublands. It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus ramiflorus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering structure.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several states, including Florida and Texas, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its establishment in these regions. It is often found in roadsides, pastures, and along riverbanks, where it can form dense stands.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some areas, as it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
