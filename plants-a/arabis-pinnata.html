<p>Arabis pinnata, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a fern-like appearance. Its small, white or yellowish flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>Arabis pinnata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
