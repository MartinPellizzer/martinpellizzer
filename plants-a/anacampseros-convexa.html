                    <h1>Anacampseros convexa</h1>
<p>Anacampseros convexa, commonly known as the convex euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Anacampseros convexa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
