<p>Arenaria littoralis, commonly known as the sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils along shorelines, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, helping it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
