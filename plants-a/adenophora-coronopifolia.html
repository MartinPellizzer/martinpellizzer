                <h1>Adenophora coronopifolia</h1>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia, commonly known as the crownleaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats and prefers well-drained soil. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive crown-like foliage and bell-shaped blossoms.</p>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, and vary in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and exhibits a somewhat woody texture, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a spreading or upright manner depending on the environment. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five petals and a prominent central spur, typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia is primarily native to East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas, particularly in the temperate zones of these countries. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy habitats. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shady areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is often linked to ornamental planting and seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
