                    <h1>Andropogon maritimus</h1>
<p>Andropogon maritimus, commonly known as sea grass or coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes helps prevent erosion in maritime environments.</p>
