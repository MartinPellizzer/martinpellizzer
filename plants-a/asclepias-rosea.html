                    <h1>Asclepias rosea</h1>
<p>Asclepias rosea, commonly known as the rose milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pink to rose-colored flowers and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Asclepias rosea plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat.</p>
