<p>Alectorolophus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>

The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or yellow throat. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
