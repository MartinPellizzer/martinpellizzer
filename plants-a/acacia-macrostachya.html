                        <h1>Acacia macrostachya</h1>
<p>Acacia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant acacia or desert wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, straight thorns and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria.</p>
<p>Acacia macrostachya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
