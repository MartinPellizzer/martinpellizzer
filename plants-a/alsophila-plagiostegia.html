                    <h1>Alsophila plagiostegia</h1>
<p>Alsophila plagiostegia, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, spore-bearing cones, which are typically found on the lower part of the trunk. Alsophila plagiostegia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
