<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp.</p>
<p>graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically floating or submersed, adapted to its aquatic environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in waterlogged habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
