<p>Acetosa officinalis, commonly known as common sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its serrated leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is known for its tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Its leaves are often used in cooking, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosa officinalis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and typically reddish-brown in color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, black seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to thrive in sandy or calcareous soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosa officinalis is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>Its current distribution also extends to some regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Acetosa officinalis is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
