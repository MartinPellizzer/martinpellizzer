                    <h1>Angiopteris subintegerrima</h1>
<p>Angiopteris subintegerrima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages, typical of ferns. Its rhizomes are thick and woody, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
