                    <h1>Arundo dioeca</h1>
<p>Arundo dioeca, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, bamboo-like stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water sources such as rivers and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an important plant in ecological restoration and erosion control.</p>
