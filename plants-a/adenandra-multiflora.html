                <h1>Adenandra multiflora</h1>
<p>Adenandra multiflora, commonly known as the Natal hakea, is a South African shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white, urn-shaped flowers. The plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adenandra multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra multiflora has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 6 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, often branching, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's need for quick nutrient absorption in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra multiflora is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the western and southern regions of this area. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation. It thrives in areas with mild, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra multiflora was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the coast, thriving in coastal fynbos vegetation. This plant is often used in horticulture due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
