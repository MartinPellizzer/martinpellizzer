                    <h1>Aeschynomene villosa var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Aeschynomene villosa var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican hairy tops, is a tropical annual legume native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used as a forage crop or in soil conservation efforts.</p>
