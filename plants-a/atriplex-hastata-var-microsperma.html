                    <h1>Atriplex hastata var. microsperma</h1>
<p>Atriplex hastata var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable species for stabilizing soils in saline areas.</p>
<p>The plant's compact growth habit and drought resistance contribute to its ecological importance in desert ecosystems.</p>
