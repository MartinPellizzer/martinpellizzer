                <h1>Acrostichum neriifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum neriifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and wetlands. Its fronds are often divided into numerous narrow, linear segments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum neriifolium has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a feathery appearance and a size ranging from 1 to 3 meters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright and has a smooth, slender texture with a pale brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed drupe that disperses its seeds through wind after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum neriifolium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other humid, saline environments. This plant thrives in brackish water conditions and is often associated with tidal flats and estuaries. Its natural range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>Acrostichum neriifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum neriifolium was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southeastern Queensland, Australia, as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and tolerance to salt spray.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in wetland and riparian areas, often forming dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and spreading habit have led to its classification as a weed in some areas, posing a threat to local ecosystems. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through horticultural trade, where it was cultivated for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, its invasive potential has prompted management efforts to control its spread in affected regions.</p>
