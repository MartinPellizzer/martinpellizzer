<p>Ananas var. glaber, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces a spiky, fleshy fruit that develops from the central stem after flowering. The fruit is prized for its sweet, aromatic flesh and is widely cultivated for both commercial and culinary use.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is a member of the genus Ananas.</p>
