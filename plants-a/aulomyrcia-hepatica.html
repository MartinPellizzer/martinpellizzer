<p>Aulomyrcia hepatica, commonly known as the liverleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aulomyrcia hepatica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
