                <h1>Acer rubrum var. rubrum</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The red maple is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrum has simple, alternate, ovate to triangular leaves that are 5–10 cm long and 3–6 cm wide, with a serrated margin and a red or purple tint on the underside, turning bright red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth when young, becoming fissured and reddish-brown with age, and exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. It produces small, red sepals in clusters of 3–5, which resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the wing-like structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, forming a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrum is a native species of eastern North America, originally found from southeastern Canada through the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes much of the eastern United States, though it has been introduced to other regions as well. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in a variety of environments, including forests, stream valleys, and wetlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from lowlands up to around 600 meters.</p>
<p>It is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating a stable population and no immediate threat to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrum is a vibrant red maple tree known for its striking fall foliage and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this tree includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and peak foliage in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, though it can tolerate both moist and dry conditions. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning to remove dead or diseased branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like anthracnose can affect leaves, and companion planting with shade-tolerant species can enhance its overall landscape value.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrum is a vital component of eastern North American ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest understories, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrum is a native North American tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While its leaves are not typically used in culinary applications, the tree provides habitat and food for numerous wildlife species. In traditional medicine, various parts of the tree have been used by indigenous peoples for their potential health benefits. Industrially, it contributes to the forestry sector, supporting timber and paper production.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes the changing seasons and is a popular subject in art and literature.</p>
