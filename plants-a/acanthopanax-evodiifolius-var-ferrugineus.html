<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and a reddish-brown pubescence on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax evodiifolius var. ferrugineus has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, berry-like drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal ingestion and dropping.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with lateral branches, adapted for anchoring and nutrient absorption in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax evodiifolius var. ferrugineus is a variant of a shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, primarily found in Korea and northeastern China.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Europe, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates, growing in forested areas and rocky soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in its native range, though its conservation status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax evodiifolius var. ferrugineus is a hardy shrub commonly propagated through seed or stem cuttings, with cuttings showing the highest success rate.</p>
<p>It has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years. This plant prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and promote air circulation are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to aphids and powdery mildew, and is often grown with companion plants like lavender or rosemary for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax evodiifolius var. ferrugineus is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and enhancing soil stability. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing rocky or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>
