                    <h1>Actinoschoenus humbertii</h1>
<p>Actinoschoenus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's starwort, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white flowers arranged in a radial pattern. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with nutrient-rich substrates, often found in marshy environments. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted to reduce water resistance while maximizing light absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Actinoschoenus humbertii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
