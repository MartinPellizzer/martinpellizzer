                <h1>Actinostemma palmatum</h1>
<p>Actinostemma palmatum, commonly known as the palmate actinostemma, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes resembling a hand. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Actinostemma palmatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and delicate blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemma palmatum has palmately compound leaves that are typically broad and lobed, arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma palmatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, including the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This plant is also present in parts of Korea and Japan, where it grows in similar ecological conditions. It is often associated with shaded undergrowth in deciduous or evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma palmatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, palm-like appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
