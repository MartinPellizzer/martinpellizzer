                <h1>Acrostemon eriocephalus</h1>
<p>Acrostemon eriocephalus, commonly known as the woolly arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, white flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and water features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon eriocephalus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon eriocephalus is a flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including the Caribbean and parts of the United States, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rainforests or along riverbanks, and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. This species is usually found at low altitudes, typically below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Acrostemon eriocephalus is not considered threatened, but its wild populations are becoming increasingly rare due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrostemon eriocephalus is a tropical ornamental plant known for its striking blue flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by seed, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining cultivar traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming in late spring and continuing to flower through early summer with proper care.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage blooming are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrostemon eriocephalus is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutual benefits. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports biodiversity by offering nectar and habitat in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
