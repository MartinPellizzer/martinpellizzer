                <h1>Adesmia viscida</h1>
<p>Adesmia viscida, commonly known as the sticky adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces pods that contain seeds. Its sticky secretions may play a role in deterring herbivores or facilitating seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Adesmia viscida is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia viscida has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat succulent, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia viscida is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats and arid regions. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often seen growing along rocky outcrops and in open grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia viscida was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions for its ecological benefits. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent unintended spread.</p>
