                <h1>Actinodaphne procera</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne procera, commonly known as the giant laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and aromatic bark. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its timber and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne procera has elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with smooth, greyish bark that becomes rougher with age, and they grow upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersed by birds and mammals that eat the flesh.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne procera is primarily native to Jawa, Myanmar, and the Nicobar Is.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded environments. The species is known for its aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne procera was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in areas with similar environmental conditions. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as secondary forests, roadsides, and abandoned agricultural lands. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions beyond its native range, sometimes resulting in ecological impacts.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
