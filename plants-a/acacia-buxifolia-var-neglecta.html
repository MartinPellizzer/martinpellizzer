                        <h1>Acacia buxifolia var. neglecta</h1>
<p>Acacia buxifolia var. neglecta, commonly known as the dwarf acacia or coastal acacia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, yellow, spherical flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia buxifolia var. neglecta is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal sand dunes and rocky outcrops along the shoreline. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh coastal environment. It is often seen in areas with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia buxifolia var. neglecta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
