                    <h1>Alpagrostis setacea var. flava</h1>
<p>Alpagrostis setacea var. flava, commonly known as yellow beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish to golden spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture that gives it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Yellow beardgrass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
