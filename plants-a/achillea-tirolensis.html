                <h1>Achillea tirolensis</h1>
<p>Achillea tirolensis, commonly known as Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with silver-gray, finely divided leaves and flat, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant produces numerous small, composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Achillea tirolensis is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tirolensis has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a silver-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and attached pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tirolensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly the Alps.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. This plant thrives in alpine meadows and open slopes, often in areas with well-drained soil. Its native range includes countries such as Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy.</p>
<p>It is a characteristic species of the alpine flora and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tirolensis was mainly introduced to gardens and naturalized areas in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers and hardy nature. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas beyond cultivation, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a low-risk species in most ecosystems.</p>
