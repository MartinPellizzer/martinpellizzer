                    <h1>Agave flavescens</h1>
<p>Agave flavescens, commonly known as the yellow agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Agave flavescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
