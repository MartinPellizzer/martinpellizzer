<p>Arctium lepidum, commonly known as the burdock plant, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces purple flower heads that develop into spiny, bur-like fruits, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Arctium lepidum thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
