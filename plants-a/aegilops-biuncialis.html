<p>Aegilops biuncialis, commonly known as the two-lobed goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelet structure with two lateral branches. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aegilops biuncialis is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
