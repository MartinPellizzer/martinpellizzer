                <h1>Aegilops biuncialis</h1>
<p>Aegilops biuncialis, commonly known as the two-lobed goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelet structure with two lateral branches. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aegilops biuncialis is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops biuncialis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and range in length from 10 to 30 centimeters with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to yellowish color, and grows upright with a branching pattern near the base. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lipped, violet-blue florets that bloom in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-angled caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>
