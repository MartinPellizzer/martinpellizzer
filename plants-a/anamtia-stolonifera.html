                    <h1>Anamtia stolonifera</h1>
<p>Anamtia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping anamtia, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It produces stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the soil surface. The plant typically features small, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers are usually clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular petals that attract pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>Anamtia stolonifera is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
