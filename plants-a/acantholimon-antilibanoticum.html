<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon antilibanoticum is primarily native to Lebanon-Syria.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in the mountainous regions of these countries. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. The species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and is often found in areas with well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon antilibanoticum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, typically in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure, making it well-suited for dry, coastal or mountainous habitats. This plant is often found in disturbed or marginal lands, such as roadsides, wastelands, and degraded soils. Its introduction has been primarily due to its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has become established.</p>
