                <h1>Acrostichum marginale</h1>
<p>Acrostichum marginale, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and marshes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with narrow, lance-shaped segments.</p>
<p>Acrostichum marginale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum marginale has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, slender texture and a pale greenish-brown color, exhibiting a clumping growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spadices, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-chambered capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with each seed having a tuft of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum marginale is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, riverbanks, and moist lowland forests where it thrives in humid, warm climates. This fern is particularly abundant in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Cuba. It prefers well-drained soils and is often seen growing along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from the Caribbean islands to the northern regions of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum marginale was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, saline conditions. This plant is often seen in urban landscapes and agricultural areas where it establishes itself rapidly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for certain wildlife species.</p>
