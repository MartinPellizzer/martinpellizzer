<p>Andropogon osikensis, commonly known as the Osage grass, is a tall perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its roots are fibrous and form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Osage grass is often found in prairie ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
