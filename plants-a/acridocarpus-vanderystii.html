                <h1>Acridocarpus vanderystii</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus vanderystii, commonly known as Vanderyst's acridocarp, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants known for their toxic sap and aromatic properties. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus vanderystii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus vanderystii is primarily native to Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is typically found in lowland areas with tropical rainforest habitats. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific regions within these two countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus vanderystii was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine. The plant has adapted well to tropical climates and is now found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is being monitored for ecological impacts.</p>
