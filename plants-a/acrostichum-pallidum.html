                <h1>Acrostichum pallidum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pallidum, commonly known as the pale brake fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pallidum plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pallidum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, with a light green color and a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with greenish-white petals, blooming in late spring, and is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pallidum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove forests and tidal swamps. This plant is well adapted to brackish water conditions and often grows in association with other halophytic species. Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Australian Archipelago, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pallidum is an important component of the ecological systems in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pallidum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, construction sites, and urban environments. This plant has a tendency to spread rapidly due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its introduction has led to competition with native species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive in all areas and is sometimes used for erosion control.</p>
