<p>Acrostichum pallidum, commonly known as the pale brake fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pallidum plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
