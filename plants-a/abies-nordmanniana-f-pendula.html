                    <h1>Abies nordmanniana f. pendula</h1>
<p>Abies nordmanniana f. pendula, commonly known as the hanging fir, is a unique variant of the Nordmann fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping branches that give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. This form is a natural mutation of the parent species, Abies nordmanniana, and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant retains the typical coniferous features of the species, including needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structures.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
