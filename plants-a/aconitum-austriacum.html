                <h1>Aconitum austriacum</h1>
<p>Aconitum austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum austriacum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a dark brown to black bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright and branching towards the top. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
