<p>Thuringian wormwood, scientifically known as Artemisia rupestris var. thuringiaca, is a hardy perennial shrub native to central Europe. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open landscapes and along roadsides. This plant is characterized by its silver-green foliage and aromatic leaves that release a distinctive scent when crushed. With its resilience and ornamental value, it has become a popular choice for gardeners and landscapers. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a natural deterrent for pests adds to its significance.</p>
