                    <h1>Atriplex turcica</h1>
<p>Atriplex turcica, commonly known as Turkish saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable species for reclaiming saline soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex turcica is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
