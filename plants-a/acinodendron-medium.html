                <h1>Acinodendron medium</h1>
<p>Acinodendron medium, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, typically appearing in yellow or greenish-white hues.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron medium has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron medium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it a common species in tropical rainforests. It is also occasionally found in some parts of southern Thailand and western New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron medium was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and resilience to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has since spread into nearby native vegetation, raising concerns about its potential to become invasive. It thrives in sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, which contributes to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied by environmental scientists.</p>
