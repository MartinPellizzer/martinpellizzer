                    <h1>Agave rudis</h1>
<p>Agave rudis, commonly known as the sea agave, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, spiky flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its rosette growth pattern helps it resist wind and salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Agave rudis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
