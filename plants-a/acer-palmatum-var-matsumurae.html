                <h1>Acer palmatum var. matsumurae</h1>
<p>Acer palmatum var. matsumurae, commonly known as the Matsumura Japanese maple, is a cultivar native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, finely dissected leaves that display a range of colors throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its foliage turns vibrant red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, requiring moderate water and protection from strong winds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. matsumurae has finely dissected, trifoliate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a palmate arrangement and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in upright clusters. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. matsumurae is a rare variant of the Japanese maple native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, specifically Honshu and Shikoku.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat consists of moist, shaded forests at elevations ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters. While it was historically confined to these specific areas, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide. The species faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection, leading to its classification as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique plant in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. matsumurae is a compact, ornamental maple known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and vibrant seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or by seed, though the latter method is slower and less reliable. This variety thrives in partial shade to full sun, requiring well-draining, slightly acidic soil and consistent moisture during the growing season. Fertilize with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care and companion plants like hostas or ferns that improve soil moisture and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. matsumurae is a decorative ornamental tree that provides aesthetic value and contributes to urban and garden ecosystems by offering shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity in the local environment. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the visual appeal and ecological balance of the landscape. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>This plant also offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing microhabitats for smaller organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. matsumurae is a decorative ornamental plant primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves are occasionally used in traditional Japanese crafts and decorations.
