<p>Atriplex argentea var. rydbergii, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal and desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
