<p>Acacia disparrima subsp.</p>
<p>calidestris, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seed pods are woody and contain small, angular seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood.</p>
