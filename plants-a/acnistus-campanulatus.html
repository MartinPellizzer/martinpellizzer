                <h1>Acnistus campanulatus</h1>
<p>Acnistus campanulatus, commonly known as the bellflower acnistus, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It features opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus campanulatus has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, with a smooth texture, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length; they are usually a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and has a slightly hairy texture, with a light green to pale yellowish color. The flowers are clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus campanulatus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Madagascar, and parts of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and is often associated with lowland and montane forests. Its distribution extends to some parts of Southeast Asia, though it is less common there compared to its African range.</p>
<p>Acnistus campanulatus is also occasionally found in the Caribbean and northern South America, likely due to human introduction.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus campanulatus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which can be carried by wind, water, or animals. It has become a problematic invasive species in several regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystem balance.</p>
