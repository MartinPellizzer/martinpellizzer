                    <h1>Agelanthus subulatus</h1>
<p>Agelanthus subulatus, commonly known as the slender agelanthus, is a rare and delicate plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, succulent shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow, needle-like, and often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
