<p>Ascolepis pusilla var. cylindrica, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense inflorescences. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune habitats.</p>
