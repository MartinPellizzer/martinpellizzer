                    <h1>Alisma subcordatum var. superbum</h1>
<p>Alisma subcordatum var. superbum, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland ecosystem stability.</p>
