                <h1>Achasma coccineum</h1>
<p>Achasma coccineum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, vibrant red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Achasma coccineum is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achasma coccineum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with red petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achasma coccineum is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America, specifically found in countries like Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of the United States and Europe, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or along stream banks. This species is generally found at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Achasma coccineum is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achasma coccineum is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant red flowers and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring stratification for better germination. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming in early summer and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and moderate watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achasma coccineum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing vulnerable landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achasma coccineum contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
