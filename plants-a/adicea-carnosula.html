                <h1>Adicea carnosula</h1>
<p>Adicea carnosula, commonly known as the red-flowered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to produce seed pods that persist into winter.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea carnosula has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, glossy green surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea carnosula is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often found in areas with high rainfall. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Southeast Asia, though its presence there is less documented.</p>
<p>Adicea carnosula is a small shrub that plays a role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses in some communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea carnosula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, which has contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to control its distribution and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
