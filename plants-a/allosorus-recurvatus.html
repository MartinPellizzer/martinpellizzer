<p>Allosorus recurvatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Allosorus recurvatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
