                <h1>Acinodendron macrote</h1>
<p>Acinodendron macrote, commonly known as the large-fruited acinodendron, is a shrub native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in woodland and scrub habitats, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron macrote has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron macrote is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across several countries including Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This species thrives in humid lowland rainforests and is often found near streams or in shaded undergrowth. Acinodendron macrote typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
