<p>Actinea acaulis var. lanigera, commonly known as the woolly star, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance, particularly on the undersides of its leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its overall appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
