<p>Armeria fibrosa, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, wind-swept environments. The plant produces pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Armeria fibrosa is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
