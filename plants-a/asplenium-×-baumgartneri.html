                    <h1>Asplenium × baumgartneri</h1>
<p>Asplenium × baumgartneri, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure typical of the Asplenium genus. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically used for propagation and is more valued for its ornamental appearance.</p>
