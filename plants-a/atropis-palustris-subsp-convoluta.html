<p>Atropis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>convoluta, commonly known as the marsh buttonweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in damp environments.</p>
<p>It is typically found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
