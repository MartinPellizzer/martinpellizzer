                    <h1>Acacia frigescens</h1>
<p>Acacia frigescens, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Acacia frigescens is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
