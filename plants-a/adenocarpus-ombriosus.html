                    <h1>Adenocarpus ombriosus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus ombriosus, commonly known as the cloud forest dodder, is a parasitic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and develops distinctive, inflated seed pods that release tiny seeds. Its growth is often restricted to shaded, humid environments, making it a characteristic component of cloud forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
