                <h1>Achmandra zeylanica</h1>
<p>Achmandra zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian fig tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, fig-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The fruit, which is inedible for humans, serves as a food source for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra zeylanica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular throat, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra zeylanica is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sri Lanka and parts of India.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical areas around the world. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forests and along stream banks. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its introduction to new areas may pose ecological challenges.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achmandra zeylanica is a flowering plant native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
