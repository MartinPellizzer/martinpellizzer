                <h1>Achmandra zeylanica</h1>
<p>Achmandra zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon achmandra, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial with upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achmandra zeylanica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra zeylanica has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a straight, upright pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, and they bloom from April to June, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra zeylanica is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands and marshy areas. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with riverbanks and floodplains. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its preference for moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra zeylanica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal medicine practices. Its introduction has been associated with both horticultural and pharmacological interests.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
