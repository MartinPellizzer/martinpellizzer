                <h1>Acer oblongum var. erythrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited maple, is a variant of the maple tree characterized by its distinctive red or orange-red samaras.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and the Korean Peninsula. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant yellow to red in the fall. Its small, clustered flowers appear in early spring, followed by its striking red fruits that persist into winter.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. erythrocarpum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in upright clusters, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a two-valved samara with bright red wings that disperse by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. erythrocarpum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in temperate forests at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>The species is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. erythrocarpum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red autumn foliage and unique fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in temperate climates with a dormant winter and active growing season in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. erythrocarpum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers and produces edible berries that sustain small mammals and birds. This plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by enhancing soil fertility through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. erythrocarpum is a lesser-known plant with limited culinary use due to its small, tart berries that are not widely consumed.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, its leaves and bark have been used in some regions for their potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Industrially, it contributes to local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain indigenous communities, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more commonly studied plant species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. erythrocarpum has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Crimson King' being one of the most popular for its striking red foliage.</p>
<p>It is occasionally used in hybridization with other maple species, though its hybrids are less common than those of more widely cultivated maples. Due to its ornamental value, it holds horticultural importance in specialized gardens and collections. Its unique leaf coloration makes it a sought-after addition to landscape designs.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation remains relatively rare compared to other maple varieties.</p>
