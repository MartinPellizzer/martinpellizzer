                    <h1>Aldama hispida</h1>
<p>Aldama hispida, commonly known as the hairy aldama, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Aldama hispida is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
