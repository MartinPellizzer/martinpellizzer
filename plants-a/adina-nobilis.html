                <h1>Adina nobilis</h1>
<p>Adina nobilis, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of small, round fruits. Adina nobilis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various tropical and subtropical environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina nobilis has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina nobilis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Caribbean, though its distribution is less widespread there.</p>
<p>Adina nobilis is known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina nobilis was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It has also been reported in parts of Texas and the Caribbean islands. This plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Adina nobilis has become a common weed in these regions, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
