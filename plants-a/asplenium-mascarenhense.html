                    <h1>Asplenium mascarenhense</h1>
<p>Asplenium mascarenhense, commonly known as the Mascarene spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to tree trunks or rocks in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Asplenium mascarenhense is native to the Mascarene Islands, including Mauritius, Rodrigues, and RÃ©union, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
