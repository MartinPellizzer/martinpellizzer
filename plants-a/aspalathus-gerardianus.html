<p>Aspalathus gerardianus, commonly known as the sweet thorn, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is not as commercially significant as its relative, Aspalathus linearis, which is used in the production of rooibos tea.</p>
