<p>Aquilaria grandifolia, commonly known as the white sand aquilaria, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, aromatic fruits containing three to four seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fragrant properties, which can develop a rich, resinous scent when exposed to fungal infection.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is also of cultural and economic significance.</p>
