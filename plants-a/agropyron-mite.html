                    <h1>Agropyron mite</h1>
<p>Agropyron mite, commonly known as the wheat curl mite, is a microscopic arachnid belonging to the family Typhlodromidae.</p>
<p>It primarily feeds on grasses and is particularly associated with wheat and other cereal crops. The mite's life cycle includes several stages, with females laying eggs on the underside of leaves. These mites are known for their ability to transmit viruses, such as the wheat streak mosaic virus, which can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Their presence is often difficult to detect due to their small size, making them a challenging pest to manage in agricultural settings.</p>
