                    <h1>Anthogonium gracile</h1>
<p>Anthogonium gracile, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that form dense mats on the surface of water or damp soil. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to its substrate. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are typically clustered at the tips of the leaves.</p>
<p>Anthogonium gracile plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
