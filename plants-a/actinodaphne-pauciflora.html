                <h1>Actinodaphne pauciflora</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocados, and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it is often found in lowland to montane forests.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne pauciflora is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pauciflora has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that exudes a fragrant resin when cut, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, ovoid drupe with a smooth, dark brown exterior, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pauciflora is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This species thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing as an understory plant. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within the island's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in the local biodiversity and is part of the rich flora of Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pauciflora was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its fragrant leaves and attractive foliage. Its distribution has been expanded through horticultural trade and intentional planting in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
