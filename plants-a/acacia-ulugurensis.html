                        <h1>Acacia ulugurensis</h1>
<p>Acacia ulugurensis, commonly known as the Uluguru acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acacia ulugurensis plays a role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses by indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ulugurensis is primarily native to the dry savannas and grasslands of eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Mozambique. This species thrives in regions with low rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of the African savanna ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ulugurensis was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas and woodlands, often as a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded lands. This plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility and supporting other plant growth. It is also used for its hard, durable wood and as a source of food for livestock.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for reclamation and afforestation purposes.</p>
