                <h1>Achillea ambigua</h1>
<p>Achillea ambigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the Greek myth of Achilles, who was said to have used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ambigua has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a silvery-gray underside and a green upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ambigua is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>Although it was once found in the Himalayas, its current distribution is limited to scattered locations in northern India and western China. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is of concern.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve its natural habitat in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ambigua is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and delicate white to pink flowers, commonly found in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots in early spring, ensuring good drainage and light exposure. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
