                <h1>Achras salicifolia</h1>
<p>Achras salicifolia, commonly known as the silky paper plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Achras salicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras salicifolia has broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 10â€“20 cm long, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a tall, unbranched tree. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, fleshy capsule that splits open to release three seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras salicifolia is primarily native to the coastal areas of southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the regions of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dune ecosystems. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras salicifolia was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America and the Caribbean, where it has been cultivated in gardens and public spaces. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in landscaping because of its large, palm-like leaves. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, leading to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been primarily driven by its aesthetic value rather than agricultural or medicinal uses.</p>
