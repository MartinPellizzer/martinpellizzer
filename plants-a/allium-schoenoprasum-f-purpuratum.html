                    <h1>Allium schoenoprasum f. purpuratum</h1>
<p>Allium schoenoprasum f. purpuratum, commonly known as purple chives, is a botanical variant of the common chive.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its purple-tinted leaves and flowers, which distinguish it from the typical green variety. This plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in cool climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild garlic-like flavor.</p>
<p>The purple coloration is due to higher concentrations of anthocyanins in its foliage.</p>
