                    <h1>Arundarbor prava</h1>
<p>Arundarbor prava, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant has a complex root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong nighttime scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Arundarbor prava is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
