                <h1>Acosta pentelica</h1>
<p>Acosta pentelica, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Sierra Madre mountain ranges in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its thick, cork-like bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by hard, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing high tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Acosta pentelica is considered a critically endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pentelica has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow with four petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pentelica is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America, primarily found in countries such as Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific mountainous areas within its native range, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and open grasslands at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acosta pentelica is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acosta pentelica is a unique plant known for its delicate foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acosta pentelica spans several months, with flowering typically occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent but moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential for its health. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acosta pentelica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acosta pentelica contributes to ecological balance by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of its habitat.</p>
