                <h1>Acosta pentelica</h1>
<p>Acosta pentelica, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar vine-like growth patterns.</p>
<p>Acosta pentelica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pentelica has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pentelica is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in grasslands and rocky slopes within the Andes mountain range. It is adapted to the cool and often humid climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pentelica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of an ecological restoration project aimed at stabilizing degraded soils.</p>
<p>It was chosen for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, its invasive nature has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. The plant has since spread beyond its initial planting sites, particularly in coastal and riverine areas.</p>
<p>Monitoring and management strategies are now in place to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
