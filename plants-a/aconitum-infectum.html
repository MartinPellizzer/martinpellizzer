                <h1>Aconitum infectum</h1>
<p>Aconitum infectum, commonly known as the toxic aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant contains potent alkaloids, such as aconitine, which make it highly toxic to humans and animals. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a dangerous ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum infectum has large, doubly compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a bluish-green hue, growing in a straight, herbaceous pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are small and winged, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, providing storage for nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum infectum is primarily native to Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the state, particularly in the western and central areas. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. It is often seen growing in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its native range in Arizona reflects its adaptation to the specific ecological conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum infectum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous or hilly landscapes. The plant is commonly cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers. It prefers nutrient-rich soil and can tolerate moderate frost.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to several regions beyond its native habitat.</p>
