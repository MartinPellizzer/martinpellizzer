                <h1>Aconitum exaltatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum exaltatum, commonly known as the tall aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive silvery-white underside that reflects light.</p>
<p>Aconitum exaltatum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum exaltatum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 10â€“20 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps the plant survive in its alpine or woodland habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum exaltatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including countries such as Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in meadows, slopes, and rocky areas at high elevations. This plant is commonly associated with the Alps and the Pyrenees, where it grows in well-drained soils. It is also present in parts of the Balkans and extends into some areas of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for cooler climates, it is typically found in regions with a temperate to cold climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum exaltatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced primarily as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and tall, elegant appearance. This plant has since spread into natural areas, often colonizing moist, shaded environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native invasive species in several states within the region.</p>
