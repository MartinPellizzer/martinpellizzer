                <h1>Acmadenia harveiana</h1>
<p>Acmadenia harveiana, commonly known as the Harveian acmada, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Acmadenia harveiana is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia harveiana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a fragrant scent. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia harveiana is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in heathlands and open woodlands, particularly on sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often associated with sandplain and laterite substrates, and is a common component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Acmadenia harveiana is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native habitat, making it a resilient and characteristic species of the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia harveiana was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the eastern coast. This plant is often associated with heathlands and open forests. It is known for its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had a significant impact on local ecosystems due to its invasive nature.</p>
