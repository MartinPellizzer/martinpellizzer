<p>Atriplex lentiformis, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in saline and nutrient-poor soils. Its small greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Atriplex lentiformis plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
