<p>Achyrocline lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as achenes.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
