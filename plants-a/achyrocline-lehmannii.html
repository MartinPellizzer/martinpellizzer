<p>Achyrocline lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's Achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a head.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline lehmannii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline lehmannii is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivated areas in tropical and subtropical regions beyond its native range. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrocline lehmannii is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. The plant has a compact growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer with showy pink or purple flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
