                            <h1>Asplenium Dejectum</h1>
<p>Asplenium dejectum, commonly known as the drooping spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species is part of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often pendulous fronds. Found primarily in temperate regions, it often grows on rocks or soil in woodland areas. Its unique appearance and ability to colonize various substrates make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Despite its modest size, Asplenium dejectum plays a significant role in ecological systems.</p>
