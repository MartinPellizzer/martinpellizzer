                <h1>Actaea viridiflora</h1>
<p>Actaea viridiflora, commonly known as green-flowered bugbane, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is often noted for its vibrant green color, which contrasts with the pale flowers.</p>
<p>Actaea viridiflora is typically found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea viridiflora has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with serrated edges and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and greenish-yellow, with a somewhat hollow interior, and it grows upright with a single main stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, poisonous berry that contains seeds dispersed by animals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea viridiflora is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in areas with rich, loamy soil and moderate to cool climates. Its range extends from the northeastern United States down to the southeastern regions.</p>
<p>It is particularly prevalent in states such as Pennsylvania, New York, and parts of Ontario.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea viridiflora was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has been reported in several states across the eastern United States. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other introduced species.</p>
