                    <h1>Androsace chumbyi</h1>
<p>Androsace chumbyi, commonly known as the Chumby's rockweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense mat-forming growth habit, with small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Androsace chumbyi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
