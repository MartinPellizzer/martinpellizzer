<p>Artemisia dubia var. grata, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, narrow, and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
