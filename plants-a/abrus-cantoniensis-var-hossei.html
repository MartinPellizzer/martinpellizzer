                        <h1>Abrus cantoniensis var. hossei</h1>
<p>Abrus cantoniensis var. hossei, commonly known as the Chinese blood bean, is a climbing legume native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red, kidney-shaped seeds encased in a long, narrow pod. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets and produces showy, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous if ingested.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus cantoniensis var. hossei is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus cantoniensis var. hossei was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its striking red and black seed pods.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. The plant thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Although it is not considered invasive, it has the potential to spread in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystems.</p>
