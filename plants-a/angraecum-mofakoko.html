                    <h1>Angraecum mofakoko</h1>
<p>Angraecum mofakoko, commonly known as the Namibian star orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a single, broad, leathery leaf. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with long, slender petals and a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in arid conditions, relying on seasonal rainfall and symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
