<p>Asplenium × javorkae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>gibbonsiorum, commonly known as the Gibbons' shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
