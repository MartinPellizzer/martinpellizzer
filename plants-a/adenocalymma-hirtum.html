                <h1>Adenocalymma hirtum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma hirtum, commonly known as the hairy adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Adenocalymma hirtum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hirtum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, covered in fine hairs, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in racemes, featuring five pinkish-white petals and a prominent yellow stamen, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hirtum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil South.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, including states such as Pernambuco and Para√≠ba. It also occurs in the southern part of Brazil, particularly in the state of Santa Catarina. The species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to these specific regions within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hirtum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils, typically in coastal or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and requires well-drained soil conditions. This plant is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and cleared areas. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activity, including landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common invasive species in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
