                <h1>Acer lobulatum</h1>
<p>Acer lobulatum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 15-30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum has leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with lobed margins and a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green in summer and turning yellow to orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and reddish-brown, with a growth pattern that is primarily upright and shrub-like. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, with a simple structure consisting of four sepals and four petals, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and flat.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of these regions, though it is now considered rare and primarily found in specific habitats. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer lobulatum is listed as endangered in several areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer lobulatum involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it benefits from companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like clover or beans.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum is a native North American plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. Its dense growth acts as a companion plant, supporting biodiversity in forest ecosystems. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering habitat for small animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been historically used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, making it valuable for conservation efforts. Culturally, it is often admired for its vibrant autumn foliage, symbolizing seasonal change and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in landscaping and as a shade tree also enhances urban and rural environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant autumn color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer x pensylvanicum, which exhibit enhanced hardiness and ornamental traits. These varieties are widely cultivated in gardens and parks for their aesthetic value and adaptability to different climates. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to provide seasonal interest and its role in landscaping.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer lobulatum and its cultivars contribute significantly to the diversity of ornamental trees in horticulture.</p>
