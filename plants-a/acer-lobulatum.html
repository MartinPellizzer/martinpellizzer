                <h1>Acer lobulatum</h1>
<p>Acer lobulatum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in autumn. The tree produces small, red to green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 15â€“30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and urban environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a bright green upper surface that turns red or yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes during early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in moist, temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Acer lobulatum is considered endangered in some areas due to habitat fragmentation and threats from invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle of Acer lobulatum involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and promote health are essential for its development.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers in the spring. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small size and bitter taste, though its seeds may be used in traditional recipes in some regions.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, with some studies suggesting it may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, though it has minimal economic value compared to other maple species. Culturally, it is appreciated for its ornamental value, with its distinctive leaves making it a popular choice for landscaping.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the natural beauty of forest ecosystems and is often used in conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson Queen,' which are known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acer lobulatum have been developed to enhance traits such as disease resistance and adaptability to different climates. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, particularly in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal and hardiness make them valuable additions to both public and private gardens.</p>
