                <h1>Actaea bifida</h1>
<p>Actaea bifida, commonly known as the divided actaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound, fern-like leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its berries provide food for birds.</p>
<p>Actaea bifida is valued in gardens for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea bifida has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium in size, usually reaching up to 10 cm in length, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is smooth and slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat branched structure. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in upright clusters during late spring to early summer, with each flower having five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens; it is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several small seeds, which are dispersed primarily by birds eating the fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea bifida is primarily native to Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its distinctive, compound leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution in Korea is limited to specific ecological niches within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea bifida was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, including cultivation and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states across the eastern United States, particularly in woodland and moist habitats. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions. It is often found growing in shaded areas with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>However, its spread remains limited compared to other non-native species in the same ecosystem.</p>
