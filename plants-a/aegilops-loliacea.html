                <h1>Aegilops loliacea</h1>
<p>Aegilops loliacea, commonly known as goatgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Aegilops loliacea is sometimes considered a weed in crops but has also been studied for its potential in breeding programs for wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops loliacea has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually flat, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a light green to yellowish color, growing in a clump or loose cluster. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale blue to greenish flowers that bloom in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>
