<p>Asplenium horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil, and its fronds are usually broad and leathery. The plant has a compact rosette structure with tightly packed leaves that form a dense, mat-like appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium horizontale is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
