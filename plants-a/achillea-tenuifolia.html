                <h1>Achillea tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuifolia has linear, narrow leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, branched, and covered with fine hairs, growing from the base and reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind and insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuifolia is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky, and sandy soils in regions such as Spain and Portugal. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often seen growing in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends to some areas of southern France and northern Africa, including Morocco and Algeria.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuifolia was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, finely divided foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the western United States. This plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded significantly since its introduction, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
