<p>Actinodaphne microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne microphylla has small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a dense canopy.

<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas where the climate is warm and humid. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with limestone substrates. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections around the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne microphylla was mainly introduced to areas with humid, tropical climates where it can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, where it has become naturalized.
