                <h1>Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum, commonly known as the glossy-leaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy green leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, reaching heights of up to 6 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, measuring approximately 4–8 cm in length and 2–4 cm in width, and displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a rounded, upright form. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in upright clusters, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the plant produces these in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum is a variant of the field maple native to central and eastern Europe, including parts of Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in temperate climates, typically in open woodlands, forest edges, and disturbed soils. This species is commonly found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat degradation, it is considered a conservation concern and is listed as vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum is a compact, slow-growing ornamental tree known for its dense, rounded form and distinctive, glossy foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal traits. This species has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, and regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum is a valuable native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy white flowers. This plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil stability. Its deep roots help in erosion control by holding soil in place.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum is a decorative and hardy plant commonly used in landscaping and ornamental gardening for its attractive, smooth-textured leaves and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>While not typically used in culinary applications, it may be harvested for its young leaves in some traditional contexts. In medicinal use, it has been explored for its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to the ecosystem by supporting wildlife and improving soil quality.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often featured in regional botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum has several popular cultivars, including 'Erectum' and 'Tortum', which are prized for their unique foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also used in hybridization to create ornamental maples with enhanced traits such as brighter colors and improved hardiness. Hybrids involving this variety often combine the robustness of Acer campestre with the striking features of other maple species. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Due to these qualities, it remains a valuable addition to both public and private landscapes.</p>
