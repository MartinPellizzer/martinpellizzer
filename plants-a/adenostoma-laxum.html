                <h1>Adenostoma laxum</h1>
<p>Adenostoma laxum, commonly known as the coastal sagebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostoma laxum has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly pointed, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense coating of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, flaky bark that peels away in small patches, growing in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense terminal spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma laxum is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with sandy or rocky soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the coastal and inland valleys of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma laxum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as grazing, fire suppression, and land development.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common invader in coastal sage scrub and chaparral ecosystems. This plant has been reported in several states along the Pacific coast, including California and Oregon. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands can outcompete native vegetation, altering local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often targeted for control in ecological restoration projects.</p>
