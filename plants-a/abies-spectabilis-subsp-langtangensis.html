                        <h1>Abies spectabilis subsp. langtangensis</h1>
<p>Abies spectabilis subsp.</p>
<p>langtangensis, commonly known as the Langtang fir, is a rare subspecies native to the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and Tibet. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude regions, reaching heights of up to 30 meters.</p>
<p>The tree has slender, cylindrical cones and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing fissures with age.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold, moist environments and plays a significant ecological role in its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies spectabilis subsp.</p>
<p>langtangensis is primarily native to the Himalayas, specifically in Nepal and northern India. This subspecies is found in the Langtang Valley and surrounding mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It grows at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters above sea level. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the temperate forests in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies spectabilis subsp.</p>
<p>langtangensis was mainly introduced to specific high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and India. This subspecies is adapted to cold and moist environments, making it suitable for mountainous areas with high elevation.</p>
<p>It is often found in forests with dense canopy cover and well-drained soils. The introduction of this plant has been primarily for ecological restoration and afforestation projects.</p>
<p>Its presence contributes to biodiversity and helps stabilize soil in fragile mountain ecosystems.</p>
