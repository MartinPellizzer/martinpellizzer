                <h1>Adenia trilobata</h1>
<p>Adenia trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed adenium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, often reddish bark. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have three distinct lobes, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Adenia trilobata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia trilobata has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are usually 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to reddish in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind or through animal ingestion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia trilobata is primarily native to the Andaman Is., Assam, Bangladesh, East Himalaya, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or along stream banks. Adenia trilobata is known for its distinctive leaf structure and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans a wide range of geographic and ecological zones within South and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia trilobata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique and attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native habitats. The plant competes with indigenous species for resources, threatening local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
