                    <h1>Amomum calcicola</h1>
<p>Amomum calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola ginger, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic rhizomes and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important spices like ginger and turmeric. Amomum calcicola typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in forest understories where it receives limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is increasingly threatened with extinction in the wild.</p>
