                <h1>Adiantum cordifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum cordifolium, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the flowing hair of a maiden, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adiantum cordifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cordifolium has leaves that are heart-shaped (cordate), with a finely serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 10â€“20 cm long and wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, often appearing silvery due to the presence of trichomes. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and green, growing from a short rhizome. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds by wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, emerging from the stem and helping to anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cordifolium is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and stream sides. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate conditions with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cordifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive, delicate fronds and ability to thrive in partial shade. It has been introduced to several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas and is sometimes classified as invasive due to its rapid spread.</p>
