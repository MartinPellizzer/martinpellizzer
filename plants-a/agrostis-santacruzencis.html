                    <h1>Agrostis santacruzencis</h1>
<p>Agrostis santacruzencis, commonly known as Santa Cruz grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in restoration projects along coastal areas.</p>
