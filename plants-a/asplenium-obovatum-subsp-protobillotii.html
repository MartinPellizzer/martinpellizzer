<p>Asplenium obovatum subsp.</p>
<p>protobillotii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, obovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually clustered at the base, forming a dense, compact rosette. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
