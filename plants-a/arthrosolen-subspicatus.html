                    <h1>Arthrosolen subspicatus</h1>
<p>Arthrosolen subspicatus, commonly known as the spiked rockrose, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, branching stems covered in dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Arthrosolen subspicatus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
