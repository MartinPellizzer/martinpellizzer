<p>Anarthrophyllum ornithopodum, commonly known as the feather-footed lichen, is a member of the family Graphidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark, wood, or soil in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like lobes, which give it its common name. It has a pale to dark greenish-gray color and lacks a distinct medulla.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
