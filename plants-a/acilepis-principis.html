                <h1>Acilepis principis</h1>
<p>Acilepis principis, commonly known as the royal acilepis, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, adding a delicate beauty to its rugged habitat. Its growth is slow and it thrives in cool, shaded conditions, often found in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acilepis principis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis principis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbellate inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis principis is primarily native to Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in lowland areas with warm and humid climates. The plant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis principis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was likely brought as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability. The distribution includes regions such as Hawaii, Tahiti, and other tropical areas with similar climates. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native ecosystems, sometimes outcompeting local flora.</p>
<p>This plant is now considered an invasive species in some of the areas where it has taken root.</p>
