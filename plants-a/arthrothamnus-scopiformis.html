                    <h1>Arthrothamnus scopiformis</h1>
<p>Arthrothamnus scopiformis, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, blue-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its structure and morphology reflect evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>Arthrothamnus scopiformis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
