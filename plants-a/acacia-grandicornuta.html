                        <h1>Acacia grandicornuta</h1>
<p>Acacia grandicornuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in globular heads. Acacia grandicornuta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought resistance.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia grandicornuta is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with sandy or rocky soils. This species thrives in open woodlands, spinifex plains, and along riverbanks in its native habitat. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Acacia grandicornuta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia grandicornuta was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was also introduced to other regions in southern Africa for its potential in soil stabilization and as a source of timber. Despite its benefits, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to manage its distribution and mitigate its impact on native flora.</p>
