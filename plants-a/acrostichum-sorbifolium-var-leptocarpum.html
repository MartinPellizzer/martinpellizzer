                    <h1>Acrostichum sorbifolium var. leptocarpum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sorbifolium var. leptocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for reproduction through spores. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
