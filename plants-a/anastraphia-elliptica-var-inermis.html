The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is characterized by a glossy surface and a slightly succulent texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
