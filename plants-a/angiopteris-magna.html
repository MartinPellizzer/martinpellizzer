                    <h1>Angiopteris magna</h1>
<p>Angiopteris magna, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has large, floating fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, lobed shape. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and swamps. Its spores are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some cultures.</p>
