<p>Andryala pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>webbii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved andryala, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pinnately divided leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat, with features that aid in water retention and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaflets compared to the typical form of Andryala pinnatifida.</p>
