                    <h1>Acacia pteroclada</h1>
<p>Acacia pteroclada, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching habit and phyllodes that are narrow and often recurved. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are typically clustered at the ends of branches. Its bark is smooth and grayish, while its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species.</p>
<p>Acacia pteroclada is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
