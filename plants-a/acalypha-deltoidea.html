                <h1>Acalypha deltoidea</h1>
<p>Acalypha deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive deltoid-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks due to its preference for moist soil. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a spreading or upright form depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Acalypha deltoidea is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha deltoidea has leaves that are deltoid in shape, with a broad base and tapering tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green on the upper surface and lighter green or sometimes slightly pubescent on the underside. The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green or brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white bracts that often mimic leaves, and they bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with the seeds being tiny and winged for easy aerial transport.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha deltoidea is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is now also present in parts of India and has been introduced to other tropical regions. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of tropical rainforests. It typically occurs at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha deltoidea is a decorative shrub known for its vibrant, palmate leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and growing best in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilize it with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few months, and prune regularly to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>
