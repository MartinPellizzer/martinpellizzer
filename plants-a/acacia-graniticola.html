                    <h1>Acacia graniticola</h1>
<p>Acacia graniticola, commonly known as the granite acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deep underground. Its leaves are typically small and leathery, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Acacia graniticola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
