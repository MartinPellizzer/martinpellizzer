                            <h1>Arrhenatherum Hirtulum</h1>
<p>Hairy meadowgrass, scientifically known as Arrhenatherum hirtulum, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and hairy texture, which gives it its common name. This plant typically thrives in moist meadows and grasslands, often forming part of the vegetation in wetter habitats. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems. Hairy meadowgrass plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
