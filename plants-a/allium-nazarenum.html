                    <h1>Allium nazarenum</h1>
<p>Allium nazarenum, commonly known as the Nazarene garlic, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a garlic-like odor when the leaves are crushed, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Allium nazarenum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
