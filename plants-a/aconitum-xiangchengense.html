                <h1>Aconitum xiangchengense</h1>
<p>Aconitum xiangchengense, commonly known as the Xiangcheng monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive hood-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it requires careful handling and is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum xiangchengense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a dark brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a prominent central spadix, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum xiangchengense is primarily native to China, specifically the Xiangcheng region in the province of Henan.</p>
<p>This plant is found in mountainous areas with moist, temperate climates. It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with forested or alpine environments. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum xiangchengense was mainly introduced to China's mountainous regions, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for high-altitude environments. This plant is commonly found in forested areas and rocky slopes, where it benefits from partial shade and consistent moisture. Its introduction has contributed to the biodiversity of these regions, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, efforts are being made to promote its conservation and sustainable use.</p>
