<p>Apodanthera mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's apodanthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apodanthaceae, which is characterized by its unique parasitic relationship with certain trees. The plant is notable for its small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
