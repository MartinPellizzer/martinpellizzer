<p>Agropyron boreale subsp.</p>
<p>hyperarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and坚韧, enabling it to withstand harsh wind and frost conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing permafrost soils and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna.</p>
