<p>Achillea lingulata var. buglossis, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, gray-green leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny white to pale yellow florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and delicate flowers make it a valued addition to gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. buglossis has narrow, linear leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is generally clump-forming. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. buglossis is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in areas of Austria, France, Italy, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of North America, where it has been introduced and naturalized, especially in regions with similar climates. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>The species is considered of low conservation concern due to its ability to adapt to various environments and its presence in both native and introduced ranges.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. buglossis is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize sparingly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune back spent flowers to encourage re-blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
