                <h1>Acronema forrestii</h1>
<p>Acronema forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acronema forrestii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema forrestii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind due to their lack of showy petals. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema forrestii is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in regions of China, including provinces such as Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou. This plant typically grows in forested areas and mountainous regions with a humid climate. It is part of the Apiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Acronema forrestii is a relatively rare species, often found in specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema forrestii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in forest understories, where it competes with other shade-tolerant species. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of Southeast Asia, including China and Myanmar.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
