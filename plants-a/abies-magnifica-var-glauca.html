<p>Abies magnifica var. glauca, commonly known as the white fir, is a variant of the grand fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in both winter and summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical grand fir. It produces cones that are usually reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This evergreen tree thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
