<p>Aechmea guaratingensis, commonly known as the Guaran√≠ pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flower spikes that emerge from the leaf axils, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Aechmea guaratingensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
