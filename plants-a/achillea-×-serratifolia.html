                <h1>Achillea × serratifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea × serratifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated leaves and flat, clustered flower heads that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as meadows and rocky soils. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flowers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden planting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × serratifolia has compound, serrated leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are released in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × serratifolia is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in areas of the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>While it originally thrived in these regions, its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and botanical collections across temperate regions worldwide. It prefers well-drained soils in sunny, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin and limited natural range, it is considered a rare plant with a conservation status that is generally stable but requires monitoring in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × serratifolia is a hardy perennial known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a typical biennial growth cycle, producing flowers in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × serratifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>While it does not fix nitrogen, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil structure.</p>
