                <h1>Achillea squarrosa</h1>
<p>Achillea squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring silver-gray, aromatic leaves with a fuzzy texture. Its showy white to pale yellow flowers bloom in flat, circular clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea squarrosa has compound, serrated leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and alternate arrangement along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are hairy, reddish-brown in color, and have a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea squarrosa is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was historically widespread, its current distribution is more restricted, with populations mainly found in isolated areas of Spain and Portugal. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone soils and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea squarrosa is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that begins with new shoots in spring, flowering in late summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea squarrosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its pest-repelling properties. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its environment.</p>
