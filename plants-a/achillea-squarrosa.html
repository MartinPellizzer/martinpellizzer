                <h1>Achillea squarrosa</h1>
<p>Achillea squarrosa, commonly known as the square-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces flat, clustered flower heads composed of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are linear, serrated, and covered in a layer of fine, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea squarrosa has leaves that are gray-green, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a woolly texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea squarrosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry, sunny habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and wastelands. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with Mediterranean shrublands and maquis vegetation. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and its ability to tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several countries, including Spain, Portugal, Italy, and parts of Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea squarrosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage and pale yellow flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, often thriving in disturbed soils and open fields. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent its unintended spread.</p>
