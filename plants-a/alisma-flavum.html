                    <h1>Alisma flavum</h1>
<p>Alisma flavum, commonly known as yellow waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette and are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in water-saturated soils, and it is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Alisma flavum is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and is also used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
