                <h1>Adenia tuberifera</h1>
<p>Adenia tuberifera, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody structure and tuberous roots. The plant produces large, showy flowers with five petals and a distinctive crown of filaments. Its fruit is a fleshy, edible berry that contains numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia tuberifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some African cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia tuberifera has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and serve as storage organs, helping the plant survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia tuberifera is primarily native to Zambia.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests. It is commonly associated with riverine habitats and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Zambia's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia tuberifera was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the North Island, particularly in the Bay of Plenty and lower North Island regions. The plant thrives in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
