<p>Athyrium ophiodontum, commonly known as the snake's head fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
