                        <h1>Acalypha anisodonta</h1>
<p>Acalypha anisodonta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a garden plant.</p>
<p>Acalypha anisodonta is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha anisodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is often associated with rainforests and secondary vegetation. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to humid climates with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha anisodonta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it common in regions with warm temperatures and moderate to high rainfall. The plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to establish itself in nutrient-poor soils. It is often considered an invasive species in parts of its introduced range due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native habitat, posing challenges to local ecosystems in some regions.</p>
