                        <h1>Acantholimon majewianum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon majewianum, commonly known as the Majewski's thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in steppes and semi-deserts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
