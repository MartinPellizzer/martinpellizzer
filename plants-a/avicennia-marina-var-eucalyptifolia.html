                    <h1>Avicennia marina var. eucalyptifolia</h1>
<p>Avicennia marina var. eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the mangrove with eucalyptus-like leaves, is a variant of the gray mangrove.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as tidal mudflats and estuaries. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air.</p>
<p>It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
