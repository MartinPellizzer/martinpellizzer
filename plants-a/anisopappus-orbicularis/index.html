                            <h1>Anisopappus Orbicularis</h1>
<p>Orbicular groundsel, scientifically known as Anisopappus orbicularis, is a rare and unique plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive orb-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This species is adapted to arid environments and thrives in rocky soils with minimal water. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable plant species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this fascinating and ecologically important flora.</p>
