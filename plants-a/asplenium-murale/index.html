                            <h1>Asplenium Murale</h1>
<p>Asplenium murale, commonly known as the wall fern, is a hardy and adaptable plant often found growing on rocky surfaces and walls. This evergreen fern is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that can reach several inches in length. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for indoor cultivation. Its ability to cling to surfaces makes it a popular choice for vertical gardening and rockeries. Despite its small size, Asplenium murale plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
