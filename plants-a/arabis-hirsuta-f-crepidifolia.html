                    <h1>Arabis hirsuta f. crepidifolia</h1>
<p>Arabis hirsuta f. crepidifolia, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are hairy and often have a wrinkled texture, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to rocky or gravelly habitats in Europe and is adapted to well-drained soils. Its foliage and flowers are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader, more lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Arabis hirsuta.</p>
