                <h1>Acosta biebersteinii</h1>
<p>Acosta biebersteinii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acosta biebersteinii is often found in desert scrublands and is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta biebersteinii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a creeping growth pattern that often forms dense mats. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta biebersteinii is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is typically found in high-altitude environments, including grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates and is often associated with mountainous habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>
<p>Acosta biebersteinii is an endemic species, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta biebersteinii was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, characterized by mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or rocky slopes. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its delicate, fragrant flowers. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including California and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
