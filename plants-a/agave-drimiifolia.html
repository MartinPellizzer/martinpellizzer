                    <h1>Agave drimiifolia</h1>
<p>Agave drimiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves. The leaves are narrow and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces tall flower stalks that bear clusters of small, white flowers, typically blooming once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
