<p>Anemonastrum polyanthes, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum polyanthes is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
