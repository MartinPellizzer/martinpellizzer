                <h1>Acourtia moctezumae</h1>
<p>Acourtia moctezumae, commonly known as the Mexican daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often found in rocky or limestone habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Acourtia moctezumae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia moctezumae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia moctezumae is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí, and Tamaulipas. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in limestone soils. The species is adapted to the semi-desert and desert climates of this region.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and is typically found in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia moctezumae was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there for ornamental purposes due to its striking yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden environments. However, it has been classified as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
