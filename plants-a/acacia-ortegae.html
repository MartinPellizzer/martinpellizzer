<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces flat, leathery pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia ortegae is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
