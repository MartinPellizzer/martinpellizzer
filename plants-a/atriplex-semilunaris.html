<p>Atriplex semilunaris, commonly known as the silverleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Atriplex semilunaris is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
