                    <h1>Arenaria lapponica</h1>
<p>Arenaria lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh environments make it a characteristic species of tundra and mountain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Arenaria lapponica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats.</p>
