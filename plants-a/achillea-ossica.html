                <h1>Achillea ossica</h1>
<p>Achillea ossica, commonly known as the Armenian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with silver-gray, hairy foliage and flat, white or pale yellow flower clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea ossica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ossica has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing directly from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ossica is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>Currently, it is distributed across countries such as Italy, Spain, Morocco, and Algeria. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats like grasslands and slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ossica is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and resilience in various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in warmer regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after blooming helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its ornamental value and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea ossica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring flora by improving soil conditions and enhancing ecological balance. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it effective in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea ossica offers ecological benefits by contributing to habitat creation and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>
