                <h1>Achillea ossica</h1>
<p>Achillea ossica, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and gray-green in color, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Achillea ossica is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ossica has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ossica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Balkan Peninsula, including parts of Greece, Albania, and southern Italy.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often seen growing in open areas with full sun exposure. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is relatively rare and can be found in specific, localized areas within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ossica was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other parts of Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain regions.</p>
