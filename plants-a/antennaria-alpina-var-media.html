                    <h1>Antennaria alpina var. media</h1>
<p>Antennaria alpina var. media, commonly known as the Alpine Bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are often tinged with purple or red at the base.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to rocky soils and high altitudes, making it a hardy species found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
