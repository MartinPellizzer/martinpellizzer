<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often toxic compounds. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or ascending, with hairy stems that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes ancistrophora has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
