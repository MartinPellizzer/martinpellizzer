<p>Alsophila hypolampra, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Alsophila hypolampra plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
