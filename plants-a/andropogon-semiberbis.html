<p>Andropogon semiberbis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually green to pale blue in color. Its root system is fibrous and helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its habitat.</p>
<p>Narrowleaf bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
