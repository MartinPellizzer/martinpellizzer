                <h1>Aechmea platyphylla</h1>
<p>Aechmea platyphylla, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, often followed by small, showy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea platyphylla has leaves that are broad, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy, dark green surface and a pale blue underside.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick base covered in dense, fibrous roots. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of yellow and red, and bloom during the summer months, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
