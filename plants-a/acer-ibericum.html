                <h1>Acer ibericum</h1>
<p>Acer ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ibericum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ibericum is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, specifically spanning parts of southern Italy, Albania, and the western Balkans.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has been largely restricted due to habitat loss and fragmentation, with the species now found primarily in isolated pockets within its former range. It thrives in temperate climates, growing in rocky or forested areas with well-drained soils. Acer ibericum typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, often in mixed deciduous forests or on mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and declining population, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ibericum is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining specific cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Acer ibericum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in early summer and leaf drop in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and remove dead wood.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and is often planted with other ornamental shrubs for aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ibericum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its colorful flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its roots.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>
