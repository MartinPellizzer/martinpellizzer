<p>It typically grows to a height of 8â€“12 meters and has a rounded, often multi-stemmed crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven segments, and are usually bright green during the growing season. In autumn, the foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange, making it a striking ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ibericum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a serrated margin, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky or poor soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ibericum is a species of maple native to the eastern Mediterranean region, primarily found in countries such as Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southeastern Europe and the Near East, although its range has become fragmented due to habitat loss. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in mountainous areas. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activities, Acer ibericum is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ibericum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer ibericum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or flowers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ibericum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
