                <h1>Adiantum cajennense</h1>
<p>Adiantum cajennense, commonly known as the Jamaican maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, arching shape, with the pinnae often curving backward.</p>
<p>Adiantum cajennense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cajennense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, and have a bright green color that may turn bronze or reddish in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, with a structure consisting of separate stamens and pistils.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cajennense is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is often seen in humid lowland areas with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans a wide range of South American countries, reflecting its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cajennense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the United States, especially in Florida, Hawaii, and California. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its delicate, fern-like foliage. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and accidental spread.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
