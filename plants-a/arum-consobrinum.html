                    <h1>Arum consobrinum</h1>
<p>Arum consobrinum, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking, spadix-bearing inflorescences surrounded by a showy spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomes are edible and have been traditionally used as a starch source.</p>
<p>However, the plant contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation if ingested raw.</p>
