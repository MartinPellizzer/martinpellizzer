                <h1>Acer × peronai</h1>
<p>Acer × peronai, commonly known as the hybrid maple, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between *Acer rubrum* (red maple) and *Acer negundo* (box elder).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with slender, often drooping branches and palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and is known for its rapid growth rate. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × peronai has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green color during the growing season and a vibrant yellow or orange in autumn; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and are yellow-green in color, blooming in early spring; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind; the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × peronai is a hybrid maple species that originated from the natural cross between *Acer negundo* and *Acer sachalinense*.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern part of Asia, specifically Japan and the Korean Peninsula. Currently, it is widely cultivated in temperate regions around the world, including North America and Europe, often as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, typically found in forested areas.</p>
<p>It is generally found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters and is considered a non-threatened species with a stable conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × peronai is a hybrid maple known for its vibrant fall foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable and faster method. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with a moderate growth rate that makes it suitable for smaller gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide a natural habitat for beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × peronai is a hybrid maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and provides nectar and pollen. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant, offering shade and habitat in mixed forest ecosystems. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality, enhancing overall ecological balance.</p>
