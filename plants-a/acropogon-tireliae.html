                <h1>Acropogon tireliae</h1>
<p>Acropogon tireliae, commonly known as the Tiresia grass, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Acropogon tireliae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropogon tireliae has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon tireliae is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and coastal areas. Acropogon tireliae is an endemic species, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Caledonia's unique ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon tireliae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes. Its introduction has been linked to human activities, including agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
