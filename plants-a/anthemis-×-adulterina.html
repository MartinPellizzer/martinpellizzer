                    <h1>Anthemis × adulterina</h1>
<p>Anthemis × adulterina, commonly known as the hybrid ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is a natural hybrid between Anthemis cotula and Anthemis tinctoria, exhibiting traits from both parent species.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated but requires careful management.</p>
