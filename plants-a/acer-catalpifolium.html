                    <h1>Acer catalpifolium</h1>
<p>Acer catalpifolium, commonly known as the Catalpa-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the catalpa tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
