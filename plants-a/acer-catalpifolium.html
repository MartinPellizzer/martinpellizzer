                <h1>Acer catalpifolium</h1>
<p>Acer catalpifolium, commonly known as the Catalpa-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the catalpa tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium has leaves that are ovate to broadly ovate in shape, with a coarsely toothed margin, alternate arrangement, and a moderate size of about 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in cymes, and bloom in late spring; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a samara, with two papery wings, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is severely restricted, with only a few known populations remaining in isolated areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within temperate forests, typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique tree species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium is a deciduous tree native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer catalpifolium involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions, and it pairs well with companion plants like ferns and hostas in shaded gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination network. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer catalpifolium supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different life stages of various organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may have minor use in traditional herbal remedies. The tree's wood is valued for its fine grain and is used in small-scale woodworking and furniture-making. It holds cultural significance in Chinese horticulture and is often planted in gardens for aesthetic purposes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Carnegie' and 'Coral Sunset', which are known for their vibrant fall color and distinctive foliage. Hybrids of Acer catalpifolium are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance and growth habits. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, particularly in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them a popular choice for ornamental planting in temperate climates.</p>
