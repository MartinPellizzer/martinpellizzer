The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seed capsules that release seeds with silky filaments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to withstand drought conditions once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon leucanthemum has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 3–6 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat hairy, and have a pale green to yellowish bark, growing upright with a bushy appearance. The flowers are showy, with five petals forming a bell shape, and are typically yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a 3-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon leucanthemum is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of Oregon and Arizona, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. This species thrives in dry, rocky environments and is commonly found in chaparral and scrub habitats. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat degradation, Abutilon leucanthemum is listed as a threatened species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon leucanthemum is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and ornamental value in gardens.</p>
