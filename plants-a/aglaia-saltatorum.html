<p>Aglaia saltatorum, commonly known as the jumping bean tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk. Its unique name comes from the way its fruit resembles a jumping bean, which is a phenomenon caused by the movement of the larvae inside the husk.</p>
<p>Aglaia saltatorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures.</p>
