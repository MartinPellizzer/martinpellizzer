                    <h1>Arachniodes menglianensis</h1>
<p>Arachniodes menglianensis, commonly known as the Menglian fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
