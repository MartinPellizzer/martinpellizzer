                <h1>Adenopus longiflorus</h1>
<p>Adenopus longiflorus, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by green bracts.</p>
<p>Adenopus longiflorus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopus longiflorus has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus longiflorus is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the eastern and southeastern regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal areas of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal forests and sandstone formations. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the mild, temperate climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenopus longiflorus is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus longiflorus was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soil, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in open spaces such as gardens, parks, and along roadsides where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and long, showy inflorescences. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, though it can sometimes become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Careful management is recommended to prevent it from spreading beyond controlled areas.</p>
