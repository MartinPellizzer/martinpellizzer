                <h1>Adina orientalis</h1>
<p>Adina orientalis, commonly known as the oriental adina, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenia plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Adina orientalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina orientalis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 3 to 8 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release one or two smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina orientalis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with forest understories and is widely distributed across the Indian subcontinent. It is also present in parts of East Asia, including the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Adina orientalis is well adapted to humid climates and thrives in areas with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina orientalis was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and Texas.</p>
<p>It has been documented in wetland and disturbed areas, often along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is largely attributed to human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in providing habitat for certain wildlife species.</p>
