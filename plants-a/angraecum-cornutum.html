                    <h1>Angraecum cornutum</h1>
<p>Angraecum cornutum, commonly known as the horned angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral spurs that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, a feature that aids in pollination by specialized moths. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Angraecum cornutum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
