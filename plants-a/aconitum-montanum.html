                <h1>Aconitum montanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum montanum, commonly known as the mountain monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking purple or blue flowers in late summer, arranged in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, waxy appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum montanum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum montanum has leaves that are compound, with palmately arranged leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, medium to large in size, and typically have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, often hairy, and has a rough, bark that is grayish-brown in color. The flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem, with showy spurred petals and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, aiding in the plant's survival in rocky or alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum montanum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. This plant is commonly found in meadows, forest edges, and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of these regions, showing resilience to cold temperatures and limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of these mountainous habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum montanum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. This plant is commonly used in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers and can be grown as an ornamental. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
