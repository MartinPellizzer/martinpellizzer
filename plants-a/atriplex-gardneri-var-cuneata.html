                    <h1>Atriplex gardneri var. cuneata</h1>
<p>Atriplex gardneri var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of salt glands, which help it tolerate high salinity and drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, and it is often found growing in sandy or saline soils. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
