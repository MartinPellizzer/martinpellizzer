                    <h1>Alsophila subglandulosa</h1>
<p>Alsophila subglandulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer of old fronds. The plant produces a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its spores are borne on the undersides of the fertile fronds, which are typically found at the tips of the plant.</p>
<p>Alsophila subglandulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
