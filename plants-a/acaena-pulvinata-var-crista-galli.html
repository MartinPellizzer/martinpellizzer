<p>Acaena pulvinata var. crista-galli, commonly known as the "crown-of-thorns" or "thorned burr," is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiky, burr-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes used as a hedging plant or in erosion control.</p>
