<p>Agrostis canina var. spiculis-majoribus, commonly known as the tall spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it its botanical name. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
