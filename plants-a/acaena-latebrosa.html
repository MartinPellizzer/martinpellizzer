Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and their relatives, known for their unique morphology and primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by a variety of flower structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Rosales, a group of flowering plants that includes roses, strawberries, and other economically significant plants, known for their diverse floral structures. Its family is Rosaceae, commonly known as the rose family, which includes a wide range of plants such as roses, apples, and raspberries, characterized by their distinctive flowers and fruits. Its genus is Acaena, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "burnet" or "burr weeds," typically found in temperate regions and characterized by their spiny fruits.</p>
<p>Its species is Acaena latebrosa, a specific plant within the Acaena genus, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena latebrosa is primarily native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique biodiversity and Mediterranean climate. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Acaena latebrosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various local wildlife species.</p>
