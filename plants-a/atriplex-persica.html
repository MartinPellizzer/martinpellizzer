                    <h1>Atriplex persica</h1>
<p>Atriplex persica, commonly known as Persian saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to saline soils and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Atriplex persica is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils in degraded areas.</p>
