                <h1>Adnaria angulata</h1>
<p>Adnaria angulata, commonly known as the angular adnara, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its angular, often thorny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments.</p>
<p>Adnaria angulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria angulata has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color and exhibits a branched growth pattern. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and serve to anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria angulata is primarily native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea, including southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, brackish waters and is commonly found in estuaries and lagoons. This species is also present in some areas of the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited to specific environmental conditions, making it a regionally restricted species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria angulata was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, sheltered areas with moderate salinity, often near mangrove forests and estuaries. The plant has been observed spreading along shorelines, where it forms dense mats that can alter local ecosystems. Its introduction is believed to be due to both natural dispersal via water currents and human activities such as aquaculture and coastal development.</p>
<p>Adnaria angulata has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and affecting biodiversity.</p>
