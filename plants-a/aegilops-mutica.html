                <h1>Aegilops mutica</h1>
<p>Aegilops mutica, commonly known as the rough goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with lemmas that are usually rough to the touch.</p>
<p>Aegilops mutica is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops mutica has narrow, linear leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 2-4 mm wide, with a slightly hairy surface and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, slightly hairy texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which bloom in early summer and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, triangular seeds through mechanical means.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in dry, sandy soils.</p>
