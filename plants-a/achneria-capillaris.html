                <h1>Achneria capillaris</h1>
<p>Achneria capillaris, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found along stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria capillaris has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria capillaris is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant is also present in parts of eastern Mexico, including the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. It is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats within its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria capillaris was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. It has become naturalized in some areas, leading to its establishment in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
