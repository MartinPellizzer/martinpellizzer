<p>Asplenium × contrei, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in compact, upright clusters.</p>
<p>Asplenium × contrei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
