                    <h1>Antennaria pedicellata</h1>
<p>Antennaria pedicellata, commonly known as the hooked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features a cushion-like growth form with dense, mat-forming stems that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Antennaria pedicellata is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
