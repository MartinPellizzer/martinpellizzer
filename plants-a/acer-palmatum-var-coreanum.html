<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. coreanum is a variant of the Japanese maple native to the mountainous regions of southern Korea.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of the Korean Peninsula, particularly in the southeastern and central regions. Currently, it is also found in cultivation in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. coreanum is a decorative, compact maple known for its delicate, fern-like leaves and vibrant seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with ferns, hostas, and other shade-loving plants in a woodland garden.</p>
