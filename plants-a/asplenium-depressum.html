                    <h1>Asplenium depressum</h1>
<p>Asplenium depressum, commonly known as the crested maidenhair, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, dark green, fan-shaped fronds that are typically curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Asplenium depressum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
