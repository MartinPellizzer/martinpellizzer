                    <h1>Acacia pachyloma</h1>
<p>Acacia pachyloma, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia pachyloma is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
