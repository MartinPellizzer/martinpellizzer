                    <h1>Actinopappus</h1>
<p>Actinopappus, commonly known as the "feathered achene," is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>Its most distinctive botanical feature is the presence of pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal of the seeds. The pappus is composed of bristles or scales that radiate from the base of the achene, giving it a unique appearance. These structures are adapted for efficient seed dispersal, allowing the plant to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Actinopappus species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where their drought-resistant traits provide a survival advantage.</p>
