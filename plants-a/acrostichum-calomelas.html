                <h1>Acrostichum calomelas</h1>
<p>Acrostichum calomelas, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the coastal regions of the Americas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in salty conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it a key component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum calomelas has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum calomelas is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas and wetlands. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in parts of Papua New Guinea and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Acrostichum calomelas is well adapted to brackish water conditions and plays an important role in coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum calomelas was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it can thrive in saline and waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant has been reported in several tropical and subtropical countries, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some ecosystems.</p>
