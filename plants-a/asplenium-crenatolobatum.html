<p>Asplenium crenatolobatum, commonly known as the notched-lobed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>Asplenium crenatolobatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
