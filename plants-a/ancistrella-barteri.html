<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
