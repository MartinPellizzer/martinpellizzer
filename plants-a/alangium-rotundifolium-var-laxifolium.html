<p>Alangium rotundifolium var. laxifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alangium, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The leaves and fruits have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
