                <h1>Acinodendron eriocladum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron eriocladum, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its leaves are typically alternate and pinnate, with small, rounded leaflets.</p>
<p>Acinodendron eriocladum is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eriocladum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exhibits a slight ridged texture. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and a central cluster of stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eriocladum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is limited to these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eriocladum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in wetland and riparian habitats. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about ecological disruption and biodiversity loss.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its population and prevent further spread.</p>
