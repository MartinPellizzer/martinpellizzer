                    <h1>Arabis divaricarpa var. stenocarpa</h1>
<p>Arabis divaricarpa var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The narrow, elongated fruits of this variety distinguish it from other members of the species.</p>
