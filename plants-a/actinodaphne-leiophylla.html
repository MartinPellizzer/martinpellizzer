                <h1>Actinodaphne leiophylla</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leafed camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. It produces small, fragrant flowers and is valued for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its essential oils and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne leiophylla has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with smooth, pale brown bark that remains relatively uniform in texture throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing primarily through bird consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne leiophylla is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne leiophylla was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments make it a desirable species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats due to its tolerance to varying soil conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its fragrant leaves and potential medicinal properties. Its introduction has led to its presence in several island nations in the Pacific and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains a subject of ongoing ecological study.</p>
