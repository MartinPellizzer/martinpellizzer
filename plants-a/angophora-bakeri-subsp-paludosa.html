<p>Angophora bakeri subsp.</p>
<p>paludosa, commonly known as the swamp angophora, is a shrub or small tree native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, dark grey to black bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, swampy soils and is adapted to periodic flooding, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species in some regions.</p>
