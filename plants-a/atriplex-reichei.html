<p>Atriplex reichei, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, salt-tolerant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex reichei plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
