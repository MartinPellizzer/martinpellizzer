<p>Amphirhapis rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinct, slender, reddish stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique appearance. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically borne on separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Amphirhapis rubricaulis is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
