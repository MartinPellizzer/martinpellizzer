<p>Asplenium potosinum, commonly known as the Potosi spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the humid seasons.</p>
<p>Asplenium potosinum is a relatively rare species, often found in specific geographic regions within Central America.</p>
