                <h1>Achrouteria durifructa</h1>
<p>Achrouteria durifructa, commonly known as the hard-fruited achrouteria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a hard, woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Achrouteria durifructa is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achrouteria durifructa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a creeping manner along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achrouteria durifructa is primarily native to Brazil North and French Guiana.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforest regions of these areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense canopy of the forest. The plant is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions in South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achrouteria durifructa was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Mediterranean region due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has been widely planted in gardens and parks for its striking blue flowers and drought tolerance. However, its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to concerns about its invasive potential in native ecosystems. Despite its beauty, the plant is now considered a weed in some areas, outcompeting local flora.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread while balancing its aesthetic and ecological impacts.</p>
