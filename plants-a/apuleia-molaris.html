<p>Apuleia molaris, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Apuleia molaris is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly sought after in the musical instrument and furniture industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
