                <h1>Adicea sanctae-crucis</h1>
<p>Adicea sanctae-crucis, commonly known as the Crucifixion Plant, is a rare and unique species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae, characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble a crucifix. The plant features smooth, dark green leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the island's Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea sanctae-crucis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern, with a light green to brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, bloom from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea sanctae-crucis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests. It is often associated with limestone substrates and can be found in montane regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea sanctae-crucis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and forested areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species.</p>
