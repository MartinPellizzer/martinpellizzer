                <h1>Acinodendron fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in small, woody pods, and the plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Acinodendron fasciculatum is often used in traditional medicine and for its hard, durable wood.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron fasciculatum has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron fasciculatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with evergreen forests. It is not native to any other continent and is primarily distributed within the Indomalayan region.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is rarely found outside of these native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron fasciculatum was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, making it common in areas such as Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and the Caribbean. The plant is typically found in shaded or semi-shaded areas, often growing in secondary forests or disturbed habitats. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in new regions, where it can compete with native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
