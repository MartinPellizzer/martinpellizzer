<p>Cinnamon fern, scientifically known as Aspidium aculeatum var. subtripinnatum, is a striking member of the fern family that captivates with its unique appearance. Native to wetlands and shaded areas, this plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments across North America. Its feathery fronds, resembling cinnamon sticks, give it its common name and make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Despite its delicate look, the cinnamon fern is resilient and adaptable, making it a hardy addition to many landscapes. With its elegant form and ecological benefits, it plays an important role in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
