                <h1>Aegiphila latifolia</h1>
<p>Aegiphila latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila latifolia has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth when young and develops fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a pale yellow color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils in dry environments.</p>
