                <h1>Aegilops calida</h1>
<p>Aegilops calida, commonly known as the warm grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to brownish flowers. Aegilops calida is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal areas and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops calida has narrow, linear leaves that are grass-like in appearance, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly upright. The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to white florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
