                    <h1>Asplenium × rouxii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × rouxii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, shield-like structures called "sporangia.". The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and while it does not produce viable spores, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Asplenium × rouxii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
