                    <h1>Alnus × hybrida var. pomeranica</h1>
<p>Alnus × hybrida var. pomeranica, commonly known as the European white elm, is a hybrid species within the genus Alnus, characterized by its fast growth and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It typically features a broad, spreading crown with elongated, slightly twisted leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, pendulous catkins in early spring, which are male and female, contributing to its role as a wind-pollinated species. It is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
<p>Its wood is soft and lightweight, historically used for construction and furniture.</p>
