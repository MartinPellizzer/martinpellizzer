                    <h1>Azorella hydrocotylifolia</h1>
<p>Azorella hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette structure.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andes Mountains of southern Chile and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate it from extreme temperatures. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Azorella hydrocotylifolia is also known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
