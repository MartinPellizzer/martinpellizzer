<p>Allium brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegge onion, is a rare and striking plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs at the base of its stems, which are similar in appearance to those of other Allium species. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium brandegeei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
