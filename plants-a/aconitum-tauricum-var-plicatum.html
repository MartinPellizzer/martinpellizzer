                    <h1>Aconitum tauricum var. plicatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum tauricum var. plicatum, commonly known as the wrinkled taurian monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a raceme, with large, hooded petals that resemble a monk's habit. The plant has palmate leaves with a deeply lobed structure, and its stems are typically hairy. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle.</p>
