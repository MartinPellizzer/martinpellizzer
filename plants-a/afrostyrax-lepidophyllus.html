                    <h1>Afrostyrax lepidophyllus</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Afr√∂styrax lepidophyllus, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of liverwort that can survive extreme desiccation.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to curl into a compact, desiccated form when dry and then "resurrect" when exposed to moisture. This plant is native to arid regions of Australia and is often found in rocky crevices or sandy soils. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and tightly packed, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant's remarkable resilience makes it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
