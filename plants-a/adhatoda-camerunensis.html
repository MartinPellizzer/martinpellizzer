<p>Adhatoda camerunensis, commonly known as African Trumpet or Cameroun Trumpet, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Adhatoda camerunensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional medicinal uses in some African communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda camerunensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching profusely. The flowers are tubular, with a violet-blue color, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in the plant's anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>

<p>Adhatoda camerunensis is primarily native to Central and West Africa, including countries such as Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid lowland areas with rich soil. The plant is commonly associated with secondary forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and wet climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adhatoda camerunensis is an important component of the local flora and has traditional medicinal uses in the regions where it is found.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda camerunensis was mainly introduced to areas with humid climates and fertile soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high rainfall and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in regions like parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties, which has contributed to its introduction in new regions. Its adaptability to different soil types has allowed it to spread beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has also raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
