                    <h1>Arctous alpina</h1>
<p>Arctous alpina, commonly known as the alpine arctous, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Arctous alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where few other plants can survive.</p>
