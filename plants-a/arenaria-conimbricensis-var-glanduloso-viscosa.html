<p>Arenaria conimbricensis var. glanduloso-viscosa, commonly known as the Portuguese sandwort, is a rare and endemic plant native to Portugal.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has glandular and viscid (sticky) leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
