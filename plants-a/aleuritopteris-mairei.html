                    <h1>Aleuritopteris mairei</h1>
<p>Aleuritopteris mairei, commonly known as the Maire's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize wetlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
