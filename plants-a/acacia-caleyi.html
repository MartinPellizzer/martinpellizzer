                    <h1>Acacia caleyi</h1>
<p>Acacia caleyi, commonly known as the white-flowered acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Acacia caleyi is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals.</p>
