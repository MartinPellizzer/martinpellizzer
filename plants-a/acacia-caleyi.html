                        <h1>Acacia caleyi</h1>
<p>Acacia caleyi, commonly known as the white-flowered acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Acacia caleyi is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia caleyi is primarily native to the dry savannas and rocky areas of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on sandy or gravelly soils. This species is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of the local flora. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia caleyi is commonly seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia caleyi was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical or subtropical climate, characterized by warm temperatures and seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or savanna habitats. This plant is commonly introduced for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has also been used in reforestation projects because of its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
