                <h1>Acer longipes var. nanchuanense</h1>
<p>Acer longipes var. nanchuanense, commonly known as the Nanchuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. nanchuanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning red or orange in autumn. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a regular growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two papery wings, dispersing by wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. nanchuanense is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Sichuan and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few fragmented areas within its native range due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in humid, temperate forests with well-drained soil and partial shade. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer longipes var. nanchuanense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. nanchuanense is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, making it ideal for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its visual appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. nanchuanense is a unique plant that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. This plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the surrounding area. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing land degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and sustenance to a variety of animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. nanchuanense is a lesser-known plant species primarily found in China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential in traditional medicine for its bioactive compounds. Its role in local ecosystems supports biodiversity and provides habitat for various organisms. Although not extensively utilized in industrial or economic sectors, it contributes to the cultural heritage of regions where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited research, its full range of applications remains underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. nanchuanense has a limited number of recognized varieties, with its natural form being the primary focus of horticultural interest.</p>
<p>Among its popular cultivars, 'Carnegie' and 'Twin Peaks' are widely appreciated for their striking red foliage and compact growth habits. While few hybrids have been developed specifically from this variety, some crosses with other maple species have produced ornamental forms with enhanced coloration. Its horticultural importance lies in its unique leaf morphology and autumn color, making it a sought-after specimen for specialized gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it remains a valuable addition to the collection of enthusiasts and botanic gardens.</p>
