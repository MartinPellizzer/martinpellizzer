                        <h1>Acanthophyllum luteum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum luteum, commonly known as the yellow burrobrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep root systems and small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its growth habit forms low, cushion-like mounds, which help it resist wind and conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum luteum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
