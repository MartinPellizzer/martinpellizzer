<p>Abarema arborescens, commonly known as the tree legume or Brazilian tree legume, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abarema arborescens has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, typically measuring between 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a pod-like legume containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema arborescens is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly found in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Amazon Basin and the Chaco region, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. It typically grows in environments with rich, well-drained soils, often in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Abarema arborescens is found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>
