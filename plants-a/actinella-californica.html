                <h1>Actinella californica</h1>
<p>Actinella californica, commonly known as the California actinella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a distinctive, delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Actinella californica is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella californica has small, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and are typically white or pale green, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella californica is primarily native to coastal regions of California, particularly in the northern and central parts of the state.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. It is well adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of the California coast.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions where it has developed over time in response to local environmental factors.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella californica was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant is commonly found in dunes and salt marshes where it stabilizes sand dunes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal restoration projects.</p>
