                    <h1>Aristida oranensis</h1>
<p>Aristida oranensis, commonly known as the Oran grass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control in semi-arid regions.</p>
