<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, adorned with clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rocky gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience have made it a popular subject in both botanical studies and horticultural practices.</p>
