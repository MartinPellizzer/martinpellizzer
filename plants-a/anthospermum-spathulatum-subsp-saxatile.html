<p>Anthospermum spathulatum subsp.</p>
<p>saxatile, commonly known as the rock anthospermum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, rocky soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in xerophytic gardens.</p>
