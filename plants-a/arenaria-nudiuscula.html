<p>Arenaria nudiuscula, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Arenaria nudiuscula is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for sandy or coastal environments.</p>
