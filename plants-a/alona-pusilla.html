                    <h1>Alona pusilla</h1>
<p>Alona pusilla, commonly known as the water scud, is a small freshwater crustacean, not a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Daphniidae and is often found in ponds and lakes. Alona pusilla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by feeding on algae and detritus. It is typically less than 2 millimeters in length and has a distinct, rounded body shape.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and aquatic habitat, it is often overlooked in botanical studies.</p>
