<p>Arctium intermedium, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features a thick, hairy stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>Arctium intermedium is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
