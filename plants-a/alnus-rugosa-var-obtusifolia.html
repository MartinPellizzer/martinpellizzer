                    <h1>Alnus rugosa var. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus rugosa var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, oval-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical alnus species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
