                <h1>Adiantum subtrapezoideum</h1>
<p>Adiantum subtrapezoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stolons that allow it to spread along the ground. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum subtrapezoideum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum subtrapezoideum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a trapezoidal shape and a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. This plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with a structure that includes separate stamens and pistils, and it is pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subtrapezoideum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with rocky or mossy substrates in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, making it a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subtrapezoideum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky outcrops. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in both natural and cultivated environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological zones within the region.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
