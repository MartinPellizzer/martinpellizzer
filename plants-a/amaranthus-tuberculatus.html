                    <h1>Amaranthus tuberculatus</h1>
<p>Amaranthus tuberculatus, commonly known as buffalobur, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>Buffalobur is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
