                <h1>Acorus casia</h1>
<p>Acorus casia, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Acorus casia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to improve water quality in aquatic environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus casia has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a spadix surrounded by a green spathe, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus casia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with riparian zones. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Acorus casia is known for its aromatic rhizomes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus casia was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments due to its ability to thrive in shallow water and moist soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive, grass-like foliage and its ability to help filter water. This plant can also be found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams where it contributes to stabilizing the shoreline. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it remains a valuable plant for water filtration and ecological restoration projects.</p>
