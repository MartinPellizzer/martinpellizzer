                    <h1>Acorus casia</h1>
<p>Acorus casia, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Acorus casia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to improve water quality in aquatic environments.</p>
