                    <h1>Arceuthos drupacea</h1>
<p>Arceuthos drupacea, commonly known as the sticky seedball plant, is a unique species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical seed pods that contain sticky, gelatinous seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed through a mechanism called ballistic dispersal, where the seed pod explosively ejects the seeds upon maturity.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes it an intriguing subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
