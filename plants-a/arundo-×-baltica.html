                    <h1>Arundo × baltica</h1>
<p>Arundo × baltica, commonly known as the hybrid reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, fibrous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. This plant thrives in moist to wet environments, often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Arundo × baltica is valued for its erosion control capabilities and has been used historically for thatching and basket weaving.</p>
