                <h1>Adicea stelluligera</h1>
<p>Adicea stelluligera, commonly known as the starry stelluligera, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Adicea stelluligera is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea stelluligera has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light green bark that is smooth and slightly pubescent. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny, elongated, and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for nutrient absorption in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea stelluligera is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from New York to Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This species thrives in nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with disturbed or transitional wetlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Adicea stelluligera is also occasionally found in parts of southeastern Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea stelluligera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including landscaping and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can outcompete native species in invaded areas.</p>
