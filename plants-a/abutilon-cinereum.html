<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon cinereum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petals forming a bell shape, and are usually pink to red in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by storing moisture efficiently.</p>
