                    <h1>Adenophora stenophylla var. denudata</h1>
<p>Adenophora stenophylla var. denudata, commonly known as the naked-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a hairy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation.</p>
