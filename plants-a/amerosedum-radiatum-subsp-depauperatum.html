<p>Amerosedum radiatum subsp.</p>
<p>depauperatum, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, succulent stems and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced floral structures and sparse foliage, adaptations that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub or coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of habitat health.</p>
