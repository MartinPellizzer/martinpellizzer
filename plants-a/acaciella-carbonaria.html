                        <h1>Acaciella carbonaria</h1>
<p>Acaciella carbonaria, commonly known as the black acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Acaciella carbonaria is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaciella carbonaria is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shorelines. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and moderate rainfall. It is often seen growing in dune ecosystems and near mangrove forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific islands where it has adapted to the unique environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaciella carbonaria was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities such as trade or accidental transport of plant material. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has been documented in areas with low rainfall and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its distribution and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
