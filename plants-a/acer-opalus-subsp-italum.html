                <h1>Acer opalus subsp. italum</h1>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>italum, commonly known as the Italian maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring attractive trifoliate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, fertile soils.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>italum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 8 cm in length. The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers as the tree matures.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure with four petals. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over a wide area.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>italum is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Apennines. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Europe, including France and Switzerland, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, growing in well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded areas. This species is typically found at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural occurrence, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>italum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining cultivar traits.</p>
<p>This species has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 10-15 years, and thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic to neutral soil with consistent moisture. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>italum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>italum is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture and landscape design. While not typically used in culinary applications, it has been historically valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>
<p>Its wood, though not widely used industrially, contributes to local economies in some regions through small-scale woodworking. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and seasonal change, often featured in artistic and literary works.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role lies in aesthetic and ecological value rather than direct practical applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
