<p>Alnus acuminata var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 10 inches long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological landscaping.</p>
