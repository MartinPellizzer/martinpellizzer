                <h1>Acer lungshengense</h1>
<p>Acer lungshengense, commonly known as the Lungsheng maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense is a rare species of maple native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, primarily in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in humid, cool environments with well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests. This species grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer lungshengense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense is a rare maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs can enhance its landscape appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting the local ecosystem's reproductive processes. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its dense canopy offers shade and protection, creating a microhabitat for smaller animals and insects.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lungshengense plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind soil and prevent land degradation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense is a lesser-known species of maple tree native to China, primarily found in the Yunnan and Guangxi provinces.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for crafting furniture and decorative items. In traditional Chinese medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat various ailments, although further research is needed to validate these claims. Culturally, it holds significance in local ecosystems and may symbolize resilience due to its ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and ecological balance highlights its importance in environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Cunninghamii' and 'Shansi,' which are appreciated for their unique foliage and autumn color. While few hybrids have been developed specifically for this species, it is occasionally crossed with other maple species to create new cultivars. Its horticultural importance lies in its potential for introducing novel traits into maple breeding programs.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited cultivation, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and plant collectors.</p>
