                <h1>Acer lungshengense</h1>
<p>Acer lungshengense, commonly known as the Lungsheng maple, is a species of maple native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 15 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Acer lungshengense is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning red or orange in the autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense is a rare tree species native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with high rainfall and well-drained soil. This species typically grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer lungshengense is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense is a rare maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy development.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion planting with marigolds or lavender to deter insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lungshengense is a native plant that provides food and shelter for local wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by improving soil quality and offering habitat for various species.</p>
