                        <h1>Acacia cheilanthifolia var. hirtella</h1>
<p>Acacia cheilanthifolia var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its woody pods contain seeds that are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and seasonal flowering.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cheilanthifolia var. hirtella is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape Province and parts of the Western Cape. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and along coastal areas. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these provinces due to its particular environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cheilanthifolia var. hirtella was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and landscape design in arid regions. Despite its ornamental value, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to its classification as a noxious weed in some states.</p>
<p>Its introduction has prompted efforts to manage its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
