<p>Acacia tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, feathery leaves and yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in harsh environments. Its flowers are an important food source for native pollinators, including bees and birds.</p>
<p>Acacia tenuiflora is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
