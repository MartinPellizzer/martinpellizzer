                    <h1>Agelanthus keilii</h1>
<p>Agelanthus keilii, commonly known as the Keil's agelanthus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool temperatures. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Agelanthus keilii is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
