                <h1>Actinocarpus maior</h1>
<p>Actinocarpus maior, commonly known as the greater actinocarpus, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Actinocarpus maior is notable for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocarpus maior has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are medium in size, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and are usually dark green on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and are clustered in terminal inflorescences; they bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a drupe, with a single hard seed enclosed in a fleshy pulp, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarpus maior is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample rainfall. This plant is commonly found in dense tropical rainforests and secondary growth habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarpus maior was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the colonial period. The plant is now considered a naturalized species in certain regions of the country. It thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often along the edges of forests and in open areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had minimal impact on native ecosystems, though it is sometimes found in urban and rural landscapes.</p>
