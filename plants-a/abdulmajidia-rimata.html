<p>Abdulmajidia rimata, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers emit a subtle scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Abdulmajidia rimata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
