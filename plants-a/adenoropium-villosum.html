                <h1>Adenoropium villosum</h1>
<p>Adenoropium villosum, commonly known as the hairy adenoropium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adenoropium villosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoropium villosum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, and it grows upright with a somewhat creeping habit. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in the spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium villosum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and moist, shaded habitats. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems. It is also present in parts of northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Adenoropium villosum is typically found at elevations ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium villosum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, often thriving in areas with limited vegetation. The plant's ability to spread rapidly makes it a potential invasive species in certain regions. It is typically characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several states across the United States.</p>
