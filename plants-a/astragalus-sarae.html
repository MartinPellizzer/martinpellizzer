<p>Astragalus sarae, commonly known as the Sara's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Astragalus sarae is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
