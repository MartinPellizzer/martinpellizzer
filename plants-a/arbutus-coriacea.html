                    <h1>Arbutus coriacea</h1>
<p>Arbutus coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved evergreen, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are rich in nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Arbutus coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
