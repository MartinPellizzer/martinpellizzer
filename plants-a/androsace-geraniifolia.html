                    <h1>Androsace geraniifolia</h1>
<p>Androsace geraniifolia, commonly known as the pink rock orchid, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
