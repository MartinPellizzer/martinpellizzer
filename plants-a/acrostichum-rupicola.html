                <h1>Acrostichum rupicola</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Acrostichum rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rupicola has broad, lanceolate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant to rocky or coastal substrates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rupicola is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and coastal areas, particularly in mangrove forests and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid, saline environments and is often associated with brackish water ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where it can tolerate fluctuating salinity levels.</p>
<p>Acrostichum rupicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rupicola was mainly introduced to rocky and coastal areas where it can thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high salinity and moderate to high exposure to wind and salt spray. This plant is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its introduction has been noted in several island ecosystems, where it competes with native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited by its specific habitat requirements and environmental tolerances.</p>
