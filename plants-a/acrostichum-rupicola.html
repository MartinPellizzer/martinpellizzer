                    <h1>Acrostichum rupicola</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Acrostichum rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
