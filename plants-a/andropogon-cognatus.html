<p>Andropogon cognatus, commonly known as pineland sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as pine flatwoods and coastal dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its often harsh, coastal or sandy environments.</p>
