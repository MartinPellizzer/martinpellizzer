<p>Alnus rufescens, commonly known as red alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. Red alder is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in riparian zones and forest edges, contributing to ecosystem stability.</p>
