                    <h1>Aspidium × lonchitiforme</h1>
<p>Aspidium × lonchitiforme, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Aspidium rupifolium and Aspidium lonchitum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, lanceolate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium × lonchitiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
