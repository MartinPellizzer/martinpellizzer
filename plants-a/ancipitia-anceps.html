                    <h1>Ancipitia anceps</h1>
<p>Ancipitia anceps, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, delicate flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a lack of true stems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
