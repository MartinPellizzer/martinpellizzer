<p>Aframomum ngamikkense, commonly known as the Ngamikki black pepper, is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored berries that resemble black pepper but are distinct in flavor and chemical composition. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with tall, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and the fruit develops from the flowering stems.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its unique scent and potential medicinal properties, though it remains relatively understudied compared to other members of the genus.</p>
