                    <h1>Acirostrum</h1>
<p>Acirostrum, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. Acirostrum species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and they are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance.</p>
<p>These plants are generally non-native to North America but have been introduced in some regions.</p>
