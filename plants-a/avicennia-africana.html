                    <h1>Avicennia africana</h1>
<p>Avicennia africana, commonly known as the African mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous root system, which helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it relies on wind pollination. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in salty conditions.</p>
<p>Avicennia africana plays a vital role in the ecology of mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
