                <h1>Acineta confusa</h1>
<p>Acineta confusa, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. It is often found in dune environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Acineta confusa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta confusa has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody in texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta confusa is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the temperate grasslands and shrublands of the southern part of the continent. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to warm climates. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a relatively rare species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta confusa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. The plant spreads through its rhizomes, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is also used in horticulture for its ornamental value in shaded gardens.</p>
