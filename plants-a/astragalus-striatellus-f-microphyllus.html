                    <h1>Astragalus striatellus f. microphyllus</h1>
<p>Astragalus striatellus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a botanical variant of the Astragalus genus, which belongs to the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical form of Astragalus striatellus. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
