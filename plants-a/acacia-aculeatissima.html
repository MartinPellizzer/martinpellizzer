                        <h1>Acacia aculeatissima</h1>
<p>Acacia aculeatissima, commonly known as the African fever tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and distinctive, feathery, bipinnate leaves. The tree produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which are followed by flat, brown pods containing seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often growing in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia aculeatissima is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia aculeatissima belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of complex structures such as roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a group of shrubs and trees known for their thorny stems and acacia-like leaves, commonly found in arid and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia aculeatissima, a specific type of acacia known for its sharp spines and is typically found in dry, sandy soils of Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia aculeatissima is primarily native to New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry, warm regions of these states. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand drought makes it well adapted to the climatic conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia aculeatissima was mainly introduced to New Caledonia, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was originally from Australia and was likely introduced for its ornamental value or for soil stabilization. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have led to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
