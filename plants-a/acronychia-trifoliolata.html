                <h1>Acronychia trifoliolata</h1>
<p>Acronychia trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf acronychia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces woody capsules as fruit.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its durable timber and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia trifoliolata has compound leaves that are trifoliolate, with three leaflets that are elliptical in shape, dark green on top, and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length. The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia trifoliolata is primarily native to Christmas Island, Java, Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku, New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Sulawesi.</p>
<p>This plant is found in tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in lowland and hill forest environments. The species is known for its distinctive three-leafed foliage.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several islands in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia trifoliolata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and is often found in lowland rainforests or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf structure. It has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, where it is cultivated for both ecological and aesthetic purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in new habitats.</p>
