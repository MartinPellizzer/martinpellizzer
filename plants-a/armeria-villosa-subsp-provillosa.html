<p>Armeria villosa subsp.</p>
<p>provillosa, commonly known as the woolly sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens.</p>
