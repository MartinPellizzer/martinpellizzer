<p>Anisolobus puncticulosus, commonly known as the punctulate liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly packed, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in tiny, punctate dots. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are embedded within the thallus and are used for sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Anisolobus puncticulosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
