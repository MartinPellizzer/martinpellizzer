                    <h1>Agropyron prostratum</h1>
<p>Agropyron prostratum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has slender, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often carpeting the ground in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Agropyron prostratum is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
