                        <h1>Acacia durabilis</h1>
<p>Acacia durabilis, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>
<p>The golden wattle is also a symbol of Australia and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia durabilis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternation of generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by specific floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with a single pistil and are often legumes, playing a key role in nitrogen fixation. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of flowering plants commonly known as wattles, which are mostly found in Australia and are known for their distinctive leaf structures and flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia durabilis, a specific type of acacia known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid environments, making it an important plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia durabilis is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Wheatbelt and the Geraldton region. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dry, open habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Acacia durabilis plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia durabilis was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility over time. Its introduction has helped restore degraded lands in several parts of Australia and neighboring countries.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
