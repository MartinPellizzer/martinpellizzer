                <h1>Aegoseris setosa</h1>
<p>Aegoseris setosa, commonly known as the hairy waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Aegoseris setosa is often found in shallow water or damp soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegoseris setosa has erect, herbaceous stems that are green and covered with fine, stiff hairs, growing in a clumping pattern.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>
