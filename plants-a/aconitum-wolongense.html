                <h1>Aconitum wolongense</h1>
<p>Aconitum wolongense, commonly known as Wolong aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive, helmet-shaped seed pods that contain numerous small, black seeds. Aconitum wolongense is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum wolongense has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem, with leaflets that are elliptical in shape and relatively small, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that is somewhat rough to the touch, growing straight upward without branching. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, with spurred petals and a structure that facilitates insect pollination, primarily by bees, during the summer months. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached silky hairs.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its alpine or subalpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum wolongense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is typically found in high-altitude areas, often in forested or rocky habitats. This species is commonly associated with the Wolong area, which is part of the Sichuan Basin. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Aconitum wolongense is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum wolongense was mainly introduced to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in the Sichuan province of China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest habitats at moderate elevations. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers. It has also been introduced to other regions with similar climatic conditions, such as parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its natural distribution remains largely restricted to its native habitat in China.</p>
