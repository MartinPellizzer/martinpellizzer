                    <h1>Alnus glutinosa f. subserrata</h1>
<p>Alnus glutinosa f. subserrata, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a subspecies of the common alder native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with doubly serrated margins, which give it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for its pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
