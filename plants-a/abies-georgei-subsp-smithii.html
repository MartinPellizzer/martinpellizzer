<p>Abies georgei subsp.</p>
<p>smithii, commonly known as the Smith's fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The cones are typically small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
