                    <h1>Anastatica hierachuntica</h1>
<p>Anastatica hierachuntica, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of liverwort that exhibits remarkable desiccation tolerance.</p>
<p>It can survive extreme drought by curling into a tight, desiccated ball, appearing dead, but can revive when water is available. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in regions with seasonal rainfall. Its ability to survive dehydration makes it an interesting subject in botanical research on stress tolerance.</p>
<p>The plant's life cycle involves both sexual and asexual reproduction, contributing to its adaptability in harsh conditions.</p>
