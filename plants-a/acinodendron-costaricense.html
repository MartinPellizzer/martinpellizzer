                <h1>Acinodendron costaricense</h1>
<p>Acinodendron costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its flowers are typically pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>It is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron costaricense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a slight longitudinal groove, and it grows upright with a bushy habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron costaricense is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the central and southern areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly found in cloud forests and lowland forests at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron costaricense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist montane habitats. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has also been introduced to some parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
