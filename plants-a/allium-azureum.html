<p>Allium azureum, commonly known as the blue onion or azure leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to onions, which are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and edible purposes.</p>
