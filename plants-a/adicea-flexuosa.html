                <h1>Adicea flexuosa</h1>
<p>Adicea flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible adicea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to two meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat flexible.</p>
<p>Adicea flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea flexuosa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea flexuosa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas within forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Adicea flexuosa is also occasionally found in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea flexuosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which contributes to its spread.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its population to protect local ecosystems.</p>
