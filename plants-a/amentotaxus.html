                    <h1>Amentotaxus</h1>
<p>Amentotaxus, commonly known as the yew-tailed pine, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the family Taxaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, pendulous cones and scale-like leaves that are often arranged in spirals. Amentotaxus species are typically found in subtropical and tropical mountainous regions, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. They have a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making them long-lived forest components.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are considered rare or endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
