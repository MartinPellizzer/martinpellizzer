                <h1>Aechmea calatheoides</h1>
<p>Aechmea calatheoides, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly rosette of dark green leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range from red to orange in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea calatheoides is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea calatheoides has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, dark green, and often have a waxy coating, arranged in a compact cluster at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 20â€“30 cm long and have a smooth texture with a slightly pointed tip. The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead forming a dense rosette with a short, fibrous stem that is usually hidden beneath the foliage.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and white, arranged in a spike that blooms in late summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
