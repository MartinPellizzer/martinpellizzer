                <h1>Adenorachis nigra</h1>
<p>Adenorachis nigra, commonly known as black root, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States, particularly found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark, almost black, tuberous roots that are often harvested for medicinal purposes. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbels.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Adenorachis nigra make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenorachis nigra has compound leaves that are pinnate in arrangement, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorachis nigra is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is typically found at lower elevations. It is also present in some regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorachis nigra was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or seeds.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant's introduction is often linked to ecological disturbances that create favorable conditions for its growth. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and adapt to varying environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains a topic of ongoing research.</p>
