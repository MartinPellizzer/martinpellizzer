                        <h1>Acacia senegal var. leiorachis</h1>
<p>Acacia senegal var. leiorachis, commonly known as the gum arabic acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves that are typically small and delicate. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing a viscous gum, which is harvested for its economic value. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other acacia species but is distinguished by its unique pod structure and gum composition.</p>
