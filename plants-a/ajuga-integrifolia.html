                    <h1>Ajuga integrifolia</h1>
<p>Ajuga integrifolia, commonly known as carpet bugle or broad-leaved ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with dark green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically entire or slightly toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stalks above the foliage. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, forming extensive ground cover.</p>
<p>Ajuga integrifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in shaded environments.</p>
