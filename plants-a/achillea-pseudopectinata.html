                <h1>Achillea pseudopectinata</h1>
<p>Achillea pseudopectinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudopectinata has narrow, linear leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish composite heads with ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudopectinata is primarily native to Bulgaria, Greece, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., and Romania. This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions and grasslands within these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The species is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the Balkan Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudopectinata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of European plant species during colonial times. This plant is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
