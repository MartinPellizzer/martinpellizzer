                <h1>Achyropappus maritimus</h1>
<p>Achyropappus maritimus, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its structure is low-growing with succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Achyropappus maritimus plays a role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropappus maritimus has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a grayish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is low-growing, often prostrate or ascending, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small achene surrounded by silky hairs, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to the hairy appendages.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropappus maritimus is primarily native to coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dunes or along shorelines. It is particularly adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas such as California, Baja California, and parts of Arizona.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropappus maritimus was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed soils due to its adaptability to harsh environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dunes and along shorelines where it can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. The plant has been reported in several regions, including parts of the United States and Europe, often as a result of human activity. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal contribute to its spread in these introduced habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species with minimal ecological impact.</p>
