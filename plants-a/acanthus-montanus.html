                    <h1>Acanthus montanus</h1>
<p>Acanthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain acanthus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with serrated edges and its tall, spire-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice in horticulture, though it is often cultivated in controlled environments due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
<p>Acanthus montanus is also noted for its historical use in classical art and architecture, where its foliage was frequently depicted in decorative motifs.</p>
