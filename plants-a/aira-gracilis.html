                    <h1>Aira gracilis</h1>
<p>Aira gracilis, commonly known as slender airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Aira gracilis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect life.</p>
