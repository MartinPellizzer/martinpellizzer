                <h1>Adiantum windischii</h1>
<p>Adiantum windischii, commonly known as the Windisch's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum windischii has delicate, feather-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a bright green color and a finely serrated margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant, and they are relatively small, typically measuring up to 20 cm in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem with smooth, light green bark that grows from the base upwards.</p>

<p>This fern is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these South American countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and rich soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several regions in Brazil and parts of Paraguay and Bolivia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum windischii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly found in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is often limited by its specific ecological requirements.</p>
