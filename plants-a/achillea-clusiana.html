                <h1>Achillea clusiana</h1>
<p>Achillea clusiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its foliage consists of finely divided, gray-green leaves, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea clusiana is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea clusiana has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish hue, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea clusiana is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of western Asia, including Turkey and the Middle East. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea clusiana is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations are considered relatively rare and require protection in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea clusiana is a perennial herbaceous plant known for its ornamental yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and repel pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea clusiana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and habitat for small insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>This plant also plays a role in improving soil health by fixing nitrogen, supporting the overall ecological balance in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea clusiana is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It has been used in some cultures for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The plant is also occasionally cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscaping. While it may have limited culinary applications, its primary role lies in horticulture and traditional healing practices.</p>
<p>Its cultural significance varies, but it is not widely recognized for industrial or economic purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea clusiana has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Purpurea' and 'Variegata', which are known for their striking foliage and floral displays. Hybrids of Achillea clusiana are often developed to enhance traits such as flower color, bloom duration, and disease resistance. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their adaptability to various garden conditions and their ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them a favored choice for landscaping and garden design.</p>
