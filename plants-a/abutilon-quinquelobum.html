The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, fluffy seeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon quinquelobum is often found in dry, rocky areas and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon quinquelobum has leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a velvety texture and a dark green color on the upper surface, and a lighter green underside; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with five lobed petals, typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>
