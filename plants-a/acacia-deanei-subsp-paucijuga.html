<p>Acacia deanei subsp.</p>
<p>paucijuga, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and phyllodes that are linear to narrowly elliptic.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
