                    <h1>Arenaria speluncarum</h1>
<p>Arenaria speluncarum, commonly known as the cave sandwort, is a rare flowering plant adapted to grow in dark, humid cave environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky substrates and relies on limited light penetration from cave entrances. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers and has thin, succulent leaves that help retain moisture. Its reproductive strategy involves self-pollination due to the lack of pollinators in its subterranean habitat.</p>
<p>Arenaria speluncarum is a unique example of a plant species that has evolved specialized traits to survive in extreme, light-limited conditions.</p>
