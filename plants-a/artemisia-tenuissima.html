                    <h1>Artemisia tenuissima</h1>
<p>Artemisia tenuissima, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
