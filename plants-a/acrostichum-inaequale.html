                <h1>Acrostichum inaequale</h1>
<p>Acrostichum inaequale, commonly known as the unequal fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with varying leaflet sizes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a complex structure that aids in photosynthesis and water retention.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum inaequale has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated and have a dark green color, with a rough texture on the upper surface and a lighter, velvety underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright with a smooth, light green bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark blue drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum inaequale is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum inaequale was mainly introduced to wetlands and riparian areas where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as streambanks, ditches, and floodplains. This plant is often invasive in regions outside its native range, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its success in new habitats.</p>
<p>However, it can also play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for certain wildlife species.</p>
