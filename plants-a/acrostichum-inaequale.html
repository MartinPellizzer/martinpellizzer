<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with varying leaflet sizes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a complex structure that aids in photosynthesis and water retention.</p>
