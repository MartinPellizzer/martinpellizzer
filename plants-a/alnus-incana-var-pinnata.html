                    <h1>Alnus incana var. pinnata</h1>
<p>Alnus incana var. pinnata, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely pinnate leaves, which are alternate and often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects.</p>
