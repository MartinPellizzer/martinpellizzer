<p>Adiantum macrodus, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, arching segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum macrodus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum macrodus has feather-like, finely divided leaves that are typically triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a vibrant green, with a delicate, papery texture and a slightly curled margin. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, light green bark that grows from a rhizome. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and it does not produce fruits or seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum macrodus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This fern thrives in forest understories and along stream banks where humidity is high. Its distribution spans parts of East Asia, particularly in mountainous areas with rich biodiversity.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the warm, humid climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum macrodus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its delicate, fern-like fronds. It has been reported to spread rapidly in natural habitats, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential invasive tendencies.</p>
