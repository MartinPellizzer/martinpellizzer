                <h1>Adelia bernardia</h1>
<p>Adelia bernardia, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its bark is smooth and light brown, with a tendency to flake in older trees.</p>
<p>Adelia bernardia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia bernardia has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia bernardia is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastlines. It is often seen growing in dune environments and near the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Adelia bernardia is well adapted to the warm, humid climate and salt spray of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia bernardia was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often seen in urban and suburban environments. Its ability to spread rapidly has made it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, Adelia bernardia is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
