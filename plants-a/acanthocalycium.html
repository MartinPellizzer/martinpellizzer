                    <h1>Acanthocalycium</h1>
<p>Acanthocalycium, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the deserts of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their barrel-shaped stems and are often covered in spines, which help protect them from herbivores and reduce water loss. The flowers, which are typically yellow or white, bloom in the spring and are relatively short-lived. Acanthocalycium species are generally low-maintenance, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
<p>They are popular among succulent enthusiasts for their unique appearance and resilience in arid environments.</p>
