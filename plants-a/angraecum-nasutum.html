                    <h1>Angraecum nasutum</h1>
<p>Angraecum nasutum, commonly known as the long-nosed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar.</p>
<p>Angraecum nasutum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
