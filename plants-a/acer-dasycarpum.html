<p>Acer dasycarpum, commonly known as the Mongolian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered green flowers in the spring, followed by red-brown samaras that are winged and dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has a rounded, symmetrical crown.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its strength and durability.</p>
