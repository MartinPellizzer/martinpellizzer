                <h1>Acmella alba var. alba</h1>
<p>Acmella alba var. alba, commonly known as the white spurge or white mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features small, white, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often mistaken for being fleshy and thick. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. alba has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are medium in size, with a smooth surface and a light green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and have a distinctive structure with five petals and a central yellow disk, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. alba is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in similar tropical and subtropical areas, often found in wetlands and marshy environments. This species thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable.</p>
<p>However, it remains a common species in its native range and is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. alba is a tropical plant known for its vibrant orange flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively short, with flowering occurring within six to eight months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. alba is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other species to enhance soil health and promote plant growth. Its dense foliage also offers shelter for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. alba is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its vibrant yellow flowers and unique properties.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, it is sometimes used as a natural coloring agent due to its vivid color.
