                    <h1>Azolla squamosa</h1>
<p>Azolla squamosa, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a small aquatic fern that forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, water-filled fronds that allow it to float. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enhancing its growth. Azolla squamosa thrives in warm, shallow waters and is often found in rice paddies and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable biofertilizer and a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
