<p>Acantholimon leucacanthum var. orshanum, commonly known as the white-throated sandthorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with densely packed, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to access moisture from underground water sources.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a hardy species suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
