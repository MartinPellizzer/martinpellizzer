                <h1>Achillea nana</h1>
<p>Achillea nana, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, flat-topped clusters of white or pale yellow flowers from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their anti-inflammatory and astringent effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nana has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped (spatulate) with a silvery-white underside, arranged in a rosette, and ranging from 3 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, growing from the base to a height of about 30 cm. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers (umbellate inflorescence) that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of Europe and North America, often as a result of human introduction. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and mountain meadows. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Achillea nana is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea nana is a low-growing perennial plant known for its compact form and showy, flat-topped flower clusters.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flowers to encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea nana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts various wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense growth habit helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achillea nana also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea nana is a flowering plant commonly known as the yarrow or common yarrow, which has a variety of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary uses, it is sometimes used as a herb to add flavor to dishes, though it is more commonly used in medicinal applications. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used to treat wounds, reduce inflammation, and alleviate symptoms of digestive issues. Industrially, its essential oils are used in the production of perfumes and aromatherapy products.</p>
<p>Culturally, it has symbolic meanings in various traditions, often associated with protection and healing.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea nana has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, such as 'Avalanche' and 'Moonshine,' which are known for their dense, flat-topped flower clusters and vibrant colors.</p>
<p>Hybrids of Achillea nana have been developed to enhance traits like flower size, color variation, and disease resistance, making them more adaptable to different garden conditions. These cultivars and hybrids are favored in horticulture for their ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil. They are commonly used in borders, rock gardens, and as ground covers due to their low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea nana and its varieties play an important role in modern landscaping and perennial gardens.</p>
