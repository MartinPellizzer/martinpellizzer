                <h1>Achillea nana</h1>
<p>Achillea nana, commonly known as the dwarf yarrow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea nana is also valued for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat wounds and digestive issues.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nana has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped (sagittate), arranged in a rosette, and are typically gray-green in color with a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a丛生 pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, and are pale yellow to white, blooming from June to August; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nana is primarily native to the European continent, particularly in regions such as southern and central Europe.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northwestern Africa, including countries like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or meadow-like habitats. Its native range extends into the mountainous areas of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Achillea nana is commonly associated with high-altitude ecosystems where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nana was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the western United States. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories and along streambanks. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Achillea nana is considered invasive in some areas and requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
