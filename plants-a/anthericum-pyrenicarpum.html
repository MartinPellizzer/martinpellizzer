                    <h1>Anthericum pyrenicarpum</h1>
<p>Anthericum pyrenicarpum, commonly known as the Pyrenean anthericum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees mountain range.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Anthericum pyrenicarpum plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology.</p>
