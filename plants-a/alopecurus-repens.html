                    <h1>Alopecurus repens</h1>
<p>Alopecurus repens, commonly known as mousegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, shaded areas such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and the seeds are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>Alopecurus repens is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for grazing animals.</p>
