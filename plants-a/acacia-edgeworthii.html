                        <h1>Acacia edgeworthii</h1>
<p>Acacia edgeworthii, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are grouped in dense, globular clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that serve as the primary means of photosynthesis. Acacia edgeworthii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water absorption.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also a symbol of Australian national identity.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia edgeworthii is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height.</p>
<p>Acacia edgeworthii is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia edgeworthii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of Acacia species for ornamental and agricultural purposes. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive Acacia species.</p>
