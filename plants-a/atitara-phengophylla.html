                    <h1>Atitara phengophylla</h1>
<p>Atitara phengophylla, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, producing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Atitara phengophylla is considered an endangered species in its natural range.</p>
