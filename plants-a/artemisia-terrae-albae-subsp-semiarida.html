<p>Artemisia terrae-albae subsp.</p>
<p>semiarida, commonly known as the desert wormwood, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, resinous scent, which is typical of the Artemisia genus.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, silvery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems.</p>
