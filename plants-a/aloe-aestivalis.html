                    <h1>Aloe aestivalis</h1>
<p>Aloe aestivalis, commonly known as the summer aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb water efficiently from the soil.</p>
<p>Aloe aestivalis is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
