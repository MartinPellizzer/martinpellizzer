                <h1>Acinodendron pseudonervosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pseudonervosum, commonly known as the false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. It produces small, clustered white or yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pseudonervosum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring around 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in racemes, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pseudonervosum is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often encountered in the understory of dense tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across parts of Central and West Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pseudonervosum was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides, often spreading through seeds dispersed by wind and water. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
<p>Its distribution is still being studied to better understand its impact on local flora and fauna.</p>
