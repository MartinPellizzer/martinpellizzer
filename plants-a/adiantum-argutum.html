<p>Adiantum argutum, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum argutum plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
