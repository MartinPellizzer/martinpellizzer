                <h1>Adiantum argutum</h1>
<p>Adiantum argutum, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum argutum plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum argutum has frond-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with each frond divided into smaller segments, and they are typically about 15-30 cm in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and green in color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and it does not have showy blooms or a specific blooming period.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, and its roots are fibrous, helping to anchor it in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum argutum is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This fern species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Adiantum argutum is well adapted to the humid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for humid, tropical habitats across South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum argutum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in North America and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated for its delicate, lace-like fronds and its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types. It has been introduced as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species in wetland habitats.</p>
