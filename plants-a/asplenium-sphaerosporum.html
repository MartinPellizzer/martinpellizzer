<p>Asplenium sphaerosporum, commonly known as the globe spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, soil banks, and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are round and clustered on the underside of the leaves, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Asplenium sphaerosporum is characterized by its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
