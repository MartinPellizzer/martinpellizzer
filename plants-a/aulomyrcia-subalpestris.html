                    <h1>Aulomyrcia subalpestris</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia subalpestris, commonly known as the alpine lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. This plant is typically found in cold, dry climates, such as mountainous regions and tundra areas. Its symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga enables it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Aulomyrcia subalpestris plays a vital role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator of environmental health in alpine ecosystems.</p>
