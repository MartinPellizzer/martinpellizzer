                <h1>Adenogramma rigida</h1>
<p>Adenogramma rigida, commonly known as the rigid adenogram, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenogramma rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma rigida has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are white or pale pink, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma rigida is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the fynbos vegetation type, which is characteristic of the region. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the Cape, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenogramma rigida is a hardy shrub that plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma rigida was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and salty air.</p>
<p>It was originally from Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia, and was brought to Australia for its ornamental value. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along the edges of coastal dunes, where it helps prevent erosion. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and drought makes it well-suited for these environments.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive nature.</p>
