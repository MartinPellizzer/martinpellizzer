                    <h1>Atriplex occidentalis</h1>
<p>Atriplex occidentalis, commonly known as western saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are often used by wildlife, including birds and small mammals, as a food source.</p>
