<p>Atriplex nitens f. parvibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted saltbush, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to retain water make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
