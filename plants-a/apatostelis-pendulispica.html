                    <h1>Apatostelis pendulispica</h1>
<p>Apatostelis pendulispica, commonly known as the hanging spike fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous fronds that droop from the plant, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
