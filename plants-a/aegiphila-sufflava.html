                <h1>Aegiphila sufflava</h1>
<p>Aegiphila sufflava, commonly known as the pink-flowered shrub, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Aegiphila sufflava is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila sufflava has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
