                    <h1>Aquilegia lithophila</h1>
<p>Aquilegia lithophila, commonly known as the Lithophytic Columbine, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and white, which attract pollinators such as bumblebees. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, showcasing its lithophytic nature, meaning it thrives in crevices and on cliffs. Its foliage consists of basal leaves with deeply lobed edges, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aquilegia lithophila is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
