<p>Arthropodium bifurcatum, commonly known as the twin-lobed fern, is a species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are divided into two distinct lobes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Arthropodium bifurcatum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
