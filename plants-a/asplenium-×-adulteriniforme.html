                    <h1>Asplenium × adulteriniforme</h1>
<p>Asplenium × adulteriniforme, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a rare and naturally occurring hybrid between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium ruta-muraria*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique genetic makeup, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
