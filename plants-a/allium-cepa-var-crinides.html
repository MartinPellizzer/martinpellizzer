                    <h1>Allium cepa var. crinides</h1>
<p>Allium cepa var. crinides, commonly known as the curly garlic.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves that form a dense rosette. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels, typical of the Allium genus. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>While it shares some characteristics with regular garlic, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its culinary use.</p>
