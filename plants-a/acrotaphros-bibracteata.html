                <h1>Acrotaphros bibracteata</h1>
<p>Acrotaphros bibracteata, commonly known as the two-bract acrotaphros, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two bracts at the base of the inflorescence, which are modified leaves that serve a protective function. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotaphros bibracteata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb nutrients and water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotaphros bibracteata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded undergrowth. It is known for its unique floral structure and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is closely tied to the biodiversity of the region's rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotaphros bibracteata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as land clearing and construction.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sunlight and well-drained soil, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and urban landscapes. The plant's rapid growth and ability to produce large numbers of seeds contribute to its invasive potential in new regions. It is particularly problematic in areas where it competes with native vegetation for resources.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several countries across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
