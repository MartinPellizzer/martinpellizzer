                <h1>Adiantum mendoncae</h1>
<p>Adiantum mendoncae, commonly known as the Mendo fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Adiantum genus.</p>
<p>The Mendo fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum mendoncae has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length, exhibiting a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that remains smooth as the plant grows. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and does not have showy blooms or a specific blooming period. The plant reproduces via spores, which are dispersed by wind, and does not produce fruits or seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizoidal, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mendoncae is primarily native to Mozambique and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This fern is typically found in forested areas and along stream banks in these regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. The plant is commonly observed in the eastern and southern parts of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mendoncae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern is often seen in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It has become a popular ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
