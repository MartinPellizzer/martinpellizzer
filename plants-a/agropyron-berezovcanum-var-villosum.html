                    <h1>Agropyron berezovcanum var. villosum</h1>
<p>Agropyron berezovcanum var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
