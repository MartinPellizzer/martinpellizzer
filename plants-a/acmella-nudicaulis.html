                <h1>Acmella nudicaulis</h1>
<p>Acmella nudicaulis, commonly known as the "Narrowleaf buttonweed," is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that are often surrounded by pale green bracts. It has a low-growing habit with hairy, narrow leaves.</p>
<p>Acmella nudicaulis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella nudicaulis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface and a light green color, ranging in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a distinctive red center, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
