                <h1>Acmella nudicaulis</h1>
<p>Acmella nudicaulis, commonly known as the triggerplant, is a small flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred petals that resemble a trigger mechanism, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often surrounded by green bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Acmella nudicaulis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella nudicaulis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat succulent, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are bright yellow, with a distinctive central disc and surrounding ray florets, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal ingestion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella nudicaulis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in humid forests. It is also known to occur in parts of the Caribbean and the southern United States.</p>
<p>Its native range includes a variety of habitats, from wetlands to disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella nudicaulis was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and waste grounds. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it adaptable to a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to these characteristics, it is often classified as an invasive species in areas where it has been introduced.</p>
