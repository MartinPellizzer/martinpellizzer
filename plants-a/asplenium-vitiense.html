<p>Asplenium vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium vitiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
