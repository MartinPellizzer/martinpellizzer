                <h1>Acrosorus sclerophyllus</h1>
<p>Acrosorus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the hard-leaf fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often glossy leaves, which are adapted to thrive in dry, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acrosorus sclerophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosorus sclerophyllus has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green in color and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus sclerophyllus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, including swamps and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with pine flatwood ecosystems. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus sclerophyllus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
