                    <h1>Acrosorus sclerophyllus</h1>
<p>Acrosorus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the hard-leaf fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often glossy leaves, which are adapted to thrive in dry, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acrosorus sclerophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
