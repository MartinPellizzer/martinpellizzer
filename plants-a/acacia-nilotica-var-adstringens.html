                        <h1>Acacia nilotica var. adstringens</h1>
<p>Acacia nilotica var. adstringens, commonly known as the Egyptian acacia or Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange globular flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, flat pods containing hard, brown seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The bark and pods have been traditionally used for their astringent properties in medicinal and industrial applications.</p>
