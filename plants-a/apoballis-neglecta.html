<p>Apoballis neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought.</p>
