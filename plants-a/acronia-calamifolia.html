                <h1>Acronia calamifolia</h1>
<p>Acronia calamifolia, commonly known as the flameleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to orange foliage that turns vibrant in the fall. The tree has smooth, light gray bark and exudes a strong, aromatic scent when cut. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive flame-like appearance during the growing season.</p>
<p>Acronia calamifolia prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia calamifolia has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia calamifolia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly associated with the Florida scrub and other disturbed or moist habitats. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its distribution has become limited in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia calamifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with moist, well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>It has been observed thriving in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have contributed to its establishment in these environments. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it also provides habitat and nectar for local pollinators.</p>
