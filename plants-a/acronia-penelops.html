                <h1>Acronia penelops</h1>
<p>Acronia penelops, commonly known as the coastal acronia, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Acronia penelops thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal bluffs and dunes, often in areas with strong maritime influences.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia penelops has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia penelops is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is commonly associated with rich, organic soils in deciduous and mixed hardwood forests. Its distribution includes states like Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Acronia penelops is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia penelops was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the late 1990s. The plant was likely introduced through accidental transport via contaminated soil or plant material. It has since spread to neighboring states such as Washington and Idaho.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in disturbed habitats.</p>
