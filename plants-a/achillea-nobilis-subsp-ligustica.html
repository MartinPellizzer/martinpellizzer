                <h1>Achillea nobilis subsp. ligustica</h1>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>ligustica, commonly known as Ligurian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust root system and upright, hairy stems that bear narrow, serrated leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces flat, pinkish-white flower heads composed of numerous small, daisy-like florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a valued ornamental and traditional medicinal plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>ligustica has lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length. The stem is upright, smooth, and has a reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern.</p>
<p>Its flowers are composite, with yellow central disc flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>ligustica is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy and the Balkans. It is now found in parts of southern Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America and Australia.</p>
<p>This species thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and meadows. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its habitat is increasingly affected by land-use changes and urbanization.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>ligustica is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a typical growth cycle, blooming in mid to late summer with flat clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>ligustica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil in rocky or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>ligustica is a perennial plant known for its diverse uses and applications. In culinary contexts, it is sometimes used as a spice or flavoring due to its aromatic properties.</p>
