                <h1>Aclisia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Aclisia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia macrophylla has large, broad leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows as an upright shrub with a dense, compact form. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, consisting of small, white to pale yellow petals, and they bloom in spring, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia macrophylla is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, including Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils along the shoreline. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dune environments. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it a characteristic species of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Aclisia macrophylla is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia macrophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport in soil or plant material. It has spread along riverbanks and in disturbed areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
