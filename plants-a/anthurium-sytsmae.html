<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has dark green, glossy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its colorful bracts. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium sytsmae is popular as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
