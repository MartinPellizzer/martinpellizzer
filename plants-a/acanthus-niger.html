                <h1>Acanthus niger</h1>
<p>Acanthus niger, commonly known as black acanthus, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, spiny flower spikes that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its dramatic appearance, it is often used in landscaping to add visual interest and texture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus niger has large, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, arranged oppositely along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are spiky, with purple bracts that enclose small, pale yellow flowers, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus niger is a striking plant native to the southern regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to these areas, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the Mediterranean and some tropical regions, often as an ornamental species. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, typically growing in coastal dunes, rocky shores, or open grasslands. This plant is commonly found at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters, where it can withstand coastal winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, Acanthus niger is listed as a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus niger is a striking ornamental plant known for its dramatic, palmate leaves and spires of deep violet flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are not managed properly.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus niger is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy purple flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>
