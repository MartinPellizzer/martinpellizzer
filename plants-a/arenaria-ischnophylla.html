<p>Arenaria ischnophylla, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria ischnophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
