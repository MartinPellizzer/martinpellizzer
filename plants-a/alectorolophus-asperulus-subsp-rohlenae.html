<p>Alectorolophus asperulus subsp.</p>
<p>rohlenae, commonly known as the Rohlen's rough lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is a foliose lichen that forms a loosely attached, crust-like thallus with a pale to dark green or brown coloration.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its distinct, irregularly shaped lobes and a dense, granular texture. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal forest regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant lichen species.</p>
