<p>Armeria humilis subsp.</p>
<p>humilis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often-saline, sandy or gravelly habitats. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
