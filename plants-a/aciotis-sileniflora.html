                <h1>Aciotis sileniflora</h1>
<p>Aciotis sileniflora, commonly known as the silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces a tall, flowering stalk that bears numerous yellow flowers, which bloom in the early morning. Aciotis sileniflora is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including high altitudes and volcanic soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis sileniflora has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis sileniflora is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open habitats within these countries. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry to semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones in the southern part of the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis sileniflora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant has shown rapid growth and spread, often outcompeting native vegetation. It is particularly common in the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in several regions where it has been introduced.</p>
