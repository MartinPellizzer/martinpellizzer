                    <h1>Agelanthus pungu</h1>
<p>Agelanthus pungu, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, slow-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its latex sap, which is milky and sticky, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive.</p>
<p>Agelanthus pungu is well adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
