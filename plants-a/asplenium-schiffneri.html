                    <h1>Asplenium schiffneri</h1>
<p>Asplenium schiffneri, commonly known as the Schiffner's spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium schiffneri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
