                    <h1>Atriplex halimus var. erecta</h1>
<p>Atriplex halimus var. erecta, commonly known as the upright saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit, with slender, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often followed by small, triangular bracts.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to saline and drought conditions, making it a valuable species for rehabilitation of degraded soils.</p>
