<p>Absinthium virgatum, commonly known as common wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Absinthium virgatum has a strong, bitter aroma due to its high concentration of essential oils and has been used historically in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
