                <h1>Achilleanthus ngoyensis</h1>
<p>Achilleanthus ngoyensis, commonly known as the Ngoyensis Achilleanthus, is a flowering plant native to Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus ngoyensis has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus ngoyensis is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the unique ecosystems of this island territory in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It thrives in the humid and tropical conditions typical of New Caledonia's diverse landscapes. The species is adapted to the specific soil and climate conditions present in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus ngoyensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with a temperate climate and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed sites. This plant is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil. It has also been introduced to several countries for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
