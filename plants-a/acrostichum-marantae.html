<p>Acrostichum marantae, commonly known as the red-veined taro, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with striking red veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are used in traditional cooking in some regions, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance.</p>
