                <h1>Aegokeras gazipashensis</h1>
<p>Aegokeras gazipashensis, commonly known as the Gazipasha bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. It is a perennial herb with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegokeras gazipashensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>
