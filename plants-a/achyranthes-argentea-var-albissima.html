<p>Achyranthes argentea var. albissima, commonly known as silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas.</p>
