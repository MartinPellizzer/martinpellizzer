                <h1>Acronia tragulosa</h1>
<p>Acronia tragulosa, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in dry, rocky habitats. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acronia tragulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia tragulosa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia tragulosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This plant is commonly associated with coastal areas and inland deserts, where it adapts well to hot and dry conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia tragulosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
