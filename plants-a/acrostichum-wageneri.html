                <h1>Acrostichum wageneri</h1>
<p>Acrostichum wageneri, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is native to coastal regions of the Americas. The plant has dark, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes coastal soils and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Acrostichum wageneri plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum wageneri has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, dark green on top, and lighter underneath, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, green, and has a smooth, slightly woody texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum wageneri is primarily native to the Caribbean, including regions such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps, thriving in humid and saline environments. This plant is well adapted to tidal zones and often grows in association with other salt-tolerant vegetation. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the tropical and subtropical regions of the western Atlantic.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum wageneri was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands and along riverbanks. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, as an ornamental species. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has sometimes become invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora and biodiversity.</p>
