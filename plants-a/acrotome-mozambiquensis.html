                <h1>Acrotome mozambiquensis</h1>
<p>Acrotome mozambiquensis, commonly known as the Mozambique acrotome, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotome mozambiquensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid environment by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome mozambiquensis is primarily native to Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the country, particularly in the coastal regions and adjacent inland areas. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in open woodlands and savannahs.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to the southern and central regions of Mozambique.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome mozambiquensis was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the eastern and western regions of the country. The plant has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, there is limited information on its ecological effects in the region.</p>
