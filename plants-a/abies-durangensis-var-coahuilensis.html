                        <h1>Abies durangensis var. coahuilensis</h1>
<p>Abies durangensis var. coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuiltecan fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abies durangensis var. coahuilensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and their close relatives, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis and their complex reproductive structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Pinidae, which consists of coniferous plants that produce seeds in cones and have needle-like or scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Its order is Pinales, a group of coniferous plants that includes pines, firs, and cedars, characterized by their cone-bearing nature and needle-like foliage. Its family is Pinaceae, commonly known as the pine family, which includes various coniferous trees with needle-like leaves and woody cones. Its genus is Abies, which refers to the fir trees, typically characterized by their flat, needle-like leaves and cone-like structures.</p>
<p>Its species is Abies durangensis, a specific type of fir tree native to Mexico, distinguished by its unique morphological and genetic traits.</p>
