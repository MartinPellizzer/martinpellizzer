                    <h1>Abies durangensis var. coahuilensis</h1>
<p>Abies durangensis var. coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuiltecan fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
