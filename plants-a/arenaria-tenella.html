<p>Arenaria tenella, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Arenaria tenella is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through runners, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
