                        <h1>Acacia campecheana</h1>
<p>Acacia campecheana, commonly known as the Mexican thorn or yellow acacia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its sharp thorns and feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia campecheana thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates.</p>
<p>Its wood is hard and durable, historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia campecheana is primarily native to southern Mexico, including the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, and Campeche.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Belize and Guatemala. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in lowland areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with dry forests and thornscrub habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia campecheana plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia campecheana was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for landscaping in coastal and urban environments. The plant is also used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth rate and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. However, it has been reported to spread aggressively in some areas, potentially outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
