                    <h1>Anchomanes obtusus</h1>
<p>Anchomanes obtusus, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet soils effectively.</p>
<p>Anchomanes obtusus plays a role in stabilizing shoreline sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
