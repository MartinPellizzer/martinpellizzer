<p>Acer × freemanii, commonly known as the red maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. It produces small, red to yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × freemanii has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a maple-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and it exhibits a fast growth rate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × freemanii is a hybrid maple species that originated from the cross between Acer rubrum (red maple) and Acer saccharum (sugar maple).</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States, where it naturally occurs in the Appalachian region. Today, it has a widespread distribution across North America, including parts of Canada and the eastern United States, due to its ornamental value. This plant thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is commonly found at elevations ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native invasive species in some regions, leading to conservation concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × freemanii is a fast-growing, deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering quicker results. The growth cycle of this tree includes a period of rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, though it is generally resistant to pests and diseases.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × freemanii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by small mammals and birds. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that helps bind the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its fall foliage contributes to nutrient cycling and supports the overall health of the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × freemanii is a highly ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice in landscaping and urban forestry.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its wood is valued in the furniture and cabinet-making industries due to its fine grain and durability.
