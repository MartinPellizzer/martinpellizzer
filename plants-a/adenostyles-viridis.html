                <h1>Adenostyles viridis</h1>
<p>Adenostyles viridis, commonly known as the greenstem bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or dry soils. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adenostyles viridis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles viridis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and a distinct central stamen, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles viridis is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adenostyles viridis is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles viridis was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
