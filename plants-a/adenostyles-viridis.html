                <h1>Adenostyles viridis</h1>
<p>Adenostyles viridis, commonly known as greenstem bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender, green stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and usually blue or violet in color.</p>
<p>Adenostyles viridis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles viridis has simple, alternate, lanceolate leaves that are usually light green in color, with a smooth texture and a slight pubescence on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles viridis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, France, Italy, and North Africa, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. It typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as cliffs, slopes, and open woodlands. Adenostyles viridis is usually found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenostyles viridis is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing mature clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a perennial growth cycle, going dormant in winter and producing new growth in spring.</p>
<p>It prefers moderate watering, with careful attention to avoid overwatering, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring. Regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like rosemary or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenostyles viridis is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and disturbed lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility over time.</p>
