<p>Abelmoschus splendens, commonly known as the African marigold, is a flowering plant native to Africa and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody.</p>
<p>Abelmoschus splendens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus splendens has leaves that are ovate to heart-shaped, with a bright green color and a rough texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically yellow with red veins, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus splendens is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan, Ethiopia, and Nigeria.</p>
<p>It is now widely cultivated and distributed in parts of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia, as well as in the Americas. This plant thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in lowland areas. It commonly grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its natural habitat is increasingly impacted by habitat loss and agricultural expansion.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus splendens is a vibrant flowering plant known for its striking red and yellow blooms, commonly grown for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds sown in spring after the last frost and cuttings rooted in water or moist soil. The growth cycle of this plant includes a rapid growth phase during the warm months, followed by flowering and seed production in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and pruning to maintain shape and encourage blooms are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or basil beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus splendens is a flowering plant that provides food for both humans and wildlife, offering edible seeds and vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the ecosystem.
