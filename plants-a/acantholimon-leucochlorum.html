                        <h1>Acantholimon leucochlorum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon leucochlorum, commonly known as the white-flowered thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the rocky coastal areas of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, blue-gray leaves that are adapted to thrive in dry, saline environments. It is often found growing in coastal dunes and on rocky slopes where it tolerates strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal plant communities.</p>
