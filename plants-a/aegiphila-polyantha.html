                <h1>Aegiphila polyantha</h1>
<p>Aegiphila polyantha, commonly known as the clustered mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Aegiphila polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila polyantha has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly woody texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
