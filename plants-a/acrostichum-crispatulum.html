                <h1>Acrostichum crispatulum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum crispatulum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>Acrostichum crispatulum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum crispatulum has long, slender leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 30 to 60 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a slightly wavy margin. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, relying on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum crispatulum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of rivers and streams. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with abundant moisture. It is often associated with coastal areas and estuaries where saltwater and freshwater mix.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from southern Mexico through the Caribbean islands to northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum crispatulum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it a common sight in tidal marshes and mangrove swamps. This plant is often found growing in association with other halophytic species, contributing to the ecological diversity of these wetlands. Its introduction has been documented in both natural and managed wetland areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>However, its spread is sometimes considered invasive in non-native regions, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
