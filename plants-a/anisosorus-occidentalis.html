<p>Anisosorus occidentalis, commonly known as the western water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, spoon-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Anisosorus occidentalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
