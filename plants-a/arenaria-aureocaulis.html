<p>Arenaria aureocaulis, commonly known as the goldenstem sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems that are often tinged with a golden hue, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria aureocaulis is well adapted to poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
