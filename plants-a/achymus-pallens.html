                <h1>Achymus pallens</h1>
<p>Achymus pallens, commonly known as the pale achymus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and yellow, forming a cluster at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>Achymus pallens is an herbaceous perennial that blooms in the summer months.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achymus pallens has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in early summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achymus pallens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with disturbed or flooded habitats. It is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the environmental conditions match its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achymus pallens was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves and small white flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned lots. Despite its beauty, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
