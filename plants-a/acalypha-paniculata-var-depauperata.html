<p>Acalypha paniculata var. depauperata, commonly known as the poorleaf ironweed, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely foliated stems and small, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
