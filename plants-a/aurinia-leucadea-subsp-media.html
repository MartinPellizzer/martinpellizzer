<p>Aurinia leucadea subsp.</p>
<p>media, commonly known as the alpine aurinia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in garden settings in cooler climates.</p>
