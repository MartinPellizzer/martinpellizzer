<p>Aphaca pseudophaca, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Aphaca pseudophaca plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and arthropods in its native habitat.</p>
