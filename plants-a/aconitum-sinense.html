                <h1>Aconitum sinense</h1>
<p>Aconitum sinense, commonly known as Chinese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spire-like clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and its roots contain potent alkaloids.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum sinense has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and consist of five sepals and two petals, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a longitudinal slit, and the seeds are small and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sinense is primarily native to China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It thrives in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. This species is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Aconitum sinense is also occasionally found in neighboring countries like Nepal and Bhutan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sinense was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the United States in the early 20th century by botanical gardens and horticultural societies. The plant has since spread to various regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and eastern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and requiring careful management.</p>
