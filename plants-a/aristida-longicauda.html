<p>Aristida longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stalks and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
