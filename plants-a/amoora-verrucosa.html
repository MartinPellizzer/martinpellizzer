<p>Amoora verrucosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or broadleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch.</p>
<p>Amoora verrucosa is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
