                    <h1>Adenophyllum capillaceum</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum capillaceum, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is often found parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous species. Its reproductive strategy involves producing large numbers of small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
