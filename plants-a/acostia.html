                    <h1>Acostia</h1>
<p>Acostia, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are adapted to anchor in muddy substrates, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acostia is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
