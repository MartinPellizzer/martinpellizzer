                <h1>Adike allophyla</h1>
<p>Adike allophyla, commonly known as the red-flowered alpine plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Adike allophyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adike allophyla has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, light gray bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern through twining. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with four petals and five stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adike allophyla is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. The plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen growing along riverbanks and in coastal areas. It has also been reported in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Adike allophyla is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adike allophyla was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in these ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have led to its spread beyond initially planted areas.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect native biodiversity.</p>
