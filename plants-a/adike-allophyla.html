                    <h1>Adike allophyla</h1>
<p>Adike allophyla, commonly known as the red-flowered alpine plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Adike allophyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
