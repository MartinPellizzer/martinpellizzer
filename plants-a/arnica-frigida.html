                    <h1>Arnica frigida</h1>
<p>Arnica frigida, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, dark green leaves. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is often found at high altitudes. Its rhizomatous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Arnica frigida is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relative, Arnica montana.</p>
