                <h1>Acronychia scortechinii</h1>
<p>Acronychia scortechinii, commonly known as the rough-leaved acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain a single seed, and it is often found in dry, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Acronychia scortechinii is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia scortechinii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, clustered in inflorescences, and have a simple structure with five petals; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's habitat in coastal or moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia scortechinii is primarily native to the tropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and coastal areas where the climate is humid and the soil is rich in organic matter. This plant thrives in shaded environments and is often associated with riverine forests and coastal scrublands. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing shelter and food for various native fauna.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia scortechinii was mainly introduced to Australia, where it has established itself in various regions, particularly in the eastern and northern parts of the country.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and subtropical areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, urban areas, and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
