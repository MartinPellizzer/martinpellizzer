                <h1>Acrolasia veatchiana</h1>
<p>Acrolasia veatchiana, commonly known as Veatch's acrolasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is known for its limited distribution and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral structure and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia veatchiana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern as it ascends tree trunks. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia veatchiana is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in humid, moist environments with rich, organic soil. It is often associated with areas that have a high water table and is sometimes found in disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia veatchiana was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Florida and parts of Georgia. This plant is typically associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open areas. It has been reported in several counties in Florida, including Miami-Dade and Lee.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is monitored as a non-native species in these regions.</p>
