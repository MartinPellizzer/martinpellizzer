                    <h1>Atropis intermedia var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Atropis intermedia var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as high salinity and wind exposure. The plant features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting biodiversity in coastal ecosystems.</p>
