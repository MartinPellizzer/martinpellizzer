                    <h1>Angraecum brevicornu</h1>
<p>Angraecum brevicornu, commonly known as the short-horned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence bearing small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive white and violet coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Angraecum brevicornu is considered a conservation concern.</p>
