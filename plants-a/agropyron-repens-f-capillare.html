<p>Agropyron repens f. capillare, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, which make it well-suited for ground cover. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along pathways.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
