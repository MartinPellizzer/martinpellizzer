                    <h1>Axonopus bryoides</h1>
<p>Axonopus bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like vegetation that resembles moss due to its fine, soft blades and creeping growth habit. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikelets in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Axonopus bryoides is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
