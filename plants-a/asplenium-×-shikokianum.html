<p>Asplenium × shikokianum, commonly known as the Shikokian spleenwort, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to Japan, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
