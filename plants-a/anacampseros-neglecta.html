                    <h1>Anacampseros neglecta</h1>
<p>Anacampseros neglecta, commonly known as the desert pincushion, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Anacampseros neglecta is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
