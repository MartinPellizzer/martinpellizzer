                <h1>Aconitum autumnale</h1>
<p>Aconitum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive spurred shape, and it produces toxic alkaloids in its roots and tubers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often grown in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum autumnale has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures, growing upright and reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, arranged in a raceme, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, storing nutrients and helping the plant survive in its environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum autumnale is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Alps, Carpathians, and Apennines.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland, meadows, and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species is commonly found in countries such as Austria, Germany, Italy, and the Czech Republic. It is often associated with mixed forests and open areas with partial shade.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum autumnale was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its striking purple flowers and tall, dramatic growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas, becoming established in natural habitats along stream banks and moist woodlands. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Aconitum autumnale is considered invasive in some regions and requires careful management to prevent ecological harm.</p>
