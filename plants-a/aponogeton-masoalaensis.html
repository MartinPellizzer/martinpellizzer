<p>Aponogeton masoalaensis, commonly known as the Masoala water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like lobes. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
