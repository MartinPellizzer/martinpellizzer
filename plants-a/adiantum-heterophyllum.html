                <h1>Adiantum heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a contrasting lighter midrib. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained soil. Its fronds are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their graceful appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum heterophyllum is known for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum heterophyllum has fern-like leaves that are bi-lobed, pinnately divided, and have a delicate, lacey appearance, typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a slender, wiry stem that is smooth and slightly reddish in color. It does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant rather than a flowering plant. The sporangia are borne on the undersides of the leaves, and the plant relies on wind for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum heterophyllum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas and near streams. This fern is commonly associated with humid forests and is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. It is also occasionally reported in parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific microhabitats, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum heterophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is typically introduced as an ornamental due to its delicate, fern-like foliage. It has been reported in several countries outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited and it does not pose a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
