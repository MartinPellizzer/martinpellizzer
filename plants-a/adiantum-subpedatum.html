                <h1>Adiantum subpedatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum subpedatum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its rhizomes and fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum subpedatum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a feather-like structure, and arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length, and are dark green in color, often with a bluish tint. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subpedatum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with temperate forest ecosystems. It is particularly common in the eastern Appalachian region and the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution extends into some parts of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subpedatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. This species is often cultivated in gardens due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum subpedatum is considered an ornamental plant but can also naturalize in suitable environments.</p>
