                    <h1>Adiantum subpedatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum subpedatum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its rhizomes and fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes.</p>
