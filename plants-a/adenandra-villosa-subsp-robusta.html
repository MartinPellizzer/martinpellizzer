<p>Adenandra villosa subsp.</p>
<p>robusta, commonly known as the rough adenandra, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and woody stems, which provide structural support and aid in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
