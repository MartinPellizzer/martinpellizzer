                <h1>Adinandra obscurinervia</h1>
<p>Adinandra obscurinervia, commonly known as the dark-veined adinandra, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually elliptical with prominent, dark-colored veins, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Adinandra obscurinervia is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra obscurinervia has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have white petals with yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded forest soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra obscurinervia is primarily native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and hill forest regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. This species thrives in humid tropical climates and is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed areas. It is typically found in the understorey of forests, where it receives partial shade.</p>
<p>Adinandra obscurinervia is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra obscurinervia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and secondary growth forests, often as a result of human activities such as logging and land clearing.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where there is ample sunlight and moderate moisture levels. This plant is commonly found in the understory of lowland rainforests and can also colonize degraded habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions beyond its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
