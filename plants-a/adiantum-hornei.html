                <h1>Adiantum hornei</h1>
<p>Adiantum hornei, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with each pinna divided into smaller, linear segments.</p>
<p>Adiantum hornei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum hornei has fern-like leaves that are bi-lobed, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring up to 20 cm in length, with a bright green color that often turns bronze in the autumn. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light green bark that grows along the ground.</p>
<p>Adiantum hornei produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves; it does not produce true flowers, so pollination is not applicable. The plant does not produce fruits or seeds, as it reproduces through spores, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hornei is primarily native to Fiji.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in humid and shaded environments. This fern thrives in coastal areas and mountainous regions where the climate is warm and moist. It is often seen growing on rock faces or in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of the rich biodiversity found in Fiji's natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hornei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>However, it is considered non-native and has not been widely reported as invasive in the area.</p>
