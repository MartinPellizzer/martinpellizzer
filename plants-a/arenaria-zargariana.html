                    <h1>Arenaria zargariana</h1>
<p>Arenaria zargariana, commonly known as the Zargarian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria zargariana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine habitats.</p>
