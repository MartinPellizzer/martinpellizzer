                <h1>Actinomeris ovata</h1>
<p>Actinomeris ovata, commonly known as the oval bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic animals using specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders are inflated with air and can rapidly snap shut when prey touches their sensitive trigger hairs.</p>
<p>Actinomeris ovata typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinomeris ovata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a dull green color, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris ovata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded environments. The plant thrives in humid climates with high levels of precipitation throughout the year. It is often associated with the understory of dense tropical vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris ovata was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It was introduced to areas where native vegetation had been overgrown by non-native plants. The plant is often used in biological control programs due to its ability to thrive in wetland conditions. However, it can sometimes become invasive itself if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to regions with suitable wetland habitats.</p>
