                <h1>Acmella caulirhiza</h1>
<p>Acmella caulirhiza, commonly known as the shield flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a crown. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Acmella caulirhiza is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella caulirhiza has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella caulirhiza is primarily native to Benin, Burkina, Cameroon, Cape Provinces, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Gulf of Guinea Is., Ivory Coast, KwaZulu-Natal, Liberia, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, Northern Provinces, RÃ©union, Sudan-South Sudan, Togo, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with forest understories and wetlands. It is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some of these regions.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution across sub-Saharan Africa suggests adaptability to a variety of ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella caulirhiza was mainly introduced to Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. The introduction of this species may have occurred through human activities such as horticulture or accidental transport. It is considered an alien species in the region, potentially impacting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence highlights the need for monitoring invasive plant species in the Seychelles.</p>
