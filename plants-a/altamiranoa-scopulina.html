<p>Altamiranoa scopulina, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces such as stone and soil. The plant is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together carry out photosynthesis. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
