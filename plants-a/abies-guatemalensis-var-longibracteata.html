                    <h1>Abies guatemalensis var. longibracteata</h1>
<p>Abies guatemalensis var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract fir, is a rare and endemic species native to high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape, with dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces cones that are often longer and more robust than those of the typical *Abies guatemalensis*, with distinctive bract-like structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
