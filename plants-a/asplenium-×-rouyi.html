                    <h1>Asplenium × rouyi</h1>
<p>Asplenium × rouyi, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a membranous indusium. Asplenium × rouyi is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
