<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of chloroplasts and complex structures such as stomata and vascular tissue. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes vascular plants with a wide range of forms, from ferns to flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is known for its diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with bilateral symmetry and include legumes, which often form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pods and the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Abrus, a group of flowering plants that includes species known for their striking red seeds and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its species is Abrus somalensis, a specific plant species native to Somalia, known for its unique botanical features and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus somalensis is primarily native to Somalia.</p>
<p>This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. It thrives in dry savanna and woodland habitats. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus somalensis was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as parts of Africa and the Middle East. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its distinctive red seed pods.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
