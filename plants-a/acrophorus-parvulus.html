                <h1>Acrophorus parvulus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus parvulus, commonly known as the dwarf acrophorus, is a small shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus parvulus has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces tiny, clustered flowers with yellow petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus parvulus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich organic soil, often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. This plant is commonly associated with riverine and swampy environments due to its preference for moist conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific climatic and geographical zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus parvulus was mainly introduced to new habitats outside its native range, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions where it was not originally found, including parts of Europe and North America. The introduction of this plant has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>Monitoring its distribution is essential to assess its ecological impact.</p>
