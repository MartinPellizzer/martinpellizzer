                <h1>Acourtia thyrsoidea</h1>
<p>Acourtia thyrsoidea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to store moisture and thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acourtia thyrsoidea is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia thyrsoidea has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia thyrsoidea is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the Pacific coast. This species thrives in mild, coastal climates with moderate rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed or open habitats such as dunes and scrublands.</p>
<p>Acourtia thyrsoidea is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia thyrsoidea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or machinery.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in agricultural areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain environments.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
