                    <h1>Acourtia thyrsoidea</h1>
<p>Acourtia thyrsoidea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to store moisture and thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acourtia thyrsoidea is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
