                    <h1>Alnus glutinosa f. glabra</h1>
<p>Alnus glutinosa f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically 2â€“6 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered catkins in early spring, which are male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies, such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
