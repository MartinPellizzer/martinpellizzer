                <h1>Acmispon greenei</h1>
<p>Acmispon greenei, commonly known as the Greene's prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces pods that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Acmispon greenei is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon greenei has leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and ascending, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched until maturity. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient nutrient uptake in its native arid or semi-arid habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon greenei is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of California. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils in desert and semi-desert environments. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Acmispon greenei is often associated with chaparral and scrubland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon greenei was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun and well-drained soil, making it common in the western United States. This plant is often found in California, Nevada, and parts of Arizona. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and environmental conditions that favor its establishment.</p>
