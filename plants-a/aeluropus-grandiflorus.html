                <h1>Aeluropus grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus grandiflorus, commonly known as the broad-leaved saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal and saline environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear white or pale blue flowers, which are often clustered in dense heads. It is adapted to thrive in salty, arid conditions, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Aeluropus grandiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus grandiflorus has leaves that are linear, narrow, and grass-like, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is typically clumping or spreading. The flowers are spike-like, with small, white or pale blue florets that bloom in summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-angled capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant to anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
