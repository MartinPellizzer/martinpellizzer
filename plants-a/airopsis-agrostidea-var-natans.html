                    <h1>Airopsis agrostidea var. natans</h1>
<p>Airopsis agrostidea var. natans, commonly known as the floating sea lettuce, is a marine green alga that thrives in coastal waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ribbon-like, flattened thallus that floats on the surface of the water. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a single layer of cells. It reproduces through spores and is often found in brackish or saltwater environments.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of nutrient-rich, stable aquatic ecosystems.</p>
