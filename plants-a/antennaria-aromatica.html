<p>Antennaria aromatica, commonly known as sweet william, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces tiny, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Antennaria aromatica is also valued for its fragrant blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
