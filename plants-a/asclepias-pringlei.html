<p>Asclepias pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias pringlei is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for its larvae.</p>
<p>Its foliage contains milky sap, which is toxic to many herbivores but essential for the survival of certain insect species.</p>
