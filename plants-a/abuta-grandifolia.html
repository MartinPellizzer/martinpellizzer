<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a distinct life cycle and includes ferns and their relatives. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Ranunculales, which consists of flowering plants with diverse forms and includes families like the buttercup family. Its family is Menispermaceae, commonly known as the birthwort family, which includes climbing plants and some medicinal species. Its genus is Abuta, a group of flowering plants native to tropical regions, often characterized by their ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its species is Abuta grandifolia, a specific type within the genus Abuta, known for its large, showy flowers and potential medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abuta grandifolia is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>
