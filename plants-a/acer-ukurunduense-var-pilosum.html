                    <h1>Acer ukurunduense var. pilosum</h1>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. pilosum, commonly known as the pilose maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude forests of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green coloration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a compact form and dense foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
