                <h1>Aconitum sibiricum</h1>
<p>Aconitum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant has palmately divided, compound leaves that are typically deeply lobed. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum sibiricum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside, typically measuring up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and sturdy, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a single main stem. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, clustered in racemes, and have a spurred petal; they bloom in late summer to early autumn and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky, wind-dispersed appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sibiricum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates with well-drained soils. It is also present in the Russian Altai and Sayan mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into northern China, particularly in the Xinjiang region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sibiricum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since been found growing in various regions, particularly in moist, shaded areas of the Pacific Northwest. The plant has spread beyond cultivated gardens, establishing itself in natural habitats and posing a threat to native flora. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete local species.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Aconitum sibiricum is toxic and requires careful management to prevent its spread.</p>
