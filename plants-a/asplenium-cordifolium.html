<p>Asplenium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-shaped spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or under forest canopies, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a distinctive basal rosette structure that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Asplenium cordifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
