<p>Aegilops cylindrica f. prokhanovii, commonly known as the prokhanovii form, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat and its ecological resilience.</p>
