                <h1>Achillea pratensis</h1>
<p>Achillea pratensis, commonly known as field yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has feathery, aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its blooming period occurs from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pratensis has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish hue, growing in a clump-like pattern. The flowers are small, composite yellow blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pratensis is primarily native to Austria, Czechia-Slovakia, France, Germany, Italy, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., and Romania. This plant is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and open woodland areas across these regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous soils. Its distribution spans across Central and Eastern Europe, reflecting its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The species is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pratensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of early botanical introductions and landscape gardening efforts. This plant has since become naturalized in several areas, particularly in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides. It is often found in open habitats with partial shade and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species in certain ecosystems.</p>
