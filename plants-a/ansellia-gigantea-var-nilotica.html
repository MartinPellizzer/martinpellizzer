                    <h1>Ansellia gigantea var. nilotica</h1>
<p>Ansellia gigantea var. nilotica, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by fleshy, finger-like tubers used as a starchy food source. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and edible tubers make it both a horticultural and agricultural interest.</p>
