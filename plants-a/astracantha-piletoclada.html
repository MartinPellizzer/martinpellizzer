                    <h1>Astracantha piletoclada</h1>
<p>Astracantha piletoclada, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its leaves. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Astracantha piletoclada plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
