                    <h1>Arceuthobium epiviscum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium epiviscum, commonly known as the sticky false witchgrass, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily grasses.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit, which contains a sticky substance.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
