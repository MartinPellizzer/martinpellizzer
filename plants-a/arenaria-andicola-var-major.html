<p>Arenaria andicola var. major, commonly known as the Andean sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically dense and mat-forming, providing ground cover in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is an important species for studying plant resilience in extreme climates.</p>
