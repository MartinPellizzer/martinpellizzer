                    <h1>Artemisia saligna</h1>
<p>Artemisia saligna, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Artemisia saligna is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems and is an important component of the local flora.</p>
