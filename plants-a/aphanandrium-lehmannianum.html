<p>Aphanandrium lehmannianum, commonly known as the Lehmann's aphanandrium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Melanthiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to specific regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
