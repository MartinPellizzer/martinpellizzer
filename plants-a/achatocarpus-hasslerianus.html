                    <h1>Achatocarpus hasslerianus</h1>
<p>Achatocarpus hasslerianus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has a complex root system, including prop roots that help in anchoring it in soft, waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, producing fruits that are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
