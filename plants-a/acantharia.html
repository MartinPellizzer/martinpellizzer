                    <h1>Acantharia</h1>
<p>Acantharia, commonly known as a group of marine protists, are characterized by their unique siliceous skeletal structures.</p>
<p>These organisms belong to the order Acantharia, which includes several species with intricate, spiky shells. They are typically found in coastal waters and are known for their ability to form complex, ornate tests. Acantharia play a role in marine ecosystems as part of the plankton community.</p>
<p>Their study contributes to our understanding of protist diversity and evolution.</p>
