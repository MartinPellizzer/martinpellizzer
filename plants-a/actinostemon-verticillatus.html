                <h1>Actinostemon verticillatus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon verticillatus, commonly known as the whorled stemless sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in a whorled arrangement at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon verticillatus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon verticillatus is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the humid tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in shaded undergrowth within forested environments. The plant is adapted to the warm and moist climate characteristic of these regions.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to these specific areas within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon verticillatus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open environments. The plant has shown adaptability to various soil types, which contributes to its successful establishment in non-native regions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its invasive potential in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping.</p>
