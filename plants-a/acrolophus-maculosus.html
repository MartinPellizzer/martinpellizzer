                <h1>Acrolophus maculosus</h1>
<p>Acrolophus maculosus, commonly known as the spotted acrolophus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disk florets and white to pale pink ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Acrolophus maculosus is often found in temperate regions of the southern United States.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophus maculosus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus maculosus is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats across these regions. The plant thrives in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed or marginal lands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the African continent, with no recorded presence elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus maculosus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and travel.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Africa and the Middle East. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, making it well-suited for colonization in urban and agricultural areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
