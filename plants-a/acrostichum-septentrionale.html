                <h1>Acrostichum septentrionale</h1>
<p>Acrostichum septentrionale, commonly known as the northern sword fern, is a perennial fern native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The leaves are evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum septentrionale has large, broad, leathery leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are thick and woody, with a rough, dark brown bark that has a fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are greenish-yellow in color and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dark, spherical drupe that contains a single seed, dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and anchor firmly in wetland soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum septentrionale is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in southern Florida, USA, and extends into Central America. This fern thrives in coastal areas, often growing on mangrove roots or in brackish wetlands. It is well adapted to saline and humid environments, making it a common sight in tropical coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the western Atlantic coastal zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum septentrionale was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, saline environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. This plant has been documented in several coastal states, including Texas and Louisiana, where it adapts well to brackish water conditions. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities such as coastal development and landfills.</p>
<p>However, its presence has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems in these areas.</p>
