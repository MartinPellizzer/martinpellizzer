                    <h1>Aster reptans</h1>
<p>Aster reptans, commonly known as the creeping aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Aster reptans is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
