                    <h1>Amphistelma leptocarpa</h1>
<p>Amphistelma leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Amphistelma leptocarpa is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
