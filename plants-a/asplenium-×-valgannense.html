                    <h1>Asplenium × valgannense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × valgannense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × valgannense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
