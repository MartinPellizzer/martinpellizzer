<p>Alnus glutinosa var. sorbifolia, commonly known as the sticky alder or sweet alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape with serrated edges. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
