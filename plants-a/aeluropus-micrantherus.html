                <h1>Aeluropus micrantherus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus micrantherus, commonly known as the small-flowered saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. It is adapted to withstand high salinity and drought conditions, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration in coastal and desert regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh environments highlights its importance in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in saline habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus micrantherus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense tufts. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed having a fine, hairy appendage for aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or saline soils and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
