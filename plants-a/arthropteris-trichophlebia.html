<p>Arthropteris trichophlebia, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Arthropteris trichophlebia plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
