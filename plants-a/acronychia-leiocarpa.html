                <h1>Acronychia leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Acronychia leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruited acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fruits and has small, simple leaves with a leathery texture. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often in lowland rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia leiocarpa has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, greyish bark that develops fissures with age, and it exhibits a sympodial growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia leiocarpa is primarily native to northern and eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in rainforests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with lowland and hill forests. It is also present in some parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Acronychia leiocarpa is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia leiocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and lowland forests, often growing as a small to medium-sized tree. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, its population has been declining in some regions.</p>
