                    <h1>Aspidium molle</h1>
<p>Aspidium molle, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
