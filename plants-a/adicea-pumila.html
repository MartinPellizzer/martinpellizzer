                <h1>Adicea pumila</h1>
<p>Adicea pumila, commonly known as the smooth adicea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling dandelion-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adicea pumila thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea pumila has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically light green in color, with a smooth surface and a slightly pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters, with four petals and stamens, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and enabling the plant to thrive in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea pumila is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often associated with sandy or rocky soils. It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the Cape Floristic Region.</p>
<p>Adicea pumila is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of this region, with a dormant period during the winter months.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea pumila was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in coastal and disturbed areas, where it can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ongoing monitoring by environmental agencies to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
