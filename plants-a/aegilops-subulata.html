                <h1>Aegilops subulata</h1>
<p>Aegilops subulata, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, making it a dioecious species. Aegilops subulata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies related to wild relative species of wheat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops subulata has needle-like leaves that are slender, linear, and slightly curved, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-like form. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a caryopsis, with small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in dry, sandy soils.</p>
