                <h1>Achyrocline deflexa</h1>
<p>Achyrocline deflexa, commonly known as the creeping sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline deflexa has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to pale brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to reddish in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and helping the plant thrive in coastal or sandy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline deflexa is primarily native to Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Central America. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and along stream banks. Its distribution spans across various habitats within these countries.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline deflexa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. The plant has shown adaptability to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions, contributing to its spread. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological effects.</p>
