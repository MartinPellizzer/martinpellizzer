<p>Aspidium rockii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in rocky, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover.</p>
<p>Aspidium rockii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
