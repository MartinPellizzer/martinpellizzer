<p>Acmispon glaber var. brevialatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds.
