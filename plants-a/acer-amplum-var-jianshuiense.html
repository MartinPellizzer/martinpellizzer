                <h1>Acer amplum var. jianshuiense</h1>
<p>Acer amplum var. jianshuiense, commonly known as the Jianshui maple, is a variant of the common maple native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. jianshuiense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length; they are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with a winged seed that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, providing stability and efficient water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. jianshuiense is a rare variant of the horse chestnut tree native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous regions of southern Yunnan. This plant thrives in moist, temperate environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forest understories. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer amplum var. jianshuiense is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. jianshuiense is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings showing higher success rates. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5–7 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. jianshuiense is a unique plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local biodiversity and ecosystem health. This plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting other plant life. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that holds soil in place.</p>
<p>Its presence also aids in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and promoting the growth of surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. jianshuiense is a rare and unique maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically valued for crafting tools and furniture due to its durability. In traditional Chinese medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and perseverance, often featured in local art and literature.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and aesthetic appeal make it an important species for conservation and botanical study.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. jianshuiense has a limited number of recognized varieties, cultivars, and hybrids, primarily due to its native status in China.</p>
<p>Among its popular cultivars, 'Jianshui' and 'Zhongshan' are widely appreciated for their ornamental value and unique leaf patterns. While natural hybrids are rare, some horticulturalists have attempted crossbreeding with related maple species to enhance foliage color and growth habits. Its horticultural importance lies in its potential for landscape use, particularly in regions with mild climates.</p>
<p>However, further research and propagation efforts are needed to expand its cultivation and genetic diversity.</p>
