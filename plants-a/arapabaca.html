                    <h1>Arapabaca</h1>
<p>Arapabaca, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water.</p>
<p>Arapabaca plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
