                    <h1>Arabidopsis himalaica var. kunawurensis</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis himalaica var. kunawurensis, commonly known as the Kunawurensis thale, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species like Arabidopsis thaliana. This variant is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces small white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to Arabidopsis thaliana, it is of interest in botanical and genetic research.</p>
