                    <h1>Agrostis capillaris var. hispida</h1>
<p>Agrostis capillaris var. hispida, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and the presence of short, stiff hairs on its leaves and stems. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its role in ecological systems.</p>
<p>Hairy bentgrass is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing lawns.</p>
