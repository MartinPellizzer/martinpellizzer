<p>Anthericum rostratum, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily or the spear lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Anthericum rostratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage and subtle floral display.</p>
