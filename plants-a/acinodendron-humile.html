                <h1>Acinodendron humile</h1>
<p>Acinodendron humile, commonly known as the small acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acinodendron humile is often found in moist, shaded habitats within forests or along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron humile has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron humile is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, spiny forests of the eastern and southern regions of the island. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in sparse vegetation. It is an endemic species, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron humile was mainly introduced to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was introduced primarily for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region.</p>
