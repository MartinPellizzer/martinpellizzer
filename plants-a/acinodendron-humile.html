                <h1>Acinodendron humile</h1>
<p>Acinodendron humile, commonly known as the small-fruited acinodendron, is a small shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruits are small berries that mature to a reddish color, often containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron humile is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron humile has small, elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, low shrub form. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron humile is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in tropical rainforests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil, often found in the undergrowth of dense, primary forests. Acinodendron humile typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited research, its conservation status remains uncertain, with some populations possibly already extinct.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinodendron humile is a small, flowering plant native to tropical regions, known for its delicate appearance and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm climates with a dormant period during cooler months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season helps promote healthy growth, while regular pruning encourages bushier foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinodendron humile is a small shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acinodendron humile contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and resources to a range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinodendron humile is a small, flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa, known for its potential in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its leaves and roots are used in local remedies to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. While it has limited culinary use, it may be incorporated into some local dishes in specific communities. The plant also holds cultural significance in certain indigenous practices, symbolizing resilience or spiritual connection.</p>
<p>Due to its limited research and commercial cultivation, its industrial and economic applications remain underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinodendron humile has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Among the popular cultivars are 'Variegatum' and 'Compactum', which are prized for their unique foliage and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acinodendron humile are often created to enhance ornamental traits such as flower color and fragrance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to biodiversity and the beauty of cultivated plant collections.</p>
