                    <h1>Arundinella riparia</h1>
<p>Arundinella riparia, commonly known as the river reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Arundinella riparia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
