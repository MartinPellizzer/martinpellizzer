                <h1>Aegiphila vestita</h1>
<p>Aegiphila vestita, commonly known as the silky aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Aegiphila vestita is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and fragrant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila vestita has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy form. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky and arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
