                        <h1>Acalypha macrostachya f. puberula</h1>
<p>Acalypha macrostachya f. puberula, commonly known as velvetleaf or silky abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique floral structure.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macrostachya f. puberula is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. The species is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macrostachya f. puberula was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and urban areas. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It poses a threat to native vegetation by outcompeting local flora for resources.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in several areas of the region.</p>
