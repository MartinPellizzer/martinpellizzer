<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abuta cuspidata var. ovalifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The species is also occasionally reported in parts of Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
