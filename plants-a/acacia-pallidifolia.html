                        <h1>Acacia pallidifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia pallidifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in compact, globular inflorescences. Acacia pallidifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pallidifolia is primarily native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This species thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It is well adapted to dry climates with low rainfall.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its distinctive pale yellow flowers and is a common sight in the Sonoran Desert ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pallidifolia was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its distinctive silver-green foliage and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry landscapes. It has become naturalized in some areas, posing potential ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its spread requires careful management to prevent it from outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
