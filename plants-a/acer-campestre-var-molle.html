                        <h1>Acer campestre var. molle</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often grayish bark and opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, red to orange-red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental planting.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes contribute to its aesthetic value in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
