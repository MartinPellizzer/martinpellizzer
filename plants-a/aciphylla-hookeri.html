                <h1>Aciphylla hookeri</h1>
<p>Aciphylla hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's silvergrass, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aciphylla hookeri is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland scrublands.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important species in New Zealand's native flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla hookeri has small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a dense, woolly texture, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows upright from the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla hookeri is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. It is adapted to the harsh climate of these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the southern part of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla hookeri was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with coastal and inland dunes. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its introduced range.</p>
<p>Aciphylla hookeri is considered a native species in New Zealand but is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
