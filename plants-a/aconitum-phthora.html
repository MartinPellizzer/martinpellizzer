                <h1>Aconitum phthora</h1>
<p>Aconitum phthora, commonly known as the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive appearance that helps in identification.</p>
<p>Aconitum phthora contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum phthora has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to violet in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fleshy, adapted for storage and survival in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum phthora is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. This species is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of these regions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soil.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally reported in the western parts of the Russian Federation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum phthora was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates where it can thrive in shaded woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It was first documented in North America in the early 20th century, likely through accidental introduction via contaminated soil or plant material. This plant has since spread to several regions, including parts of the northeastern and Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is also cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
