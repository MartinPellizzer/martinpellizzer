                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. grandis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. grandis, commonly known as the large-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, velvety, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps to retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
