<p>Alnus februaria var. sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian alder, is a variant of the common alder native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in wind-pollinated species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
