                    <h1>Acrostichum appendiculatum var. costulatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum appendiculatum var. costulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple fronds that are often divided into small, delicate segments.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
