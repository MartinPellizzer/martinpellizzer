<p>Asperula aristata f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hair in the species, though this form is glabrous, or hairless. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to shady garden spaces.</p>
