                        <h1>Abronia gracilis subsp. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Abronia gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>platyphylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>platyphylla is primarily native to the coastal areas of southern California, including parts of Baja California, Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with mild, temperate climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in dune environments and coastal scrub habitats. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding from the ocean.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>platyphylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in regions of California and Baja California, where it has established populations in disturbed or open habitats. It is often associated with maritime climates and can tolerate salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>
