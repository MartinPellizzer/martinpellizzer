<p>Anacampseros schoenlandii, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage composed of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
