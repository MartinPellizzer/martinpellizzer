<p>Adicea kakurang, commonly known as the purple-leafed hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant purple leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Adicea kakurang is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea kakurang has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five white petals and a yellowish-green center, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea kakurang is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with high levels of rainfall. It is often seen growing in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat supports a wide variety of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea kakurang was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant has been observed spreading rapidly in disturbed ecosystems, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade natural habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in erosion control due to its fast growth rate.</p>
