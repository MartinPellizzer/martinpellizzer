                <h1>Actinodaphne spathulifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits. Its bark is thick and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne spathulifolia has elliptical to ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is typically slender and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with yellow stamens and a greenish-white pistil, blooming during the rainy season and relying on insects for pollination. Its fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne spathulifolia is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and hill forests of the island, particularly in areas with moist and humid climates. This species thrives in tropical rainforest environments, often growing in the understory where it receives dappled sunlight. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is part of the rich biodiversity of Borneo's flora.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne spathulifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks in Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This plant is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves and is used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in new habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive nature.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains largely undocumented.</p>
