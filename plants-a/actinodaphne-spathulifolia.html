                <h1>Actinodaphne spathulifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark blue or black berries. It is valued for its aromatic wood and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne spathulifolia has elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a mild fragrance when broken. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in spikes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded forest soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne spathulifolia is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Indochina Peninsula and the islands of the Malay Archipelago. It thrives in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas, often near rivers and in humid, shaded environments. This species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Actinodaphne spathulifolia is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne spathulifolia is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, prized for its ornamental foliage and aromatic qualities.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable and faster. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like ferns or hibiscus can enhance its growth and create a lush, tropical garden setting.</p>
