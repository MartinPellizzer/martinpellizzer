                    <h1>Angraecum modicum</h1>
<p>Angraecum modicum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the small angraecum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocky surfaces rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators like moths. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful cultivation.</p>
