                    <h1>Armeria duriaei var. seticaulis</h1>
<p>Armeria duriaei var. seticaulis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky coastlines of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
