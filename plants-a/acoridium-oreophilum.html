                <h1>Acoridium oreophilum</h1>
<p>Acoridium oreophilum, commonly known as the mountain acorus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acoraceae family and is characterized by its broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of aquatic and wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium oreophilum has leaves that are elongated, narrow, and sword-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium oreophilum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats within lowland and hill forest environments. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often near streams or in swampy areas. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium oreophilum was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction is largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various microclimates.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
