                <h1>Achillea alexandri-borzae</h1>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae, commonly known as Alexandrian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountains of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It features finely divided, silver-gray foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a dark green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and pale yellow disk florets, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae is a rare flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Transylvanian Alps. It thrives in open, sunny meadows and rocky slopes with well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,200 and 1,800 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae is a perennial plant known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a typical perennial growth cycle, thriving in full sun and producing flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and small birds, by offering both floral resources and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic compounds. Additionally, its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea alexandri-borzae plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is primarily of interest in botanical research due to its unique genetic makeup and potential for ecological studies. While it may not have widespread culinary or medicinal applications, it could be used in traditional herbal practices in certain regions. Its role in industrial applications is minimal, though it might contribute to local biodiversity and habitat support.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in the regions where it naturally occurs, though this is not well-documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea,' which are known for their vibrant foliage and floral displays. While there are limited hybrids specifically developed for this species, it is often crossed with other achillea varieties to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of conditions and its long blooming period.</p>
<p>It is a valuable addition to gardens, contributing to both visual appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
