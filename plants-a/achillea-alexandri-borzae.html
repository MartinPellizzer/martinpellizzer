                <h1>Achillea alexandri-borzae</h1>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae, commonly known as Alexandri's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique addition to alpine and rock garden landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a pale green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are compound umbels with small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule containing small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, specifically found in parts of Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Carpathian Mountains. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and grasslands. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, Achillea alexandri-borzae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae is a striking perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a typical herbaceous growth cycle, blooming in midsummer and dying back in winter, with new growth emerging in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or rust in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-borzae is a lesser-known plant that has limited documented uses and applications compared to more widely studied members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary contexts, it may have potential for local herbal remedies in traditional medicine. Its role in industrial or economic applications is minimal, as it is not cultivated on a large scale for commercial purposes. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions, though specific meanings are not well-documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely understudied, with more research needed to fully understand its potential uses.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Achillea alexandri-borzaa has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Papaveracea' and 'Papaveracea Compacta', which are known for their pale pink to white flowers and compact growth habit. Hybrids of this species are often developed to enhance traits such as flower color, disease resistance, and adaptability to different climates. These plants hold horticultural importance as they are used in gardens for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to the diversity of garden flora, especially in regions with temperate climates.</p>
