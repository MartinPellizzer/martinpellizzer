<p>Arctium lappa var. pubens, commonly known as the hairy burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, thick stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often covered with coarse, hairy texture. The plant produces large, spiky flower heads that are covered in bracts, which are modified leaves that protect the small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a rough, hairy surface.</p>
<p>The root, which is thick and fleshy, is the primary part used in traditional herbal medicine and is often harvested in the second year of growth.</p>
