<p>Asplenium laui, commonly known as the Laui's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Asplenium laui is a relatively rare species, often found in specific geographic regions with particular microclimates.</p>
