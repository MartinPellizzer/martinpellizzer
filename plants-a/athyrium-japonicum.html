<p>Athyrium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that is native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread gradually.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
