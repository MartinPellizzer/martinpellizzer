                <h1>Adenostemma lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Adenostemma lanceolatum is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it a hardy and adaptable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma lanceolatum has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 3–8 cm long and 0.5–1.5 cm wide, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to fall and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma lanceolatum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and grasslands. This plant thrives in regions with Mediterranean climates characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from California to Texas and into parts of Arizona and New Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma lanceolatum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas, becoming established in various disturbed sites and open habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a range of soil types have contributed to its invasion potential in native ecosystems. It is considered a noxious weed in some regions, posing a threat to native plant communities and agricultural lands.</p>
<p>Management efforts often focus on early detection and control to prevent its further spread.</p>
