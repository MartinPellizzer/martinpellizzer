<p>Arceuthobium globosum subsp.</p>
<p>aureum, commonly known as the golden dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily on the roots of certain grass species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique method of seed dispersal through a mechanism called "expulsion," where seeds are launched from the fruit. It is often found in temperate regions and is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitats.</p>
