                <h1>Acmella glaberrima</h1>
<p>Acmella glaberrima, commonly known as the yellow marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and has hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella glaberrima has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, waxy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with few branches. Its flowers are small, yellowish-orange, and have a distinctive cup-like structure with five petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella glaberrima is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Chile Central, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in these regions, growing in a variety of habitats including grasslands and open areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The distribution of Acmella glaberrima is closely associated with the ecosystems of these South American countries.</p>
<p>Its presence in these regions highlights its adaptation to the local environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella glaberrima was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and lowland areas. Its introduction has sometimes led to its naturalization in certain regions, where it can compete with native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
