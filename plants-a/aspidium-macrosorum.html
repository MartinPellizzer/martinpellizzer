<p>Aspidium macrosorum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
