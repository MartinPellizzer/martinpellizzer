                    <h1>Aechmea caudata var. variegata</h1>
<p>Aechmea caudata var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Sword Fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright inflorescence that bears vibrant red bracts, which contrast beautifully with its dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant's rosette of leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
