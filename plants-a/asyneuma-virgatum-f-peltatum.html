                    <h1>Asyneuma virgatum f. peltatum</h1>
<p>Asyneuma virgatum f. peltatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved goldenweed, is a variant of the goldenweed species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role.</p>
