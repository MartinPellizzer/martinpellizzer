                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. pacifica</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. pacifica, commonly known as Pacific yarrow, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often silver-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white, pink, or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. pacifica has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits a clump-forming growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish quickly in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. pacifica is a variant of the common yarrow, native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in regions of Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the United States and Canada, expanding its current distribution. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its widespread presence and adaptability, it is not considered threatened and has a stable conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. pacifica is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental foliage and long-lasting flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a typical biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. pacifica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also offers shelter and habitat for various insects and small wildlife species. This plant acts as an effective companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. pacifica is a perennial herb known for its ornamental value and various practical uses.</p>
