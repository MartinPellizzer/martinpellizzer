                    <h1>Alyssum halacsyi f. densum</h1>
<p>Alyssum halacsyi f. densum, commonly known as the dense alpine alyssum, is a compact, mat-forming plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
