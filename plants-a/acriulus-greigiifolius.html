                <h1>Acriulus greigiifolius</h1>
<p>Acriulus greigiifolius, commonly known as the greenleaf acanthus, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of tubular, showy flowers in shades of red, purple, and orange, which bloom in the summer months. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriulus greigiifolius has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow with five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriulus greigiifolius is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Oaxaca, Puebla, and Veracruz. This species thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is adapted to the cool, moist climates of these areas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriulus greigiifolius was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of a botanical experiment to assess its adaptability to local climates. The plant has since spread beyond its initial planting sites, establishing itself in various moist, woodland areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains a subject of study for its ecological impact and resilience.</p>
