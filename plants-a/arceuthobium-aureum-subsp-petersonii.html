<p>Arceuthobium aureum subsp.</p>
<p>petersonii, commonly known as the Peterson's dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is typically found growing on the roots of various grasses and forbs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its parasitic nature, it does not have true leaves or stems, relying solely on its host for survival.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence and health of its host plant.</p>
