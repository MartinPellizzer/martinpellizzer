<p>Alchemilla ypsilotoma, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences.

<p>The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to retain moisture and reduce water loss.</p>
