                    <h1>Aspidium spinulosum var. americanum</h1>
<p>Aspidium spinulosum var. americanum, commonly known as the American water fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive spinulose (spiny) texture along the margins.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to aquatic environments, playing a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
