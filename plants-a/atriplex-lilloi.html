                    <h1>Atriplex lilloi</h1>
<p>Atriplex lilloi, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Atriplex lilloi is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
