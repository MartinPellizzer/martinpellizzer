                        <h1>Acer marsicum f. trifidum</h1>
<p>Acer marsicum f. trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its uniquely divided leaves, which have three deep lobes, giving it a striking appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Alps, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes it a valuable subject for both horticultural study and ecological research.</p>
