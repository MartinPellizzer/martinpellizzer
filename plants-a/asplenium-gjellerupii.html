                    <h1>Asplenium gjellerupii</h1>
<p>Asplenium gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, it thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in rocky or forested areas with high moisture levels.</p>
