<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have a well-developed vascular system and show a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with diverse morphological features and ecological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "caper bushes," characterized by their often hairy leaves and showy flowers.</p>

<p>Acalypha chorisandra is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within dense forests. It is commonly associated with humid environments and is part of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the southeastern part of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chorisandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential environmental weed because of its ability to thrive in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
