                <h1>Aconitum pyrenaicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pyrenees mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers. The plant has dark green, doubly pinnate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Aconitum pyrenaicum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a plant to be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pyrenaicum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and bluish-green, growing to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in a raceme, blooming from July to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle containing small, black, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pyrenaicum is primarily native to the Pyrenees Mountains, spanning parts of France, Spain, and Andorra.</p>
<p>It grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. This plant is commonly found in meadows, slopes, and forest edges within its native range. It thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Aconitum pyrenaicum is known for its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pyrenaicum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including wetlands and disturbed sites. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native flora.</p>
