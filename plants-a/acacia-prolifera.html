                        <h1>Acacia prolifera</h1>
<p>Acacia prolifera, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Acacia prolifera plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia prolifera is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland dune environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia prolifera is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia prolifera was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and stabilize sand dunes in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant has been introduced in several countries across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Australia. However, its rapid growth and spread have led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
