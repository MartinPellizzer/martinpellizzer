<p>Argythamnia discolor, commonly known as the pale thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough texture. Argythamnia discolor is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and can be used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
