<p>Agrostis dshungarica, commonly known as the Siberian meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia, including parts of Russia and China.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted blades with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Agrostis dshungarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
