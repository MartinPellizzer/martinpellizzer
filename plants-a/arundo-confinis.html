                    <h1>Arundo confinis</h1>
<p>Arundo confinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and riparian zones, and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Arundo confinis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in basket-making.</p>
