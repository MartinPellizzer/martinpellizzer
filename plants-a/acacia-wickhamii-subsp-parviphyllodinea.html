<p>Acacia wickhamii subsp.</p>
<p>parviphyllodinea, commonly known as the small-leaf wickham acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are often visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand prolonged drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>
