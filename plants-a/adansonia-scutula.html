                <h1>Adansonia scutula</h1>
<p>Adansonia scutula, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a striking member of the Bombacaceae family native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The tree can grow up to 25 meters tall with thick, fibrous bark that provides protection against fire and pests. Its large, pale green leaves are palmate, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that contains edible seeds and is an important resource for both wildlife and local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia scutula has leaves that are palmate, with five to seven leaflets arranged radiating from a central point, each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, green in color, and varying in size from 10 to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a solitary tree with a broad, rounded crown. The flowers are large, yellowish-green with a red or purple stigma, clustered in panicles, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the tree to access water from deep underground and stabilize it in the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia scutula is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry deciduous forests and spiny forests of the island. This species thrives in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is commonly seen in the southern and western parts of Madagascar.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia scutula was mainly introduced to regions with a warm, arid climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in semi-desert environments. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand extreme weather conditions. Its introduction has been particularly beneficial in regions where traditional crops struggle to grow.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent overgrowth and ensure ecological balance.</p>
