<p>Aegilops aucheri f. nudiglumis, commonly known as the naked lemma aegilops, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Its unique feature is the absence of glumes on the spikelets, giving it the "nudiglumis" designation, which means "naked glumes" in Latin.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential in ecological restoration.</p>
