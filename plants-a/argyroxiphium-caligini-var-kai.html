<p>Argyroxiphium caligini var. kai, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray, sword-like leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms once in its lifetime. The plant thrives in the high-elevation, volcanic soils of the Haleakalā crater, where it is adapted to cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and historical threats, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
