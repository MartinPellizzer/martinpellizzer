<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. rigida, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in ecological restoration projects.</p>
