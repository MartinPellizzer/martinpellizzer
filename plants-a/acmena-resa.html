                <h1>Acmena resa</h1>
<p>Acmena resa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.</p>
<p>Acmena resa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena resa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a subtle pinkish tinge, featuring five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and subsequent excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena resa is primarily native to the eastern regions of Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically along riverbanks or in dense forest understoreys. It is part of the family Sterculiaceae and is known for its attractive, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Acmena resa is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to the biodiversity of the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena resa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been reported to spread rapidly in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact is still being studied.</p>
