                <h1>Aegiphila pyramidata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid leaf aegiphila, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila pyramidata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that has a slight ridged texture, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with tubular corollas that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
