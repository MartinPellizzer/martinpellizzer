<p>Acer campestre f. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping wood sorrel, is a distinctive cultivar of the common maple.</p>
<p>It features a cascading growth habit with delicate, drooping branches that create a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, trifoliate leaves that are typically a vibrant green, and it blooms with inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. pendulum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 3â€“6 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient uptake from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. pendulum is a cultivar of the European hedge maple, known for its weeping growth habit.</p>
<p>Native to western Europe, it originally grew in the wild across countries such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Today, it is widely cultivated in gardens and parks throughout temperate regions, including North America and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade, typically found at low to mid-altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters.</p>
