                <h1>Adenosacme stipulata</h1>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and dark green color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent. This species thrives in moist, shaded forest environments, typically along stream banks and in undergrowth. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although habitat loss due to deforestation poses a potential threat to its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata is a hardy, low-maintenance plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The growth cycle of Adenosacme stipulata is relatively short, with rapid vegetative growth followed by flowering in the second year.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
