                <h1>Adenosacme stipulata</h1>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate adenosacme, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous small, dry seeds.</p>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, with five petals and a tubular throat, blooming in spring and relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Free State province. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, sand dunes, and rocky outcrops. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy species in these regions.</p>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata is often seen in open vegetation types such as savannas and thicket formations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme stipulata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in temperate climates, particularly in parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has led to its spread in invasive plant communities, sometimes outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a problematic species in certain ecosystems.</p>
