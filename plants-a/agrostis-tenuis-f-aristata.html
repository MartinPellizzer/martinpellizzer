                    <h1>Agrostis tenuis f. aristata</h1>
<p>Agrostis tenuis f. aristata, commonly known as the slender bentgrass with awns, is a variant of the slender bentgrass species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like turf. The plant is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and the presence of awns on its florets, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
