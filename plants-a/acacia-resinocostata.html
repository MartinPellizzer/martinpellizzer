                    <h1>Acacia resinocostata</h1>
<p>Acacia resinocostata, commonly known as the coast acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and phyllodes that are linear to narrowly elliptic. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically followed by flat, leathery pods. Acacia resinocostata is known for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its resinous sap has historically been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive.</p>
