                <h1>Adenia spinosa</h1>
<p>Adenia spinosa, commonly known as the spiked adenia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia spinosa is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia spinosa has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and they grow in a scrambling or shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white or pale yellow petals and a distinctive, spiky calyx, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red or orange drupe that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by animals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia spinosa is primarily native to Botswana, Northern Provinces, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the dry savanna and woodland regions of these areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open grasslands. Adenia spinosa is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia spinosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its invasive tendencies.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
