                    <h1>Aleuritia aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Aleuritia aurantiaca, commonly known as the red-flowered elder, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Aleuritia aurantiaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage and striking fruit display.</p>
