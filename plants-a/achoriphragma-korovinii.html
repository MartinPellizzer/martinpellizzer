                <h1>Achoriphragma korovinii</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma korovinii, commonly known as the Korovin's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma korovinii is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma korovinii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a bushy growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma korovinii is primarily native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is found in areas such as Scandinavia, the British Isles, and parts of northern Russia. This plant typically grows in rocky and coastal environments, often in areas with strong winds and low temperatures. It is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and is commonly found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches where it can thrive in cold, nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma korovinii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Despite its aesthetic value, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. The plant is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it can spread readily.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced species in the region.</p>
