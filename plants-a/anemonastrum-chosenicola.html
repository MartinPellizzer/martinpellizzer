<p>Anemonastrum chosenicola, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum chosenicola is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to desert ecosystems.</p>
