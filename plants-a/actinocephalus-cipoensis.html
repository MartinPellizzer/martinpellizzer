                <h1>Actinocephalus cipoensis</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo's starhead, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, colorful flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus cipoensis is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus cipoensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, light brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus cipoensis is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa, specifically in countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in the undergrowth, often near the base of tall trees where it can access the necessary moisture and nutrients. It plays a role in the local biodiversity and is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution is becoming increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus cipoensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. This plant has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in varied conditions contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
