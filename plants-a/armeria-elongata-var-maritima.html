                    <h1>Armeria elongata var. maritima</h1>
<p>Armeria elongata var. maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal areas of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Sea thrift is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils while providing ornamental value.</p>
