                        <h1>Acantholimon fetissovii</h1>
<p>Acantholimon fetissovii, commonly known as the Feticsov's thornstep, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon fetissovii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
