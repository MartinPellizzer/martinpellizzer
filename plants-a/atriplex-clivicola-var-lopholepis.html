                    <h1>Atriplex clivicola var. lopholepis</h1>
<p>Atriplex clivicola var. lopholepis, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid and saline environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates high salinity and wind exposure. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
