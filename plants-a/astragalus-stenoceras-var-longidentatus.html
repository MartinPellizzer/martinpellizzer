                    <h1>Astragalus stenoceras var. longidentatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus stenoceras var. longidentatus, commonly known as the long-toothed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several small, rounded seeds, typical of many Astragalus species. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its distinctive, elongated teeth on the leaflets, which distinguish it from other members of the species.</p>
