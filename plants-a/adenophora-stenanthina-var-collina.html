<p>Adenophora stenanthina var. collina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora stenanthina var. collina has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and hairy, with a pale green color and a creeping growth habit that often forms mats. The flowers are bell-shaped, with five lobes, and are typically pale blue to lavender, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora stenanthina var. collina is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few remote areas in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora stenanthina var. collina is a low-maintenance perennial known for its delicate, bell-shaped flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of established clumps, with the best results achieved in spring or early autumn. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer, then entering a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, moist soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its ornamental appeal in shaded garden areas.</p>
