                    <h1>Athyrium changbaishanense</h1>
<p>Athyrium changbaishanense, commonly known as the Changbai Mountain Athyrium, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
