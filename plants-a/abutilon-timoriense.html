<p>Abutilon timoriense, commonly known as the Timor Abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the island of Timor.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Abutilon timoriense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon timoriense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a bushy habit. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petal-like bracts that are yellowish-green to orange in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it to absorb nutrients and water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon timoriense is a flowering plant native to the island of Timor, specifically in Indonesia and East Timor.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Abutilon timoriense is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon timoriense is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in temperatures above 60°F (15°C) and entering dormancy in cooler conditions.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage bushier growth. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
