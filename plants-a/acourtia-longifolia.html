                <h1>Acourtia longifolia</h1>
<p>Acourtia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair.</p>
<p>Acourtia longifolia is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia longifolia has leaves that are narrow, elongated, and slightly serrated, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, greyish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia longifolia is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often in desert environments. Acourtia longifolia is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the native flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia longifolia was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California, particularly in the northern and central regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with moderate to high salinity. This plant is commonly found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its aggressive growth and potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
