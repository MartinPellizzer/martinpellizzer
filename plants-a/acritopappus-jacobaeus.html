                <h1>Acritopappus jacobaeus</h1>
<p>Acritopappus jacobaeus, commonly known as Jacob's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus jacobaeus has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with lanceolate leaflets that are usually serrated, green in color, and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, with a structure consisting of a single pistil and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, two-winged achene that is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus jacobaeus is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in specific ecological conditions. It is commonly associated with rocky and sandy soils in this area. The species is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this geographic area, making it a regionally significant plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus jacobaeus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ecological restoration project aimed at stabilizing degraded soils. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, making it suitable for reclamation efforts. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, monitoring its spread is essential to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
