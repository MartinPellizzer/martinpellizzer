                <h1>Aegiphila guianensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Guyanas and northern Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pink or purple and are clustered in whorls along the stems.</p>
<p>Aegiphila guianensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila guianensis has compound leaves that are pinnate, with small, lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, typically measuring up to 5 cm in length and displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
