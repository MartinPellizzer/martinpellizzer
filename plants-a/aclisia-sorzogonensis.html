                <h1>Aclisia sorzogonensis</h1>
<p>Aclisia sorzogonensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia sorzogonensis has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, bark-like texture, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia sorzogonensis is primarily native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Luzon.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of northern Luzon, particularly in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level. It is commonly associated with rocky slopes and secondary growth areas within its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia sorzogonensis was mainly introduced to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It has been reported in several regions including Luzon, Mindanao, and Palawan.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
