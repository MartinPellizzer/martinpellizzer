                    <h1>Adiantum capillus-veneris var. laciniatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum capillus-veneris var. laciniatum, commonly known as the "veil-tail fern," is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble a flowing veil, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, shaded garden setting.</p>
