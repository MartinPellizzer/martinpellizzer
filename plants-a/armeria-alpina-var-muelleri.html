                    <h1>Armeria alpina var. muelleri</h1>
<p>Armeria alpina var. muelleri, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has gray-green, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh climates.</p>
