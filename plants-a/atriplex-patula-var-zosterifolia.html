<p>Atriplex patula var. zosterifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, aiding in water conservation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
