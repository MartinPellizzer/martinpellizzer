                    <h1>Acrostichum caespitosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted fern or dwarf chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to form clumps of small, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
