                <h1>Acmella poliolepidica</h1>
<p>Acmella poliolepidica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pattypan, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, sunny habitats. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance.</p>
<p>The species is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella poliolepidica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly hairy, with a pale green bark that becomes rough as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white, and borne in clusters, featuring a unique structure with a hood-like bract, and they bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella poliolepidica is primarily native to Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is known for its small, colorful flowers and is often found in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to Central America, where it thrives in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella poliolepidica was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>However, its spread is carefully managed to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
