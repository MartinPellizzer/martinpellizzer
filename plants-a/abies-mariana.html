                        <h1>Abies mariana</h1>
<p>Abies mariana, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to northern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive silvery-blue foliage. The needles are flat, soft, and arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are typically cylindrical and range in color from green to reddish-brown.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies mariana is primarily native to the boreal forests of Canada and the northern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Alaska, the Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. This species thrives in cold climates with long winters and short growing seasons. It often grows in well-drained soils and is a key component of the taiga ecosystem.</p>
<p>Abies mariana is also known as the white spruce and is adapted to harsh northern environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies mariana was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in regions with cold climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in boreal and subarctic environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. This species is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh conditions. It has also been introduced to parts of Europe and Asia for ornamental and ecological purposes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
