                <h1>Adiantum elatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum elatum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often bright green and slightly curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum elatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum elatum has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a feathered pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and are a bright green color, often with a bluish tinge. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a branching pattern. Adiantum elatum does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum elatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This fern thrives in mountainous areas and is frequently associated with forest understories. It is also known to occur in parts of Japan and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes stream sides, rock crevices, and humid woodlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum elatum was mainly introduced to gardens and indoor spaces due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it is cultivated for its delicate, fern-like foliage. This plant is often used in water features and as a ground cover because of its spreading habit and ease of maintenance. Its introduction has led to its presence in various horticultural collections around the world.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is not typically invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
