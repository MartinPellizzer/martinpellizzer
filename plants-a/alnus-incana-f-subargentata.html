<p>Alnus incana f. subargentata, commonly known as the silverleaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its silvery-white underside leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to regions of North America and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a distinctive silvery sheen due to dense pubescence. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
