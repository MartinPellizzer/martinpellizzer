                <h1>Acmella alba var. ecuadorensis</h1>
<p>Acmella alba var. ecuadorensis, commonly known as the white spurge or yellow puffer, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that resemble small pufferfish, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its compact growth habit and vibrant coloration. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to produce a mild irritant when touched, similar to other members of the genus Acmella.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. ecuadorensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dull green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellow with a distinctive white center, and have a short blooming period during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. ecuadorensis is a rare flowering plant native to the western slopes of the Andes in Ecuador.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily restricted to the coastal and lowland regions of Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Currently, its distribution is limited to a few specific locations within its native habitat due to habitat loss and fragmentation. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variant is considered endangered due to its limited range and threats from deforestation and habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. ecuadorensis is a tropical flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, typically blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, and pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage more blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. ecuadorensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops through its allelopathic properties. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. ecuadorensis is a lesser-known plant with potential applications across various fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it may be used as a flavoring agent or in traditional recipes due to its unique taste. Medicinally, it has been explored for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, though more research is needed. Industrially, its compounds could be valuable in the development of natural pesticides or pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds significance in certain regions where it is used in rituals or as a symbol of resilience.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acmella alba var. ecuadorensis has several popular cultivars that are prized for their vibrant yellow or orange flowers, such as 'Sundance' and 'Golden Glow', which are commonly used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>While it is not widely hybridized due to its specific genetic traits, some horticulturalists have attempted to cross it with other acmella species to enhance flower color and growth habits. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in sunny conditions and its role in adding a bold, eye-catching element to garden landscapes. The plant is also valued for its tolerance to dry soils and its use in xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it has become a favored choice for both novice and experienced gardeners.</p>
