<p>Astragalus retroflexus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Astragalus retroflexus has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its distribution across various habitats.</p>
