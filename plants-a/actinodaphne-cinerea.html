                <h1>Actinodaphne cinerea</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne cinerea, commonly known as the grey-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in traditional medicine and aromatherapy.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cinerea has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a pale, sometimes whitish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, clustered in panicles, and bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy pulp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cinerea is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this archipelago. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and mountainous areas. It is commonly observed in the Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao regions.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is valued for its aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cinerea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests or along coastal areas. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of ecological conditions. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
