                        <h1>Acalypha digyneia</h1>
<p>Acalypha digyneia, commonly known as the two-seeded glory flower, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that form showy inflorescences, often displaying vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acalypha digyneia is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha digyneia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories or disturbed sites. It is also present in parts of India and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to warm, humid environments with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha digyneia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize ecological impact.</p>
