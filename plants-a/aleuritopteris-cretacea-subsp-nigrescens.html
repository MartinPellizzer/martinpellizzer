<p>Aleuritopteris cretacea subsp.</p>
<p>nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic gardens.</p>
