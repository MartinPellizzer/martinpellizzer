                <h1>Acronychia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Acronychia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable acronychia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which range from elliptic to ovate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its bark is smooth and often exhibits a pale to reddish color, and it is often found in coastal or near-coastal regions.</p>
<p>The species is known for its ecological importance in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia heterophylla has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming from September to November, and are likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its coastal habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia heterophylla is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland rainforests, as well as in wet and dry tropical forests. This species thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, known for its distinctive leaf shapes and small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Acronychia heterophylla plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia heterophylla was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in coastal and lowland regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high rainfall and is often found in tropical and subtropical areas. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its potential health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
