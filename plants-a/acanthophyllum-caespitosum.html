<p>Acanthophyllum caespitosum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations include deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum caespitosum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
