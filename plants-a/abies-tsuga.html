                        <h1>Abies tsuga</h1>
<p>Abies tsuga, commonly known as the hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pyramidal shape and dense foliage, with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies tsuga is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including parts of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. This species thrives in coniferous forests and is often associated with mixed evergreen woodlands. Its natural range extends from Alaska down to California and into the northern regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>Abies tsuga is also present in some parts of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas and eastern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies tsuga was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was brought for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and evergreen nature. The species has since become established in various regions, often thriving in moist, well-drained soils. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting local flora for resources.</p>
