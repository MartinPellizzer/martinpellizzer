                <h1>Acalypha fasciculata var. lyallii</h1>
<p>Acalypha fasciculata var. lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's spurflower, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features striking, vibrant red bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers, making it a visually appealing plant. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha fasciculata var. lyallii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with a pale yellow to greenish color, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp, dispersing its seeds by wind after the fruit splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha fasciculata var. lyallii is a variant of the narrow-leaved spurge, native to New Zealand, specifically found on the North and South Islands.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Australia and some regions of the United States. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural habitat makes it vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha fasciculata var. lyallii is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick and successful growth. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and blooming during the summer months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha fasciculata var. lyallii is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil along streambanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for native fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
