<p>Acetosa sterilis, commonly known as the sterile marsh cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acetosa sterilis is often found in disturbed or transitional habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
