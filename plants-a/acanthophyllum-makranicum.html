                    <h1>Acanthophyllum makranicum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum makranicum, commonly known as the Makran thorny shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its structure provides habitat for small animals and insects, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid areas.</p>
