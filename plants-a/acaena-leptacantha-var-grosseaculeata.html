The plant is notable for its large, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest margins and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
