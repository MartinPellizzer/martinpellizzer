                    <h1>Arctio lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Arctio lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly bear caterpillar, is a species of moth larva known for its distinctive fuzzy, grayish-brown appearance.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Erebidae and is characterized by its dense, soft hairs that cover its body. The plant it is associated with, however, is not a true plant but rather a larval stage of the insect. The woolly bear is often found feeding on various grasses and shrubs, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Its life cycle includes several stages, with the larval form being the most recognizable and widely studied.</p>
