<p>Asplenium × mixtum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. This plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × mixtum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions.</p>
