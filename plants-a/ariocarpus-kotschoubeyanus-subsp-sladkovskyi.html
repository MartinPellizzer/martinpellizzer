<p>Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp.</p>
<p>sladkovskyi, commonly known as the Sladkovsky's prickly pear, is a rare cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
