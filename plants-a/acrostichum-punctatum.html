                <h1>Acrostichum punctatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum punctatum, commonly known as the punctate fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive pattern of small, round dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with a unique appearance that makes it easily recognizable in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum punctatum has leathery, elongated leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure 30â€“50 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and upright, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a fibrous texture and grows in a creeping or clumping manner. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, with pale yellowish-green petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum punctatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamp forests, and along riverbanks where there is high humidity and abundant moisture. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Its distribution extends to parts of the Pacific Islands and northern Australia as well.</p>
<p>Acrostichum punctatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum punctatum was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, typically near coastal regions or in tropical environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or shaded areas. This plant is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread beyond controlled areas.</p>
