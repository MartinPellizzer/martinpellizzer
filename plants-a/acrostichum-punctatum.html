<p>Acrostichum punctatum, commonly known as the punctate fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive pattern of small, round dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with a unique appearance that makes it easily recognizable in its native habitat.</p>
