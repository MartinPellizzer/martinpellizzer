                    <h1>Abies miniata</h1>
<p>Abies miniata, commonly known as the miniature fir, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and short, needle-like leaves that are dark green with a silvery-blue underside. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, adding visual interest in the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and small landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, Abies miniata is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness.</p>
