<p>Acacia coolgardiensis subsp.</p>
<p>effusa, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, often twisted stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to low-nutrient, drought-prone areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
