                <h1>Acourtia souleana</h1>
<p>Acourtia souleana, commonly known as the Soulean's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It is a perennial herb that produces small, edible fruits, though it is not widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia souleana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a rough, hairy texture, typically displaying a light green to reddish-brown color. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia souleana is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in the central and southern regions of Mexico, including parts of the states such as Veracruz, Oaxaca, and Chiapas. It typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments, often in rocky or limestone soils. The plant is adapted to the warm, tropical climates of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia souleana was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. This species has since become naturalized in several regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife.</p>
