<p>Anathallis aquinoi, commonly known as the Aquino's spider orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that resemble spiders, a trait typical of the Anathallis genus. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with several tiny, delicate flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
