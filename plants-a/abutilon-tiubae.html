<p>Abutilon tiubae, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Abutilon tiubae prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon tiubae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 12 cm in length, usually with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically a reddish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are pendulous, with five petals forming a funnel shape, typically in shades of yellow or orange, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon tiubae is a flowering plant native to the eastern Andean regions of Peru, specifically in the departments of Cajamarca and Amazonas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is primarily confined to its native range, with limited cultivation outside of its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. This species grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Abutilon tiubae is considered to be of conservation concern, with its status likely being vulnerable or endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon tiubae is a fast-growing, ornamental plant known for its vibrant, maple-like leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer, and entering dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
