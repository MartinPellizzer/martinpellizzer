                <h1>Achyranthes axillaris</h1>
<p>Achyranthes axillaris, commonly known as the smallleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, often yellowish inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with simple, alternate leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in open areas such as fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it easily identifiable, though it is often mistaken for other spurge species due to its similar appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes axillaris has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branched, with a rough, brown bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes axillaris is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and woodland habitats, often growing along riverbanks and in disturbed soils. The plant thrives in warm climates with moderate to high rainfall, making it well adapted to the ecological conditions of its native range. It is also occasionally reported in parts of southern Asia, though its distribution there is less certain.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes axillaris was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities such as trade or accidental transport of contaminated materials. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and agricultural areas. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have led to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and control its spread in affected regions.</p>
