<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by vibrant, papery bracts.</p>
<p>Acalypha kotoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha kotoensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, waxy surface and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, varying in size from 5 to 12 centimeters in length. The stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale green to white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha kotoensis is a flowering plant native to the island of Koto, which is part of the Japanese Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed only in its native range, with no known introductions elsewhere. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically found in lowland forests and disturbed areas. It grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Acalypha kotoensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha kotoensis is a tropical shrub known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value, often grown as a houseplant or in warm climates.</p>
