                <h1>Adenia wightiana</h1>
<p>Adenia wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's Adenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features elliptical, dark green leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, clustered in umbels, and are often fragrant.</p>
<p>Adenia wightiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia wightiana has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to grey in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are actinomorphic, with five pink to reddish petals, and they bloom during the wet season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that disperses its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia wightiana is primarily native to India, Kenya, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Adenia wightiana is known for its distinctive leaf structure and flowering characteristics.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to diverse ecological conditions across these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia wightiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii and Tahiti.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading through seed dispersal by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
