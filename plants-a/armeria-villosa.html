                    <h1>Armeria villosa</h1>
<p>Armeria villosa, commonly known as seaside thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture and withstand salty sea air. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Armeria villosa is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
