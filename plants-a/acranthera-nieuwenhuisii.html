                <h1>Acranthera nieuwenhuisii</h1>
<p>Acranthera nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the Nieuwenhuis' acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family. This species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively rare and has specific ecological requirements, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera nieuwenhuisii has leaves that are linear to narrowly elliptic, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera nieuwenhuisii is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It thrives in the understory of dense vegetation, often near streams or in shaded environments. The plant is known for its small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera nieuwenhuisii was mainly introduced to South Africa, specifically in the Eastern Cape province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and shrubland habitats. The plant is often associated with sandy or well-drained soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>
