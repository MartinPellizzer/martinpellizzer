                <h1>Adnaria montana</h1>
<p>Adnaria montana, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salty sea air and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Adnaria montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh maritime environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria montana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria montana is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly on rocky shores and cliffs. This plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in shallow tidal zones. Its distribution extends to the eastern Mediterranean, such as the Levant and the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>It is also present in some parts of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria montana was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often colonizing tidal zones and estuaries. This plant is commonly found along the shores of countries such as Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like coastal development and the spread of ornamental plants.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and may impact local ecosystems.</p>
