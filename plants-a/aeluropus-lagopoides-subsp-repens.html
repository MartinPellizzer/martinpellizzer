<p>Aeluropus lagopoides subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow,坚韧 (resilient), and adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to prevent soil erosion in harsh environments.</p>
