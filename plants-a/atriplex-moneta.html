<p>Atriplex moneta, commonly known as silverleaf chenopody, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are edible and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Atriplex moneta is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
