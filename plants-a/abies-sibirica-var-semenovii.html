<p>Abies sibirica var. semenovii, commonly known as the Siberian fir, is a variant of the Siberian fir tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps the tree retain moisture in its cold, arid environment. Its cones are cylindrical and mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh climates and plays a significant role in the boreal forest ecosystems of its native range.</p>
