                <h1>Acer tschonoskii var. tschonoskii</h1>
<p>Acer tschonoskii var. tschonoskii, commonly known as the Tschonoskii maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii var. tschonoskii has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are inconspicuous, with small greenish-yellow blossoms that appear in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and oval-shaped.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its rocky or mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii var. tschonoskii is a species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution remains largely confined to its native range, with limited introduction elsewhere. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mixed forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited population size, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though its exact status may vary by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii var. tschonoskii is a hardy maple species commonly propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy.</p>
<p>It has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, making it suitable for long-term landscaping. This plant thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning is minimal, focusing on shaping and removing dead wood.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or ornamental grasses for aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii var. tschonoskii is a hardy tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii var. tschonoskii is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and carving. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat various ailments, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes, symbolizing resilience and beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in local ecosystems also contributes to biodiversity and soil stabilization in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
