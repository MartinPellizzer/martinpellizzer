<p>Agelaea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name.

The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
