                <h1>Acer obtusatum var. coriaceum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. coriaceum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and ovate leaves that are typically bright green on top and pale underneath. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. coriaceum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. coriaceum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now found in a few protected areas within its native habitat. This plant thrives in moist, temperate forests at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. coriaceum is a compact, slow-growing maple known for its unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years, and thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. coriaceum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its deep roots help in erosion control by stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. coriaceum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>However, its wood is valued in traditional crafts and small-scale woodworking for its durability and fine grain. In some regions, it has been used in folk medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is lacking. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local communities, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and ornamental than industrial or widespread.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. coriaceum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Orange Crown', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It also produces hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticulture. These varieties are valued for their unique leaf shapes and color changes, making them popular choices for gardens and landscapes. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of conditions, enhancing its appeal to gardeners.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer obtusatum var. coriaceum plays a significant role in the cultivation of decorative maples worldwide.</p>
