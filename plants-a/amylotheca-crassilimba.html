                    <h1>Amylotheca crassilimba</h1>
<p>Amylotheca crassilimba, commonly known as the thick-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish upper cortex with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant's thallus is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic structure. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Amylotheca crassilimba plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
