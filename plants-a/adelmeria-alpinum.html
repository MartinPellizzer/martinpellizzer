                <h1>Adelmeria alpinum</h1>
<p>Adelmeria alpinum, commonly known as the alpine adelmeria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth form. The plant features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. It produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adelmeria alpinum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats along the coast.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelmeria alpinum has needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals and a tubular shape, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky, alpine environments where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria alpinum is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the mountainous areas of Luzon and Mindanao. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in forested regions at higher elevations. Its distribution is limited to these particular habitats, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from threats such as deforestation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria alpinum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive evergreen foliage and showy white flowers.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
