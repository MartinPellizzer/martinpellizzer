<p>Astragalus corydalinus subsp.</p>
<p>prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically forms a dense mat of slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods. Its leaves are pinnately divided into numerous small, oval leaflets, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodland habitats.</p>
