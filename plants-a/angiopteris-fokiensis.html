                    <h1>Angiopteris fokiensis</h1>
<p>Angiopteris fokiensis, commonly known as the Fuzhou water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats.</p>
