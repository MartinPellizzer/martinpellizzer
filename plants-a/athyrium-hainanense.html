                    <h1>Athyrium hainanense</h1>
<p>Athyrium hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan shield fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
