<p>Ampelopsis hederacea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser ivy-leaved grapevine, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed, with a distinctive waxy coating on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
