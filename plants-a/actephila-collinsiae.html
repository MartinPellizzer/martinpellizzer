                <h1>Actephila collinsiae</h1>
<p>Actephila collinsiae, commonly known as Collins' actephila, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the wetland ecosystems it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila collinsiae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unbranched until the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila collinsiae is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in forested areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in undergrowth. The plant is known for its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila collinsiae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in the wild in the 1980s. The plant is believed to have been introduced through accidental transport via contaminated soil or plant material. It has since become established in several regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited and it is not considered a major invasive species.</p>
