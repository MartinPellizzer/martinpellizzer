                <h1>Aechmea lateralis</h1>
<p>Aechmea lateralis, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a silvery-gray coating, giving it its common name. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental species in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea lateralis has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and dark green with a waxy coating, arranged in a tight spiral around the central rosette.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem that is often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains compact and unbranched. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
