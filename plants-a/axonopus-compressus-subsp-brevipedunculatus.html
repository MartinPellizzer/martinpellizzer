<p>Axonopus compressus subsp.</p>
<p>brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed matgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth surface and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
