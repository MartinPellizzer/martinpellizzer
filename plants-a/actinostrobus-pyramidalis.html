                <h1>Actinostrobus pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Actinostrobus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base and female cones emerging from the upper part of the stem. Native to Australia, it thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostrobus pyramidalis has needle-like leaves that are slender, dark green, and arranged spirally along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a cone-like structure containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its coastal habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostrobus pyramidalis is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the state, particularly in the south and southwest. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal heath and dune ecosystems. It is an important component of the local flora and contributes to the biodiversity of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western parts of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostrobus pyramidalis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, cone-like appearance.</p>
<p>It was widely cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about biodiversity loss in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its population and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
