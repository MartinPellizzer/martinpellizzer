<p>Acetosa integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sorrel, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with smooth, undivided margins, which give it its specific epithet "integrifolia.". The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acetosa integrifolia contains oxalic acid, contributing to its tart flavor and potential medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosa integrifolia has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length, with smooth margins and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
