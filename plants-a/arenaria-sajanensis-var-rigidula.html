<p>Arenaria sajanensis var. rigidula, commonly known as the Sajan sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
