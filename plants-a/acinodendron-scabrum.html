                <h1>Acinodendron scabrum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron scabrum, commonly known as the rough acinodendron, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its rough, scaly bark and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Acinodendron scabrum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron scabrum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough, scaly texture and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, bushy habit. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron scabrum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is often associated with degraded or secondary vegetation. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acinodendron scabrum is also sometimes used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron scabrum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to withstand partial shade. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
