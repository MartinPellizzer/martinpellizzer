<p>Athyrium minutum, commonly known as the small fern or tiny wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>Athyrium minutum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat.</p>
