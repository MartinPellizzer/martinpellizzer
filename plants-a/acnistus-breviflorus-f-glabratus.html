                    <h1>Acnistus breviflorus f. glabratus</h1>
<p>Acnistus breviflorus f. glabratus, commonly known as the smoothflower acnistus, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the acnistus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced flowering and smoother foliage compared to the typical form. This plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its botanical features include small, clustered flowers and a low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
