                    <h1>Arabis lemmonii var. drepanoloba</h1>
<p>Arabis lemmonii var. drepanoloba, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which reduces water loss and protects against intense sunlight.</p>
