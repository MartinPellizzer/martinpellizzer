                    <h1>Aspidium conterminum var. pilosulum</h1>
<p>Aspidium conterminum var. pilosulum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
