<p>Abies guatemalensis subsp.</p>
<p>longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its conical shape, dense foliage, and distinctive bract-like structures on its cones.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in partial shade. Its needles are dark green and arranged in spirals, while the cones are pendulous and release seeds in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
