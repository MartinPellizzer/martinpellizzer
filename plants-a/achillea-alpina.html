                <h1>Achillea alpina</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with silver-gray, hairy leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale pink. The plant is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea alpina is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat wounds and digestive ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina has basal, linear to lanceolate leaves that are generally gray-green in color, with a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing from the rosette. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, including countries such as France, Italy, and the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa and the Middle East, though its range has been reduced in some areas. This plant thrives in alpine environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in open grasslands. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea alpina is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, although some populations may be threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers, often used in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, yarrow, or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina is a hardy plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and food for small animals and insects, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina is a flowering plant commonly found in alpine regions, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat digestive issues and as a mild sedative due to its compounds like flavonoids and essential oils. In some cultures, it holds symbolic meaning, often associated with healing and protection. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it can be incorporated into floral arrangements or teas in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also makes it valuable for soil stabilization and habitat support in mountainous areas.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea' with its golden foliage and 'Purpurea' known for its purple-tinged leaves, which add visual interest to gardens.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids that combine traits from related species like Achillea millefolium, resulting in plants with enhanced vigor and a broader range of flower colors. These varieties are valued for their hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders. Their long-lasting flowers and low maintenance requirements contribute to their horticultural importance.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea alpina and its cultivars are widely appreciated for their ornamental value and adaptability in diverse garden settings.</p>
