                <h1>Acosta soskae</h1>
<p>Acosta soskae, commonly known as the Soskae's acosta, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acosta soskae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta soskae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright, often branching near the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta soskae is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude environments, including cloud forests and mountainous areas. This species thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or forested terrain at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta soskae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on vehicles or gardening practices. It has since spread to surrounding areas, including parts of Washington and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is considered a potential invasive species in these regions.</p>
