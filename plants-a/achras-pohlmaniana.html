                <h1>Achras pohlmaniana</h1>
<p>Achras pohlmaniana, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a hard, woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras pohlmaniana has large, palm-like leaves that are compound, with elongated leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern, typically reaching up to 3 meters in length, and they are usually dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and short, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are grouped in clusters, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a woody, spiny capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pohlmaniana is a rare cycad-like plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>While its native range is restricted to Socotra, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections around the world. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found in rocky soils and coastal areas. This species grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Achras pohlmaniana is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras pohlmaniana is a striking, slow-growing tree known for its large, waxy leaves and striking fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by stem cuttings, with cuttings often yielding faster results. The plant has a long growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in warm, tropical climates.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract occasional scale insects or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants can enhance its growth and create a lush, vibrant garden space.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras pohlmaniana is a unique plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its large, fleshy fruits attract birds and small mammals, which help in seed dispersal. It acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in coastal or sandy environments.</p>
<p>The plant also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a diverse range of organisms.</p>
