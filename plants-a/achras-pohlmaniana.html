                <h1>Achras pohlmaniana</h1>
<p>Achras pohlmaniana, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a distinctive appearance. The bark is thick and corky, and the plant is known for its milky latex sap.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras pohlmaniana has large, palmate leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces showy yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the dry season, which are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiky capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pohlmaniana is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and rocky habitats of Socotra, where it thrives in dry, limestone-rich soils. This unique plant is endemic to the region, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. It is adapted to the extreme climate of the island, with a slow growth rate and specialized water conservation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pohlmaniana was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly in the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats due to its ability to thrive in sandy soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, especially for its large, waxy fruits. It has been reported in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region.</p>
