<p>White anemone, scientifically known as Anemone albana subsp. flavescens, is a delicate and elegant flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. This species is characterized by its pale white petals that gradually transition to a soft yellow at the edges, creating a striking visual contrast. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Due to its unique beauty and ecological importance, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions. Its presence in the wild highlights the importance of conserving fragile ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
