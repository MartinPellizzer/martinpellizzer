                <h1>Adenolinum pratense</h1>
<p>Adenolinum pratense, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Adenolinum pratense is typically found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum pratense has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from moist soil environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum pratense is primarily native to the temperate regions of Europe, particularly in the countries of France, Italy, and Germany.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soil and moderate sunlight. It is often associated with calcareous soils and can be found in both natural and semi-natural environments.</p>
<p>Adenolinum pratense plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum pratense was mainly introduced to North America during the late 20th century as part of ornamental plant introductions.</p>
<p>It has since established itself in moist, disturbed habitats across the eastern United States. The plant is commonly found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other areas with high soil moisture. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains a popular choice for wetland restoration projects.</p>
