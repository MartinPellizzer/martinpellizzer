                        <h1>Acer negundo f. lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Acer negundo f. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are narrower and longer than those of the typical boxelder. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
