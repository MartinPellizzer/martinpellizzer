<p>Archangelica oreadum, commonly known as the mountain angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and showy white or yellow flowers. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, containing compounds like volatile oils and alkaloids.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically used in culinary applications.</p>
