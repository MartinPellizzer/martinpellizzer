                <h1>Achillea tanacetifolia var. dentifera</h1>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. dentifera, commonly known as the toothed yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it a valued plant in both wildflower gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Achillea tanacetifolia var. dentifolia has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside; they are arranged alternately along the stem and are generally 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and herbaceous, with a slightly rough texture and a gray-green color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are small, composite yellow blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. dentifera is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly in regions of the Iberian Peninsula and parts of France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and naturalized areas in temperate regions worldwide. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, gravelly soils, and open woodlands. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is generally considered to be of conservation least concern due to its adaptability and widespread cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. dentifera is a hardy perennial plant known for its fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late winter. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2-3 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune back spent flower stems to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. dentifera is a hardy perennial that provides nectar and pollen for a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit acts as shelter for small insects and birds, offering protection from predators and harsh weather. It also serves as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic compounds. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
