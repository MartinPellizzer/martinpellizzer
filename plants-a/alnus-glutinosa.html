                <h1>Alnus glutinosa</h1>
<p>Alnus glutinosa, commonly known as sticky alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and its ability to thrive in wet or moist soils. The tree produces small, oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a sticky, resinous husk, which gives it its common name. It is often found in riparian zones and can play a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
