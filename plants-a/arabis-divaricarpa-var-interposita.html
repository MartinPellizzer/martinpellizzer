                    <h1>Arabis divaricarpa var. interposita</h1>
<p>Arabis divaricarpa var. interposita, commonly known as the variable rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it blooms before the summer heat sets in.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
