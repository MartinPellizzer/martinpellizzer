<p>Armeriastrum faustii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as small, gray-green leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in sandy and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Armeriastrum faustii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
