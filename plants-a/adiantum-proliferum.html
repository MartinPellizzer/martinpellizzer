<p>Adiantum proliferum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features feathery, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Adiantum proliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>
