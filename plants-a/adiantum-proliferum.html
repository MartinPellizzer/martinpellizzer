                <h1>Adiantum proliferum</h1>
<p>Adiantum proliferum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features feathery, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Adiantum proliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum proliferum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, slender, and can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a smooth, glossy surface. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, and it does not produce true flowers or seeds.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum proliferum is primarily native to Maluku.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the humid and tropical regions of this Indonesian archipelago. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Maluku, where the climate supports its growth.</p>
<p>Adiantum proliferum is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum proliferum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. This fern has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is likely due to both natural dispersal and human activities.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas and is not typically invasive.</p>
