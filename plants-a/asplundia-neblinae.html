                    <h1>Asplundia neblinae</h1>
<p>Asplundia neblinae, commonly known as the cloud forest ginger, is a rare orchid species native to the humid montane regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, typically growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Asplundia neblinae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
