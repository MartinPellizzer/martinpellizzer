<p>Anabasis eriopoda, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Anabasis eriopoda plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
