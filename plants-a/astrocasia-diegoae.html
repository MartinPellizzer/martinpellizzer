<p>Astrocasia diegoae, commonly known as Diego's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that bears a single, delicate white bloom with a subtle purple hue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Astrocasia diegoae is considered critically endangered.</p>
