<p>Aegilops hystrix, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Aegilops hystrix is also valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
