                <h1>Aegilops hystrix</h1>
<p>Aegilops hystrix, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Aegilops hystrix is also valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops hystrix has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 5 to 15 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous as the plant matures. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white florets, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a cylindrical spike that develops from the flower, containing small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and barbed structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
