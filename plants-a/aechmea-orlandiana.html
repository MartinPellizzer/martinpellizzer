                <h1>Aechmea orlandiana</h1>
<p>Aechmea orlandiana, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of trichomes, giving it a unique texture and appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea orlandiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea orlandiana has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, spiny, and dark green with a silvery underside, arranged in a compact cluster around the central stem.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows upward from the base of the plant. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of bright red flowers with white petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The plant produces a small, berry-like fruit that turns from green to red, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, as it is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees in humid environments.</p>
