                    <h1>Aechmea orlandiana</h1>
<p>Aechmea orlandiana, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of trichomes, giving it a unique texture and appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea orlandiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
