                    <h1>Angraecum vagans</h1>
<p>Angraecum vagans, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive central spur that contains nectar.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, Angraecum vagans is considered a conservation concern.</p>
