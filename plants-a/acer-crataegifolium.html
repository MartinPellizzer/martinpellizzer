                <h1>Acer crataegifolium</h1>
<p>Acer crataegifolium, commonly known as the flowering maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, showy flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length; they are dark green during the growing season and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching pattern that is relatively upright. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, with a simple structure consisting of four sepals and four petals; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a samara, a dry, winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China, specifically in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within evergreen forests, typically at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like scale insects or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem pollination. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of plant and animal life. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by contributing organic matter through leaf litter.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, sour-tasting fruits.</p>
<p>However, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Its wood, though not widely utilized commercially, can be used for small carpentry or as fuel. Culturally, it is sometimes symbolized in local folklore as a resilient plant that thrives in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and symbolic than industrial or economic.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame,' which are known for their striking fall color and unique foliage. Hybrids of Acer crataegifolium are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness, growth habit, and seasonal color display. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, especially in landscapes where vibrant autumn color is desired.</p>
<p>Their adaptability to various climates makes them important additions to both public and private gardens.</p>
