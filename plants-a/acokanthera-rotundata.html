                <h1>Acokanthera rotundata</h1>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata, commonly known as the African arrow poison.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it a source of traditional poison for arrow tips. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is handled with caution and is not widely cultivated.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata is primarily native to Eswatini, KwaZulu-Natal, Northern Provinces, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions in southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, as well as parts of KwaZulu-Natal. The plant thrives in coastal and semi-arid areas, often growing in open woodlands and along rocky outcrops. It is known for its toxic properties, which have made it a subject of both ecological and medical interest.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it has not spread extensively beyond its initial range.</p>
