                <h1>Acokanthera rotundata</h1>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata, commonly known as the African arrow poison or the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its dark, woody stems and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its most notable feature is the production of a potent cardiac glycoside called acokantherin, which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a dangerous plant and is not typically cultivated outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin strips, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, compact form. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and wasps. The fruit is a globose, yellowish capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with lateral branches, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from deep within the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata is a woody shrub native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Its current distribution remains largely within its native range, though it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research collections. It thrives in dry, rocky environments, often growing on cliffs or in arid shrublands. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Acokanthera rotundata is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata is a toxic shrub native to southern Africa, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sage can enhance its growth in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. It acts as a companion plant in certain agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of nearby crops. The plant also plays a role in soil stabilization, helping to prevent erosion in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports biodiversity by creating microhabitats that sustain a variety of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata is a plant native to southern Africa, known for its toxic properties and various traditional uses.</p>
<p>In some cultures, it has been used in rituals and as a symbol of power and protection. Its roots and leaves contain cardiac glycosides, which have been used in traditional medicine to treat heart conditions. However, due to its toxicity, it is not used in culinary or industrial applications.</p>
<p>The plant also plays a role in local economies through its use in traditional healing practices and as a source of materials for ceremonial purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rotundata has several varieties and cultivars that are cultivated for their ornamental value and unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegata' and 'Compacta', which are favored for their distinctive leaf patterns and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acokanthera rotundata are often created to enhance traits such as flower color, fragrance, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in various climates and their use in landscape design.</p>
<p>Their beauty and adaptability make them a valuable addition to gardens and botanical collections.</p>
