                <h1>Acianthera granitica</h1>
<p>Acianthera granitica, commonly known as the granite orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rocky highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often resembling those of other orchid genera. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Its unique adaptation to grow on granite surfaces makes it a specialized species with limited geographic distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Acianthera granitica is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera granitica has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows in a sprawling, low shrub form. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale purple color that blooms during the summer months, and they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera granitica is primarily native to Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills. This species thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs and slopes. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Venezuela's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acianthera granitica is an endemic orchid, highlighting the country's rich biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera granitica was mainly introduced to regions with rocky and quartz-rich soils, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high sunlight exposure and well-drained substrates, making it suitable for rocky outcrops and mountainous terrains. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats, such as areas affected by erosion or human activity. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in South America, where it has adapted to local environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, its spread remains limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
