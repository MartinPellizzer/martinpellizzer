                    <h1>Acianthera granitica</h1>
<p>Acianthera granitica, commonly known as the granite orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rocky highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often resembling those of other orchid genera. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Its unique adaptation to grow on granite surfaces makes it a specialized species with limited geographic distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Acianthera granitica is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
