<p>Acanthothamnus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless acanthothamnus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green, succulent stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its habitat.</p>
