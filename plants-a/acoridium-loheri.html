                    <h1>Acoridium loheri</h1>
<p>Acoridium loheri, commonly known as the Loher's arum, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and an unusual inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Acoridium loheri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
