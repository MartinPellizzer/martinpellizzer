                <h1>Acoridium loheri</h1>
<p>Acoridium loheri, commonly known as the Loher's arum, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and an unusual inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Acoridium loheri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium loheri has elongated, strap-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 30 cm in length with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a slight fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium loheri is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories where it thrives in humid environments. This plant is often associated with lowland and mountain rainforests, where it grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks and branches. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats, making it a relatively rare species in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Acoridium loheri is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium loheri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread to other tropical regions. Although it is not considered invasive, its distribution is limited to areas with suitable climate conditions. The plant is often found in gardens and along roadsides in these regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised awareness about the importance of monitoring non-native species in ecological contexts.</p>
