                <h1>Acinodendron notabile</h1>
<p>Acinodendron notabile, commonly known as the showy acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that consist of clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets, and it produces woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for its ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron notabile has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are moderate in size, typically measuring 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron notabile is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing along the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these tropical habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, the plant is becoming increasingly rare in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron notabile was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm climates. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
