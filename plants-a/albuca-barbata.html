                    <h1>Albuca barbata</h1>
<p>Albuca barbata, commonly known as the rock onion or desert onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear small, white or pale green flowers in the summer months. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valuable plant in certain culinary traditions.</p>
<p>Albuca barbata is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
