<p>Asplenium praegracile, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and spore-bearing structures called sorus. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Asplenium praegracile is often found in rocky crevices or on the bases of trees in temperate regions.</p>
