                    <h1>Anabasis aphylla</h1>
<p>Anabasis aphylla, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces yellow or green flowers that bloom in summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources.</p>
<p>Anabasis aphylla plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
