                    <h1>Asplenium rusciforme</h1>
<p>Asplenium rusciforme, commonly known as the clubmoss fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with tightly clustered, dark green, leathery leaves. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium rusciforme is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
