                <h1>Adina lasiantha</h1>
<p>Adina lasiantha, commonly known as the white adina, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Adina lasiantha make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina lasiantha has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina lasiantha is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. The plant thrives in shaded understory environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to regions with warm, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina lasiantha was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. It spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and environmental changes.</p>
