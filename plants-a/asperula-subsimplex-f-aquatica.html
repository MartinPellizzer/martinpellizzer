<p>Asperula subsimplex f. aquatica, commonly known as water asperula, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, glossy leaves that are typically rounded or ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid environments.</p>
