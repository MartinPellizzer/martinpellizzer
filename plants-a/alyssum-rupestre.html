                    <h1>Alyssum rupestre</h1>
<p>Alyssum rupestre, commonly known as rock allyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Alyssum rupestre is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
