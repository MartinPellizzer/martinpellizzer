                <h1>Acioa johnstonei</h1>
<p>Acioa johnstonei, commonly known as the Johnstone's acioa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high sunlight exposure. Acioa johnstonei is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa johnstonei has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa johnstonei is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is commonly found in the Amazon basin. This plant is often associated with moist, shaded environments within the understory of dense tropical rainforests. Acioa johnstonei is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa johnstonei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites. It is now considered a potential weed in certain regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited but expanding due to its ability to thrive in various soil types.</p>
