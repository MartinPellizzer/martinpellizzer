<p>Aspidium aculeatum var. nigropaleaceum, commonly known as the black-pale fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing erect, branched fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, glossy appearance on the upper surface and a darker, almost black, underside. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the pinnae.</p>
<p>This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
