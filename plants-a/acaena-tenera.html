                        <h1>Acaena tenera</h1>
<p>Acaena tenera, commonly known as New Zealand burr or mountain burr, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and persistent, bristly foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Acaena tenera thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>
