                    <h1>Agrostis exarata var. mutica</h1>
<p>Agrostis exarata var. mutica, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of fine hairs, which give it its common name. It is typically found in open areas such as meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Silky bentgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixtures for its drought tolerance and fine texture.</p>
