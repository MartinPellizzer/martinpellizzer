                <h1>Achyropsis alba</h1>
<p>Achyropsis alba, commonly known as the white sand plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, Achyropsis alba is of interest to botanists and succulent enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropsis alba has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are simple, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis alba is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. This plant thrives in areas with limited soil and high sunlight exposure, typical of its native habitat. It is also present in some parts of Turkey and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to regions with a climate similar to its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis alba was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can establish itself easily. This plant has been reported in several countries across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
