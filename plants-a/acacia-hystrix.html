                        <h1>Acacia hystrix</h1>
<p>Acacia hystrix, commonly known as the needle acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flower clusters that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Acacia hystrix is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia hystrix belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their acicular leaves and often producing pods with seeds.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia hystrix, a specific type of acacia known for its unique features and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hystrix is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandy soils of the southern and western parts of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and woodland areas. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Acacia hystrix plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hystrix was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and habitat for wildlife. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also cultivated in other parts of the world with similar environmental conditions.</p>
