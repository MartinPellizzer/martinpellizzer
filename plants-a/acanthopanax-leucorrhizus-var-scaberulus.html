                <h1>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus var. scaberulus</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus var. scaberulus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed five-finger plant, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with five leaflets. The plant produces small, white flowers in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its root system is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus var. scaberulus has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color, growing upright with a branched structure. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal consumption and excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus var. scaberulus is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, where it has been introduced in some regions. It thrives in temperate to subtropical environments, often growing in forest understories or on rocky slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a species of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus var. scaberulus is a hardy, woody shrub commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun, requiring regular watering during dry periods but being sensitive to waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning in late winter encourages bushier foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus var. scaberulus is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its deep root system also aids in nutrient cycling and improves soil structure.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and supporting healthy forest habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus var. scaberulus is a lesser-known plant with limited but notable uses.</p>
