                    <h1>Azolla pinnata var. imbricata</h1>
<p>Azolla pinnata var. imbricata, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in a dense mat of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and rice fields. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective bioindicator of nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a distinctive overlapping arrangement that gives it its common name.</p>
