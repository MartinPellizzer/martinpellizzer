                    <h1>Arenaria cherleriae</h1>
<p>Arenaria cherleriae, commonly known as the Kashmir snowflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has a compact rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in mountain ecosystems.</p>
