                <h1>Acourtia collina</h1>
<p>Acourtia collina, commonly known as the sticky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows in dry, sandy soils, often in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia collina has small, oblanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia collina is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in coastal and inland areas, primarily in the northern part of California and southern Oregon. This species thrives in coastal sage scrub and chaparral environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Acourtia collina typically grows at elevations between 0 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution, making it vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acourtia collina is a hardy perennial plant native to the western United States, known for its resilience and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots, with the latter method offering quicker results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during its growing season, but it should be allowed to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in late winter encourages new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acourtia collina is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Additionally, Acourtia collina helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and promoting a balanced environment for other plant species.</p>
