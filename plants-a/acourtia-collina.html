                <h1>Acourtia collina</h1>
<p>Acourtia collina, commonly known as the slender acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acourtia collina is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to coastal climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia collina has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and somewhat woody, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia collina is primarily native to coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, often in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates. This plant thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is adapted to the coastal conditions of its native range. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>
<p>Acourtia collina is typically found in habitats such as dunes, scrublands, and coastal grasslands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia collina was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and has become naturalized in some regions. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as coastal development and landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species that may impact local ecosystems.</p>
