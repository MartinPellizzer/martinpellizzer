                <h1>Adiantum excisum</h1>
<p>Adiantum excisum, commonly known as the cut fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a finely cut appearance, giving it a lacy texture.</p>
<p>Adiantum excisum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum excisum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a slender and upright growth habit, reaching up to 30 cm in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with a structure consisting of separate stamens and pistils, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it anchor to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum excisum is primarily native to Chile Central.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the temperate regions of this area. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. It is a member of the fern family and is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to the central part of Chile, where it grows in specific microhabitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum excisum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
