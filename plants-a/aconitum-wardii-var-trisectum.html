                    <h1>Aconitum wardii var. trisectum</h1>
<p>Aconitum wardii var. trisectum, commonly known as the three-lobed aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy, violet-blue to purple flowers. The leaves are palmately lobed, with three to five distinct divisions, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
