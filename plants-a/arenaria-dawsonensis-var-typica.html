                    <h1>Arenaria dawsonensis var. typica</h1>
<p>Arenaria dawsonensis var. typica, commonly known as Dawson's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas.</p>
