<p>Arenaria kotschyi, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria kotschyi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
