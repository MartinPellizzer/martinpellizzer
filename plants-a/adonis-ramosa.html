                <h1>Adonis ramosa</h1>
<p>Adonis ramosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adonis ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, early spring blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis ramosa has compound, trifoliate leaves that are oval to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, branching, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a reddish-brown color and a somewhat woody texture as it matures. Its flowers are yellow, radially symmetrical, and consist of five petals, blooming in early spring and attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ramosa is primarily native to China North-Central, Japan, and the Kuril Is.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. It thrives in areas with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. Adonis ramosa is often associated with open landscapes such as meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions, reflecting its adaptation to high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ramosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
