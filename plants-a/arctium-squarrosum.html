<p>Arctium squarrosum, commonly known as the hispid hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a spiny, burr-like structure that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>Arctium squarrosum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
