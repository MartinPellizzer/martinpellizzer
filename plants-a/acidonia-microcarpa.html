                <h1>Acidonia microcarpa</h1>
<p>Acidonia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf wax tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and waxy, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a foundation plant in landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidonia microcarpa has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidonia microcarpa is primarily native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity of the region's tropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidonia microcarpa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many non-native environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
