<p>Acmispon grandiflorus var. macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered burr medic, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical, globular heads, which are often referred to as "burr" due to their rough, bristly texture. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
