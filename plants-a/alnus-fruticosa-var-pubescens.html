<p>Alnus fruticosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent alder, is a shrub native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment in disturbed areas.</p>
