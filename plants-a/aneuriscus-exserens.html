<p>Aneuriscus exserens, commonly known as the desert rose or the rock rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and typically shed during periods of drought.</p>
<p>Aneuriscus exserens is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
