<p>Ampelocera hottlei, commonly known as the hotte's ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to store water in its leaves, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
