                        <h1>Acer negundo var. laciniatum</h1>
<p>Acer negundo var. laciniatum, commonly known as the fragrant maple, is a variant of the box elder tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it is relatively short-lived.</p>
