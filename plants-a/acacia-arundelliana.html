                        <h1>Acacia arundelliana</h1>
<p>Acacia arundelliana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and bipinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acacia arundelliana is also valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping in regions with similar climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia arundelliana is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high temperatures.</p>
<p>Acacia arundelliana is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia arundelliana was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the country. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can spread aggressively. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value.</p>
