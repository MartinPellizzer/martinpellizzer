                <h1>Actinodaphne macroptera</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaf sandalwood, is a member of the樟科 ( Lauraceae ) family.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate, and elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a fragrant scent, and it produces small, round drupes as fruits.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macroptera has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a straight growth pattern and a slightly rough texture when mature. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, blooming during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth drupe that disperses through wind and animals after ripening to a red color.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macroptera is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Malay Archipelago and the Philippines, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as data deficient, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macroptera is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to humid environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant exhibits a slow to moderate growth cycle, often reaching maturity within several years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while diseases like leaf spot can occur if humidity levels are too high.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a tropical garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macroptera is a vital component of tropical ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecological balance. The plant also acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native species to promote a healthy microclimate. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing land degradation.</p>
<p>Overall, Actinodaphne macroptera contributes significantly to the ecological health of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
