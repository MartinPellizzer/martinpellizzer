                    <h1>Agropyron acutum var. subrepens</h1>
<p>Agropyron acutum var. subrepens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high altitudes, and is often used in restoration ecology due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for soil stabilization and ecological resilience.</p>
