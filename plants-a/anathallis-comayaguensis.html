                    <h1>Anathallis comayaguensis</h1>
<p>Anathallis comayaguensis, commonly known as the Comayagua mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and typically attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Anathallis comayaguensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its environment by influencing host tree health and providing resources for various insect pollinators.</p>
