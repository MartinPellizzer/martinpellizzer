                <h1>Adoxa moschatellina</h1>
<p>Adoxa moschatellina, commonly known as the sweet flag or muskroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, aromatic stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adoxa moschatellina has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and somewhat woody, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa moschatellina is primarily native to a vast and diverse range spanning from Alaska, Albania, Alberta, Altay, Amur, Austria, Baltic States, Belarus, Belgium, British Columbia, Bulgaria, Buryatiya, Central European Russia, China North-Central, China South-Central, Chita, Colorado, Corse, Czechia-Slovakia, Denmark, East European Russia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Illinois, Inner Mongolia, Iowa, Ireland, Irkutsk, Italy, Japan, Kamchatka, Kazakhstan, Khabarovsk, Kirgizstan, Korea, Krasnoyarsk, Kuril Is., Magadan, Manchuria, Manitoba, Minnesota, Mongolia, Montana, Morocco, Nepal, Netherlands, New Mexico, New York, North Caucasus, North European Russia, Northwest European Russia, Northwest Territories, Norway, NW.</p>

This widespread distribution indicates its adaptability to a variety of climates and habitats across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant's presence in both temperate and subarctic regions highlights its ecological versatility.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects a complex interplay of geographic and climatic factors that have shaped its historical and current distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa moschatellina was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant has spread across various regions, including parts of the eastern and western United States. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread presence, it is not considered a major threat to native plant communities in most areas.</p>
