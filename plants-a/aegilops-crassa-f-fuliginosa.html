                    <h1>Aegilops crassa f. fuliginosa</h1>
<p>Aegilops crassa f. fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty aegilops, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage due to the presence of a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique pigmentation and potential adaptations to arid environments.</p>
