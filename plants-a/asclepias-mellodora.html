<p>Asclepias mellodora, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain toxic, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to some animals.</p>
<p>Asclepias mellodora plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
