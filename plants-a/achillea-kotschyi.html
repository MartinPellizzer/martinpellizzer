                <h1>Achillea kotschyi</h1>
<p>Achillea kotschyi, commonly known as the Armenian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its foliage is aromatic and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in early summer, range in color from white to pale yellow, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea kotschyi has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and somewhat woody with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea kotschyi is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly found in parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes arid and semi-arid areas within these regions, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It thrives in environments with limited rainfall and high solar exposure, typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Achillea kotschyi is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea kotschyi is a hardy perennial known for its showy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, often cultivated in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant has a summer growing cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during dry periods, but overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
