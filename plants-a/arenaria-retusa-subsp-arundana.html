<p>Arenaria retusa subsp.</p>
<p>arundana, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh environments make it a characteristic species of tundra and mountain habitats.</p>
