                <h1>Achyrocalyx pungens</h1>
<p>Achyrocalyx pungens, commonly known as the spiny achyrocalyx, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyx. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and branched.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx pungens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx pungens is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant typically grows in dense undergrowth and is often associated with secondary vegetation. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes moist forests and riverine environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx pungens was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields, where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a potential threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and manage its impact on native flora.</p>
