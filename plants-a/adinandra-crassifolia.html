                <h1>Adinandra crassifolia</h1>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia is typically found in lowland forests and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops vertical ridges as the plant matures. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring four petals and stamens, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Southeast Asian region. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically growing in the understorey of primary forests. Its distribution is largely restricted to the island of Borneo, with no known presence on other nearby islands.</p>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia is an important component of the local flora and contributes to the biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated in ornamental gardens due to its attractive foliage and resilience. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and local competition with native flora.</p>
