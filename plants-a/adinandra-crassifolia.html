<p>Adinandra crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved adinandra, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Theaceae, which includes camellias and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests.</p>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. It thrives in tropical lowland rainforests, often growing in shaded understory conditions. Adinandra crassifolia typically occurs at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as data deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra crassifolia is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ferns can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
