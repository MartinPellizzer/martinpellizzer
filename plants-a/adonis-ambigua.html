                <h1>Adonis ambigua</h1>
<p>Adonis ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with five petals and numerous stamens. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Adonis ambigua is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for various ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis ambigua has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals arranged in a cup-like structure, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ambigua is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean, including parts of Turkey, Greece, and the southern Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This plant is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in open meadows and along cliff faces. It is adapted to the harsh climate of these regions, with its flowering period typically occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ambigua was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil conditions. This plant has been documented in several states across the United States, including California, Oregon, and Washington. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can sometimes outcompete native species in invaded areas.</p>
