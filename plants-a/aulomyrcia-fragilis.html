                    <h1>Aulomyrcia fragilis</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia fragilis, commonly known as the fragile aulomyrcia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Aulomyrcia fragilis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
