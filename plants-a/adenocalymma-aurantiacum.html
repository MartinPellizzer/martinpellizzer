Its leaves are alternate and lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma aurantiacum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma aurantiacum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbranched until it reaches maturity.
