<p>Angraecum bicaudatum, commonly known as the two-tailed orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear fragrant, white or pale green flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and floral structure make it a subject of botanical interest.</p>
<p>Angraecum bicaudatum is also notable for its ability to flower at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal moths.</p>
