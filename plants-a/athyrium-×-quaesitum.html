                    <h1>Athyrium × quaesitum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × quaesitum, commonly known as the hybrid lady fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. The plant produces fertile spores but does not form viable seeds, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a striking addition to rock gardens and shady borders.</p>
