                    <h1>Amentotaxus poilanei</h1>
<p>Amentotaxus poilanei, commonly known as the Pouilane's yew, is a rare and endangered coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Taxaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including scale-like leaves and woody cones. The plant is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several decades in age. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various endemic species and its contribution to the biodiversity of its native forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
