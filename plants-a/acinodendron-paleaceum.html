                <h1>Acinodendron paleaceum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron paleaceum, commonly known as the white-flowered acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often giving it a delicate appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Acinodendron paleaceum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron paleaceum has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, almost white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow, with four petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron paleaceum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, lowland forests and is often associated with secondary growth areas. Its distribution is closely linked to the Amazon and Atlantic Forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron paleaceum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering capabilities. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
