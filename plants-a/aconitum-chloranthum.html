                <h1>Aconitum chloranthum</h1>
<p>Aconitum chloranthum, commonly known as the green-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that are surrounded by two large, petal-like bracts. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Aconitum chloranthum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum chloranthum has palmate leaves that are deeply divided, with a bright green color and a rough texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes ridged as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five sepals and petals, and they bloom in late summer, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum chloranthum is primarily native to China South-Central and the East Himalaya.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions characterized by high altitudes and temperate climates. It typically grows in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Tibet, Sichuan, and neighboring regions in the Himalayas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum chloranthum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was primarily spread as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. The plant has since naturalized in several regions, particularly in moist, shaded areas of forests and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered a major threat to native plant communities in most areas.</p>
