                        <h1>Acacia nilotica subsp. kraussiana</h1>
<p>Acacia nilotica subsp.</p>
<p>kraussiana, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and charcoal.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nilotica subsp.</p>
<p>kraussiana is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. It is also found in parts of Sudan and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in savannas and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is commonly used for its timber, fodder, and in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nilotica subsp.</p>
<p>kraussiana was mainly introduced to regions with semi-arid to arid climates, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is commonly found in savannas, shrublands, and along riverbanks where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used for its hardy nature, providing shade and timber in human settlements and agricultural areas. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native species in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, it requires careful management to prevent overgrowth and maintain ecological balance.</p>
