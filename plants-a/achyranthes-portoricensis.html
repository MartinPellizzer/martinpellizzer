                <h1>Achyranthes portoricensis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Achyranthes portoricensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes portoricensis has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and slender, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread shallowly through the soil, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes portoricensis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils throughout the island. This species thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the Greater Antilles, with Puerto Rico being its main habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes portoricensis was mainly introduced to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is a native plant of the Caribbean region and has been established in various habitats across the island. The distribution of this species is primarily confined to coastal areas and disturbed sites. It is commonly found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to different parts of Puerto Rico, though its range remains limited compared to other invasive species.</p>
