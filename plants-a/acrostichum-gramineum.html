                    <h1>Acrostichum gramineum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum gramineum, commonly known as the common brake, is a perennial fern native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces erect, spore-bearing fronds that are typically 1 to 2 meters tall, with a lanceolate shape and a serrated edge. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
