                <h1>Acrostichum gramineum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum gramineum, commonly known as the common brake, is a perennial fern native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces erect, spore-bearing fronds that are typically 1 to 2 meters tall, with a lanceolate shape and a serrated edge. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gramineum has long, narrow, blade-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, feather-like pattern, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a fibrous texture and a light green to brownish color, growing in dense clumps. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, arranged in spadices, and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gramineum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and other moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is also present in some regions of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to parts of southern Florida and the southeastern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gramineum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, shaded environments and is commonly found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in several countries, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, it remains an important plant in local ecosystems and cultural practices.</p>
