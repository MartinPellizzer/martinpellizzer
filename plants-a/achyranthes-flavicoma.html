                <h1>Achyranthes flavicoma</h1>
<p>Achyranthes flavicoma, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas, though it has limited economic importance compared to other members of its family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes flavicoma has compound leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a spreading or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a greenish-yellow color, and bloom during the summer months; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes flavicoma is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant thrives in open habitats such as forests, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is often seen growing in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes flavicoma was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where it can establish itself in open, sunny habitats. This plant is commonly found in roadsides, waste areas, and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>It can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances in the areas where it is introduced.</p>
