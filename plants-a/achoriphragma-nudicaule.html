                <h1>Achoriphragma nudicaule</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma nudicaule is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma nudicaule has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are generally light green in color and vary in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma nudicaule is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and open grasslands. It is adapted to the mild, moist climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma nudicaule is an important component of the local flora in these coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma nudicaule was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the western states.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in California, Nevada, and Oregon, where it spreads quickly in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as transportation and land development.</p>
