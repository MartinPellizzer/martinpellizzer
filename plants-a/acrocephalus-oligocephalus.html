                    <h1>Acrocephalus oligocephalus</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus oligocephalus, commonly known as the short-headed reed-warbler, is a small passerine bird native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sylviidae and is characterized by its slender body and distinctive plumage. The species is typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes and reed beds, where it forages for insects. Its breeding season involves complex vocalizations and nest-building behaviors.</p>
<p>The plant name may be a misnomer, as the species is an avian rather than a botanical entity.</p>
