<p>Angraecopsis comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces pale yellow or white petals with a distinctive star-shaped pattern, which is a key feature in its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
