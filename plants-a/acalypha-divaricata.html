                <h1>Acalypha divaricata</h1>
<p>Acalypha divaricata, commonly known as the red-veined strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with distinctive red veins that contrast with its green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and prefers moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Acalypha divaricata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf patterns and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha divaricata has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, semi-woody, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes slightly rough with age. Its small, clustered flowers are unisexual, with yellow staminate flowers and greenish pistillate flowers, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha divaricata is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in East Africa, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks, often in shaded environments. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, habitat loss due to deforestation poses a potential threat to its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha divaricata is a decorative shrub known for its vibrant foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick establishment. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, especially during its active growth cycle in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer every few months, and prune it to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
