                    <h1>Australina procumbens</h1>
<p>Australina procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate australina, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground, adapting well to arid and coastal environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Australina procumbens is often used in native landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
