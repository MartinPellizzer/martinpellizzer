                <h1>Aconitum rostratum</h1>
<p>Aconitum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features showy, hooded blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has palmately lobed, dark green leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland settings.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum rostratum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a rough texture and a width of up to 20 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to violet, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rostratum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is commonly associated with mountain meadows and slopes where the climate is cool and moist. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rostratum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread into natural areas, often along streambanks and moist woodlands where it thrives in shaded, moist conditions. This distribution is largely the result of its adaptability to disturbed soils and its ability to colonize new areas rapidly. Its presence has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Aconitum rostratum is considered invasive in many regions, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
