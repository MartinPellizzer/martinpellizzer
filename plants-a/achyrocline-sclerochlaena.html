                <h1>Achyrocline sclerochlaena</h1>
<p>Achyrocline sclerochlaena, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by native insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinctive scent, contributing to its ecological significance in the region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline sclerochlaena has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and have a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, with a white to pale blue color, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are tiny and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline sclerochlaena is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry to moist forests and open areas within its native range. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is sometimes considered a rare or endemic species in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline sclerochlaena was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various habitats, including coastal dunes and open woodlands. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities contribute to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it poses a threat to the ecological balance of the region.</p>
