                <h1>Adiantum pacotti</h1>
<p>Adiantum pacotti, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are bi-lobed and often have a distinctive, curling appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum pacotti is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pacotti has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure around 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem that is covered in a thin, smooth bark and grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a globose capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and rhizoidal, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pacotti is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Amapá. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments within the Amazon rainforest. It is often seen growing on rock surfaces or in moist, forested areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the unique ecological conditions of the Amazon basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pacotti was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>The introduction of Adiantum pacotti has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
