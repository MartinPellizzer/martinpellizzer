                    <h1>Agrostis dubia</h1>
<p>Agrostis dubia, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Agrostis dubia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
