<p>Asplenium triste, commonly known as the sad fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually a dark green color. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium triste is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions.</p>
