                <h1>Acer lobulatum var. barbinerve</h1>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. barbinerve, commonly known as the barbed-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with lobes that are often slightly notched or toothed. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It is relatively slow-growing and has moderate drought tolerance, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. barbinerve has palmately lobed leaves that are typically ovate to cordate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure with separate sepals and petals. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the light, feathery structure of the seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. barbinerve is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Although its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the high-altitude forests of this region. It thrives in moist, temperate climates with well-drained soils, typically found in mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. This species grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. barbinerve is a striking ornamental maple known for its unique lobed leaves and vibrant seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal traits. The growth cycle involves rapid spring growth followed by a period of dormancy in winter, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with moderate watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage airflow. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. barbinerve is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. barbinerve is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>However, it has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Its wood, though not widely used industrially, can be crafted into small decorative items or tools. In some regions, it holds cultural significance as a symbol of resilience and adaptability in local folklore.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more symbolic and traditional than commercial, making it an important plant in ecological and cultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. barbinerve has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Crown' and 'Orange Crown,' which display striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is also used in hybridization to create new maple species with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. Its hybrids often combine the aesthetic appeal of barbinerve with the hardiness of other maple species. Horticulturally, it is important for its ornamental use in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Due to its distinctive features, it remains a sought-after plant in the horticultural trade.</p>
