<p>Acer hayatae var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a rare and unique variant of the Hayata maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and distinctive foliage that turns vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Native to the mountainous regions of Japan, this species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a doubly serrated base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a valuable addition to botanical collections and gardens.</p>
