<p>Asplenium warneckei, commonly known as the Warneck's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typically in pairs along the veins.</p>
<p>Asplenium warneckei is a relatively uncommon species, often found in specific microhabitats across tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
