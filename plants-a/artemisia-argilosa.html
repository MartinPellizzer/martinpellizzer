                    <h1>Artemisia argilosa</h1>
<p>Artemisia argilosa, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, sandy, or clay soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
