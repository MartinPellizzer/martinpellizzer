                    <h1>Armeria pungens</h1>
<p>Armeria pungens, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in coastal landscaping and as a ground cover.</p>
