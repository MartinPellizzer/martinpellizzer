<p>Acrolophia lamellata, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Acrolophia lamellata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophia lamellata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth texture.

The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophia lamellata is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive in low-water conditions.</p>
<p>Acrolophia lamellata is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophia lamellata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is particularly prevalent in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in irrigation channels. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging invasive species to control.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties.</p>
