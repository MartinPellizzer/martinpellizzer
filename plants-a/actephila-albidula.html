<p>Actephila albidula, commonly known as the white-flowered actephila, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Actephila albidula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila albidula has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy texture and a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparsely. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring five petals and stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila albidula is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous areas. It is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its small, white flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Vietnam, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila albidula was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with poor soil and full sun exposure. This plant is often found along the edges of forests and in dry, open landscapes. Its introduction has led to its spread in regions with similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
