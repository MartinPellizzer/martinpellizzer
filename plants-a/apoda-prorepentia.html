                    <h1>Apoda-prorepentia</h1>
<p>Apoda-prorepentia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no visible leaves, relying instead on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are pale green or white, often resembling a ghostly presence in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is classified as endangered.</p>
