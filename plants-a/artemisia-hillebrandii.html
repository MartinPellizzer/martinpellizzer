<p>Artemisia hillebrandii, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Artemisia hillebrandii is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
