<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptic with smooth margins, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia.</p>
<p>Acalypha tacanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha tacanensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slight pubescent texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and a yellowish stamen, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption during dry periods.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha tacanensis is a flowering plant native to Central America, specifically found in parts of Guatemala and Honduras.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas in Mexico, Belize, and El Salvador, where it has been introduced. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas near rivers or in dense forests. This species is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha tacanensis is a tropical shrub known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value, often cultivated as a houseplant or in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, especially in optimal conditions, and thrives in bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract spider mites or aphids, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like mint or basil can help repel pests and enhance the plant's growth.</p>
