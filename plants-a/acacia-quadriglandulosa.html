                        <h1>Acacia quadriglandulosa</h1>
<p>Acacia quadriglandulosa, commonly known as the four-gland acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with four glands on each leaflet, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, typically during the warmer months. Its bark is smooth and often fissured, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia quadriglandulosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia quadriglandulosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia quadriglandulosa is also sometimes used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia quadriglandulosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in semi-arid conditions and its tolerance to poor soils. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fodder.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation.</p>
