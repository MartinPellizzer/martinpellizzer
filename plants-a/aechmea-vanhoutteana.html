<p>Aechmea vanhoutteana, commonly known as the Vanhoutte's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of long, spiky leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces vibrant, flower-like structures known as inflorescences, which can be red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea vanhoutteana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
