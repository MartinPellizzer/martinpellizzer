                <h1>Acer oblongum var. trilobum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a maple leaf but with three distinct lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming furrowed with age.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal foliage and structural beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. trilobum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a truncate or slightly notched base, and a serrated margin; they are arranged alternately along the stem, measure up to 10 cm in length, and display a vibrant green on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a pyramidal form when young, becoming more spreading with maturity. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in catkins, appearing in early spring; they are wind-pollinated and lack showy petals. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils and facilitating nutrient uptake.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. trilobum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in parts of Virginia and North Carolina.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in mixed hardwood forests, often near streams or in coves. This species is typically found at elevations between 300 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and declining population, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. trilobum is a slow-growing deciduous tree known for its unique trilobed leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree has a temperate growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer with a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and consistent watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. trilobum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it effective in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. trilobum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits, though its sap can be tapped for syrup in certain contexts.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, though scientific validation remains limited. The wood of this species is not widely used industrially due to its softness and scarcity, but it may have niche applications in small-scale woodworking. Culturally, it is not as symbolically significant as other maple species, but it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological systems.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more common maple varieties.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. trilobum has several popular cultivars, such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', which are prized for their striking fall color and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to varieties like 'Autumn Flame' and 'Emerald Queen' that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often display more vibrant colors and improved hardiness, making them popular choices for landscaping. The horticultural importance of Acer oblongum var. trilobum lies in its adaptability to various climates and its ability to add visual interest to gardens throughout the year.</p>
<p>Its diverse varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the maple family's appeal in both public and private landscapes.</p>
