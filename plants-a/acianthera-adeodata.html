                <h1>Acianthera adeodata</h1>
<p>Acianthera adeodata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>The flowers are fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera adeodata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with three petals and a spurred lip, blooming in late winter to early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera adeodata is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Antioquia, Cauca, and Nari√±o. This orchid thrives in humid, montane forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. It is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The species is known for its delicate flowers and is considered a rare and endemic orchid in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera adeodata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. However, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate.</p>
