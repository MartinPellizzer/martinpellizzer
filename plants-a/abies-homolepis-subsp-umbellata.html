                        <h1>Abies homolepis subsp. umbellata</h1>
<p>Abies homolepis subsp.</p>
<p>umbellata, commonly known as the Japanese fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typically found in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The subspecies umbellata is distinguished by its unique cone structure, which is more clustered compared to other subspecies of Abies homolepis.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Abies homolephis subsp.</p>
<p>umbellata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It grows in high-altitude forests at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and thrives in temperate mountain environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies homolepis subsp.</p>
<p>umbellata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it suitable for temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often planted for its ornamental value due to its attractive conical shape and dense foliage. It has been introduced to parts of North America, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental tree.</p>
<p>However, its natural range is primarily limited to East Asia, where it grows in native forest habitats.</p>
