                    <h1>Alchemilla impedicellata</h1>
<p>Alchemilla impedicellata, commonly known as the rock alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Alchemilla impedicellata is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
