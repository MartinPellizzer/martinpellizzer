                        <h1>Abies pinsapo subsp. hispanica</h1>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in southern Spain. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The cones are typically small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>hispanica is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically southern Spain. It is found in the Sierra de Cazorla, Sierra de Los Filabres, and other mountain ranges in Andalusia.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It grows in rocky soils and is often found in mixed forests with other coniferous species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in southern Spain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>hispanica was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in southern Europe. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife. It has been introduced to parts of Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
