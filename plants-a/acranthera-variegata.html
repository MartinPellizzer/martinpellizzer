                <h1>Acranthera variegata</h1>
<p>Acranthera variegata, commonly known as the variegated acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens across the Mediterranean and other temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera variegata has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera variegata is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Malay Archipelago. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically in the undergrowth of dense forest areas. It is known for its distinctive variegated leaves and is often associated with specific microhabitats within the forest ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera variegata was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape Province.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. The distribution of this species is primarily confined to the coastal and mountainous regions of the region. It has not become naturalized in the wild and is mostly found in cultivation.</p>
<p>Its presence in the area is relatively limited and restricted to specific habitats.</p>
