                    <h1>Athyrium × yakuinsulare</h1>
<p>Athyrium × yakuinsulare, commonly known as the Yaku Island shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium yakuense.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings.</p>
