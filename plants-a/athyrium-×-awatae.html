                    <h1>Athyrium × awatae</h1>
<p>Athyrium × awatae, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium filix-femina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that display a striking combination of deep green and silvery-white on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a lush, textural addition to shaded gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce spores and is propagated through division of its rhizomes.</p>
