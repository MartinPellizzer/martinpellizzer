                    <h1>Alnus glutinosa var. incisa</h1>
<p>Alnus glutinosa var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical alnus species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
