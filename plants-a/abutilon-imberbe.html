<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and soft, fuzzy texture, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Abutilon imberbe is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon imberbe has alternate, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. Its flowers are pendulous, with five lobes, and are usually yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early autumn, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon imberbe is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, as well as some regions in the Caribbean. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in open woodland areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
