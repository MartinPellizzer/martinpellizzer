                <h1>Acrostichum calomelanos</h1>
<p>Acrostichum calomelanos, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is characterized by its dark, almost black, leathery leaves. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized structures called salt glands. It thrives in coastal areas, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its root system helps stabilize shorelines and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum calomelanos has large, elongated leaves that are typically sword-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, with a dark green coloration on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is robust and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, usually greenish or pale yellow, which bloom during the late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed, fibrous capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum calomelanos is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where the climate is humid and warm. This plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline, often growing in dense clusters. It is an important component of the mangrove and brackish water ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in some parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum calomelanos was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich conditions. This plant is often invasive in non-native habitats, outcompeting native vegetation for space and resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a challenging species to control.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in several regions beyond its original range.</p>
