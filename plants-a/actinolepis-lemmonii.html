                <h1>Actinolepis lemmonii</h1>
<p>Actinolepis lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, and it produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Actinolepis lemmonii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolepis lemmonii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis lemmonii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, including canyon walls and cliffs. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to specific geological formations and microclimates within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis lemmonii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with rocky and arid soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in California, Nevada, and Utah, where it thrives in dry, well-drained environments. This plant is often seen growing in disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its introduction has been largely accidental, resulting from seed dispersal through human activity.</p>
<p>Despite being non-native, it has established itself in these regions and is now considered part of the local flora.</p>
