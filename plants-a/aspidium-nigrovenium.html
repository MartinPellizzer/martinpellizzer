<p>Aspidium nigrovenium, commonly known as the black-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged in water, though some may extend above the surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically dark green with prominent, blackish veins that give it its common name.</p>
<p>Aspidium nigrovenium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
