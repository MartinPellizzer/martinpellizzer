                    <h1>Agrostis vulgaris var. montana</h1>
<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. montana, commonly known as mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, slender leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and tolerance to cold and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
