                    <h1>Arachniodes subaristata</h1>
<p>Arachniodes subaristata, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
