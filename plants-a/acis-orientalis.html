                <h1>Acis orientalis</h1>
<p>Acis orientalis, commonly known as the Persian violet, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Acis orientalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis orientalis has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are delicate, five-petaled white blooms that appear in early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis orientalis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and hot, dry summers. It is particularly associated with areas in southern France, Italy, Spain, and the eastern coast of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Its distribution also extends to parts of Turkey and the Levant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis orientalis was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas along the southern and western coasts of the United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental plant in coastal gardens. The species has also been found in disturbed sites and along roadsides due to its adaptability. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
