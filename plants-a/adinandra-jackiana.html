                <h1>Adinandra jackiana</h1>
<p>Adinandra jackiana, commonly known as the Jack's adinandra, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adinandra jackiana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in forested or shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra jackiana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exhibits a slight longitudinal ridging, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in the soil and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra jackiana is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo, specifically found in the Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within lowland and hill forests, primarily in the northeastern part of Borneo. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typically growing in secondary and primary rainforests. The species is usually found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Adinandra jackiana is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra jackiana is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic traits. The growth cycle of Adinandra jackiana is relatively slow, with significant growth occurring during the rainy season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while diseases like root rot can occur if the soil is overly moist.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adinandra jackiana is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring species in the ecosystem. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity by offering ecological benefits to the local flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adinandra jackiana is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
