<p>Allium eriophyllum, commonly known as the woolly garlic or desert garlic, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs, which are adapted for survival in harsh conditions, are edible and have a mild garlic flavor.</p>
<p>Allium eriophyllum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
