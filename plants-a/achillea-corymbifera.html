<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Achillea corymbifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea corymbifera has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and dark green, with a grayish-white underside, arranged in a rosette pattern and reaching up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are white, arranged in flat, branched clusters called corymbs, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea corymbifera is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa, and the Middle East. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and woodland edges. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is classified as a species of conservation concern in several regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea corymbifera is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, ensuring healthy growth. This plant has a growth cycle that involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
