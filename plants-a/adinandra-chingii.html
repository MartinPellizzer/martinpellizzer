                <h1>Adinandra chingii</h1>
<p>Adinandra chingii, commonly known as the Ching's ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in secondary forest growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra chingii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, growing upright with a branched structure. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and droppings.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra chingii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Vietnam and northern Laos. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is not commonly found in primary tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra chingii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and resilience. It has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to specific habitat requirements and potential ecological impacts.</p>
