<p>Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha var. latifolia has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five white petals and a yellow throat, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's survival in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha var. latifolia is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it occurs in the mountainous regions of provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand, where it has been introduced or naturalized. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests and shrublands. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some areas, though its conservation status varies across its range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha var. latifolia is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds sown in early spring and divisions done in early spring or fall. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and powdery mildew, making companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or rosemary beneficial for natural pest control.</p>
