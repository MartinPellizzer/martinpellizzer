                <h1>Adenandra rosmarinifolia</h1>
<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the Cape rosemary, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is typically found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its essential oils are often used in perfumery and traditional medicine due to their aromatic and therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia has aromatic, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and green, with a slightly woody texture, and they exhibit a climbing growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in spring and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia is a plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is currently found exclusively in its native range on Socotra, where it thrives in specific microhabitats. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich environments, often in dry and arid conditions. It is commonly found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adenandra rosmarinifolia is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia is a versatile evergreen shrub known for its aromatic foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in spring or seeds sown in early autumn. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in spring and prune after flowering to maintain shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can enhance its fragrance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in a mixed vegetation setting. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
