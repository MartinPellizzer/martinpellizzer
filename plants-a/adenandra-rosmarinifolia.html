<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosemary tree, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia is often cultivated for its fragrant foliage and drought-resistant properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia has aromatic, needle-like leaves that are linear, arranged in opposite pairs, and measure approximately 1-2 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the winter months, which are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the eastern and southern regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal areas and mountainous regions of the country. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It is particularly common in the Overberg and Garden Route areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra rosmarinifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for horticultural use. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climates.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact.</p>
