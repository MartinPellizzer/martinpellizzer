                        <h1>Acacia crassa subsp. crassa</h1>
<p>Acacia crassa subsp.</p>
<p>crassa, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its straight, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in compact cylindrical spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia crassa subsp.</p>
<p>crassa belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by their diverse floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure, including legumes. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorned appearance and their ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia crassa, a specific type within the Acacia genus, known for its robust growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia crassa subsp.</p>
<p>crassa is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland. This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia crassa subsp.</p>
<p>crassa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>This species is known for its ability to colonize open habitats quickly, making it a common invader in disturbed ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its success in introduced environments.</p>
<p>However, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in some regions.</p>
