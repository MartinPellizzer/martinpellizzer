                <h1>Aeluropus bombycinus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus bombycinus, commonly known as the desert arrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aeluropus bombycinus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus bombycinus has grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly curved, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green surface, and grows in dense, compact clumps. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, arranged in spikelets, with a wind-pollination method. The fruit is a small, three-angled spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant stabilize in sandy or saline soils.</p>
