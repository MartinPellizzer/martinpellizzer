                    <h1>Anisophyllum humifusum</h1>
<p>Anisophyllum humifusum, commonly known as the low saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Anisophyllum humifusum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine and arctic wildlife.</p>
