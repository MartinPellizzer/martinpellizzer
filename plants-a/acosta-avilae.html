                <h1>Acosta avilae</h1>
<p>Acosta avilae, commonly known as the Avil√°'s acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta avilae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta avilae has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta avilae is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, typically in the mountainous areas of the Andes. This plant thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky or sandy habitats at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta avilae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often seen in lowland areas. Its introduction has led to its spread in several countries across Central and South America.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
