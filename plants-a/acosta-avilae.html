                    <h1>Acosta avilae</h1>
<p>Acosta avilae, commonly known as the Avil√°'s acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta avilae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
