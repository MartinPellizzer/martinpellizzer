                <h1>Acronychia hillii</h1>
<p>Acronychia hillii, commonly known as the Koa tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It is often found in coastal and lowland forests, thriving in humid, warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological and cultural significance, it is also valued for its timber and traditional uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia hillii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form with multiple branches. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in its rocky habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia hillii is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia, specifically Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the wetter regions of the north-eastern part of the country, particularly in the areas around the Cape York Peninsula and the vicinity of the Daintree Rainforest. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly associated with riparian zones and coastal areas. It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other rainforest species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia hillii was mainly introduced to areas with high rainfall and warm, humid climates, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. This plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
