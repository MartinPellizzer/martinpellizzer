                <h1>Acronychia hillii</h1>
<p>Acronychia hillii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Acronychia hillii is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia hillii has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal panicles, blooming from May to July, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing a single seed, and is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in its rocky habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia hillii is a rare evergreen tree native to the island of New Guinea, specifically found in the eastern part of the island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within the highland rainforests of Papua, Indonesia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Acronychia hillii typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acronychia hillii is a rare and hardy shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5â€“7 years, making it suitable for long-term garden projects.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood should be done carefully. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical shrubs or flowering plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy ecosystem.</p>
