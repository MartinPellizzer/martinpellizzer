<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. parviligula has lance-shaped, finely divided leaves that are usually green with a silvery underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy, with a reddish-brown color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. parviligula is a variant of the yarrow plant that is native to Europe, particularly in regions of the Mediterranean and Central Europe.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of North America, where it has been introduced and is now found in various regions, including the western United States. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to around 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variant is generally stable, though it may be considered of least concern due to its adaptability and widespread presence.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. parviligula is a compact, hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and fluffy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and benefit from shared pest deterrence.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. parviligula is a low-growing perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. The plant attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds. Its dense growth habit helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. parviligula is a lesser-known variant of yarrow, known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities, making it useful in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>It has been used historically in culinary applications, such as flavoring teas and infusions, though it is less commonly consumed than other yarrow varieties. In industrial and economic contexts, it may be cultivated for ornamental purposes, contributing to the horticultural industry.
