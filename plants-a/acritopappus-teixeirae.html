                <h1>Acritopappus teixeirae</h1>
<p>Acritopappus teixeirae, commonly known as the Teixeira's acanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the dry regions of Brazil, where it thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant features prominent, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus teixeirae has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green in color and range from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branched. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus teixeirae is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the states of Pernambuco, Paraíba, and Ceará. It thrives in the tropical and subtropical climates of this area. The plant is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of the northeastern Brazilian landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus teixeirae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana. Its introduction has been linked to human activities, including land development and seed dispersal through contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in disturbed environments across its range.</p>
