                <h1>Adansonia bernieri</h1>
<p>Adansonia bernieri, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a member of the Bombacaceae family and is native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores large amounts of water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The tree produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several lobes, and it can grow to impressive heights, often exceeding 20 meters.</p>
<p>The plant is well-adapted to seasonal climates, shedding its leaves during dry periods to conserve moisture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia bernieri has large, thick, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, sprawling pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and clustered in panicles, with white or pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia bernieri is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, arid regions of the island, particularly in the south and southwest. This species thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in association with other endemic flora. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia bernieri was mainly introduced to regions with a tropical climate, particularly in parts of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight. This species is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. It requires a warm and dry environment to flourish, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly found in the wild outside its native range.</p>
