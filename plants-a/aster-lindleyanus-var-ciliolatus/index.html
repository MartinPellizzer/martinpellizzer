                            <h1>Aster Lindleyanus Var. Ciliolatus</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Aster lindleyanus var. ciliolatus, is a strikingly beautiful perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is celebrated for its delicate, blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that appear in late summer and early fall. This plant thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas of the forest floor. Its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native gardens and ecological restoration projects. With its soft, mist-like appearance, it is a favorite among botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
