                <h1>Acianthera chamelopoda</h1>
<p>Acianthera chamelopoda, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and is typically found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other plants.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera chamelopoda has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows upright, with a light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera chamelopoda is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and adjacent lowland areas. This orchid species thrives in humid, shaded environments within montane forests. It is commonly associated with rocky or clayey soils in these habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats in Colombia, reflecting its ecological specialization.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera chamelopoda was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses, particularly in regions with warm climates. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed. The plant's introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ability to spread rapidly in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Proper monitoring and control measures are essential to prevent its negative impact on native flora.</p>
