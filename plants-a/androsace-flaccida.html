                    <h1>Androsace flaccida</h1>
<p>Androsace flaccida, commonly known as the drooping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations.</p>
