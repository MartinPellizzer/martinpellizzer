                    <h1>Ammannia</h1>
<p>Ammannia, commonly known as watergrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plants have small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes, and they produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ammannia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, and some are considered invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in aquatic conditions makes them important components of wetland ecosystems.</p>
