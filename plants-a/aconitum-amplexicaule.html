                <h1>Aconitum amplexicaule</h1>
<p>Aconitum amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features large, palmate leaves that often wrap around the stems, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and prefers well-drained, loamy soil.</p>
<p>Aconitum amplexicaule is part of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum amplexicaule has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with a heart-shaped or spatulate form, dark green in color, and typically measuring 5â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, usually smooth and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are blue to violet in color, arranged in racemes, and have five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming from July to August; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are small, black, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, aiding in the plant's survival in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum amplexicaule is primarily native to Nepal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the cool and moist conditions typical of Nepal's diverse topography.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific habitats within Nepal, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum amplexicaule was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking blue-violet flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in garden settings, particularly in temperate regions where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in landscaping and as a decorative element in gardens. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in natural habitats.</p>
