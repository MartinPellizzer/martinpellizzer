<p>Aspidoglossum breve, commonly known as the dwarf snake plant, is a compact, upright succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that are slightly curved and covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for indoor gardening and low-maintenance plant collections.</p>
