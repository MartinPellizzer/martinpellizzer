                <h1>Acosta grisebachii</h1>
<p>Acosta grisebachii, commonly known as the gray acosta, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticultural trade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta grisebachii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta grisebachii is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes within these areas. The plant thrives in temperate to cold climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with montane ecosystems and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta grisebachii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The distribution has since expanded to parts of Washington and northern California. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
