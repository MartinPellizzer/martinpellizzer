                    <h1>Asterocephalus canescens</h1>
<p>Asterocephalus canescens, commonly known as the silverhead lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost silvery appearance, which is due to the presence of a thick, leathery cortex. This lichen typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. The thallus is crustose, meaning it forms a tight, adherent layer on the substrate.</p>
<p>Asterocephalus canescens is often found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure, making it a common indicator species in certain types of rock formations.</p>
