                <h1>Acrostichum pervium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pervium, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of golden-colored scales. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or near water sources. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The golden fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pervium has long, narrow leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 30 cm in length with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses via wind, and the seeds are small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pervium is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with moist, nutrient-rich soils and is frequently seen in swampy or marshy areas. Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of water bodies and dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pervium plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pervium was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often near water bodies such as rivers, swamps, and coastal areas. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and parts of the United States. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a significant ecological concern in areas where it is not native.</p>
