                <h1>Adina fagifolia</h1>
<p>Adina fagifolia, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and small, elliptical leaflets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Adina fagifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina fagifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface that contrasts with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, with five petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded forest soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina fagifolia is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments with rich soil, often found in the undergrowth of evergreen forests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adina fagifolia is classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though localized threats such as deforestation may impact its populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina fagifolia is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, prized for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 7 years, and thrives in partial shade to full sun depending on the climate.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourages new growth. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while root rot and leaf spot diseases can occur in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina fagifolia is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. Its dense foliage also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Overall, Adina fagifolia plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and soil health in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
