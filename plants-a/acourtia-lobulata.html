                <h1>Acourtia lobulata</h1>
<p>Acourtia lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Acourtia lobulata is often found in California and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia lobulata has leaves that are typically lobed, with a rounded or heart-shaped appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is generally erect, with a rough, hairy texture and a grayish-green color, growing in a clumping or spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five pinkish-white petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia lobulata is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is commonly associated with desert scrub habitats. Acourtia lobulata is often found in elevations ranging from lowlands to moderate mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia lobulata was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant has become naturalized in these regions, often thriving in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various dune and beach environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas.</p>
