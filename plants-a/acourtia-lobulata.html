                <h1>Acourtia lobulata</h1>
<p>Acourtia lobulata, commonly known as the stickyleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, waxy leaves that produce a sticky substance when crushed. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs that aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Acourtia lobulata is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia lobulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and erect, with a slightly hairy texture and a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia lobulata is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Acourtia lobulata typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as a species of concern and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acourtia lobulata is a low-maintenance flowering plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acourtia lobulata is perennial, with blooming typically occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during the growing season, but it should be avoided in the winter to prevent root rot. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead flowers to encourage new growth. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary can help deter pests and improve the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acourtia lobulata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acourtia lobulata contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and promoting the growth of other native flora.</p>
