                    <h1>Alnus incana var. bipinnatifida</h1>
<p>Alnus incana var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
