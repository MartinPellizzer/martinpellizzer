<p>Arctium concolor, commonly known as the purple burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, purplish-brown bracts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stem, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Arctium concolor is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
