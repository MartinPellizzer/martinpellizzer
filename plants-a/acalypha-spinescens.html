<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha spinescens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories or disturbed sites. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated gardens or as an ornamental plant in warmer climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha spinescens was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
