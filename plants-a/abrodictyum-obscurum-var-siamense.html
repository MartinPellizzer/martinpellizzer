<p>Abrodictyum obscurum var. siamense, commonly known as the Siam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like leaves and its striking, ghostly white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
