<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii var. dissectum has finely dissected, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, giving them a feathery appearance, with a bright green color during the growing season and a vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod, which disperses by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, though they are not particularly deep.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>

<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the states of Guanajuato and Quer√©taro. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within temperate forests and cloud forests. This variant typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii var. dissectum is a striking ornamental maple known for its delicate, finely dissected foliage that adds visual interest to gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal traits. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5-7 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and remove dead wood.
