<p>Abrus pulchellus subsp.</p>
<p>suffruticosus, commonly known as the red devil's backbone, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces distinctive, pendulous pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds with a bright red aril, which is the fleshy covering around the seed. The seeds are highly toxic due to the presence of abrin, a potent lectin.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
