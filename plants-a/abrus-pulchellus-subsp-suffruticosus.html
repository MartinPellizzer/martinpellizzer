                        <h1>Abrus pulchellus subsp. suffruticosus</h1>
<p>Abrus pulchellus subsp.</p>
<p>suffruticosus, commonly known as the red devil's backbone, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces distinctive, pendulous pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds with a bright red aril, which is the fleshy covering around the seed. The seeds are highly toxic due to the presence of abrin, a potent lectin.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus pulchellus subsp.</p>
<p>suffruticosus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland areas with humid climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in open forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to warm, moist environments and is often seen as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus pulchellus subsp.</p>
<p>suffruticosus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and as a decorative plant in gardens due to its distinctive red and white flower clusters. It is commonly cultivated in warm climates where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. However, it contains toxic seeds that can be harmful if ingested, so caution is necessary when handling or planting it.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its presence in various regions outside its native habitat.</p>
