<p>Aspidium commutatum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover.</p>
<p>Aspidium commutatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
