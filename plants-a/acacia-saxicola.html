                    <h1>Acacia saxicola</h1>
<p>Acacia saxicola, commonly known as the rock acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well adapted to rocky and sandy terrains.</p>
<p>Acacia saxicola is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
