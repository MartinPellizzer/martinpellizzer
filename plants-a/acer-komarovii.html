                <h1>Acer komarovii</h1>
<p>Acer komarovii, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aceraceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn red or yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent tree.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, providing stability and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, reflecting its restricted habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in mixed forests. The plant grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat fragmentation, Acer komarovii is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer komarovii includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead or diseased branches. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like powdery mildew can affect it, though it is generally resistant to many plant diseases.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, offering shade and habitat in mixed forest ecosystems. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its seeds have been explored for nutritional value.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used in some regions for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture, though its economic impact remains modest. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain areas of its native habitat, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and traditional rather than widespread in modern contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking yellow or variegated foliage. The species is also frequently used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and vibrant fall color. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various climates and its ability to contribute to the genetic diversity of maple trees.</p>
<p>These characteristics make Acer komarovii a significant plant in both landscape design and botanical research.</p>
