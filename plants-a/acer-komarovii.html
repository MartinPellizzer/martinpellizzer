                <h1>Acer komarovii</h1>
<p>Acer komarovii, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Acer komarovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color during the growing season, turning red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a fast growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate trees, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the tree and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to its native range due to its specific ecological requirements. It thrives in temperate forests and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils and a humid climate. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acer komarovii is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and overexploitation, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii is a hardy deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer komarovii includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and leaf senescence in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-tolerant plants can enhance its aesthetic and ecological value in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and abundant nectar. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the local ecosystem by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and workability, making it suitable for furniture and construction. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in traditional Chinese medicine and horticulture.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer komarovii plays a role in both ecological systems and human activities, though its applications are more limited compared to other maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer komarovii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Crimson King', which are known for their striking foliage colors. The species is also used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced traits. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>These characteristics make it a desirable choice for horticulturists and landscape designers.</p>
