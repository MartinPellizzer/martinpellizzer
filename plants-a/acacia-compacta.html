                        <h1>Acacia compacta</h1>
<p>Acacia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that appear in globular clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia compacta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia compacta is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It often grows in clusters, forming dense thickets that provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia compacta is an important component of the local ecosystem and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia compacta was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and capacity to provide shade and habitat for local wildlife. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands across several countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
