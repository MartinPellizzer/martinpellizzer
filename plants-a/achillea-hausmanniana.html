                <h1>Achillea hausmanniana</h1>
<p>Achillea hausmanniana, commonly known as the Hausmann's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens with its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea hausmanniana has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a rough texture and a diameter of up to 10 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea hausmanniana is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of Turkey and Syria.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other areas, including parts of Europe and the United States, where it is occasionally cultivated. It thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodland, meadows, and along rocky outcrops. This species typically grows at elevations between 500 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare species and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea hausmanniana is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flowers and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant enters a dormant growth cycle in winter, emerging in early spring and blooming throughout the summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower heads to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea hausmanniana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense growth habit helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or sandy areas.</p>
<p>Achillea hausmanniana also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a diverse array of ecological interactions in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea hausmanniana is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, known for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It has been utilized in various cultural practices, often symbolizing resilience and healing. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has potential for medicinal purposes due to its bioactive compounds.
