                <h1>Acinos clinopodiifacie</h1>
<p>Acinos clinopodiifacie, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acinos, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and closely arranged, giving it a dense, compact appearance.</p>
<p>Acinos clinopodiifacie is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos clinopodiifacie has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white, with five petals and a distinct tubular throat, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos clinopodiifacie is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, rocky habitats such as hillsides, slopes, and dry meadows. This species thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often associated with serpentine soils, which are rich in minerals but low in nutrients.</p>
<p>Acinos clinopodiifacie is an important component of the native flora in these areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos clinopodiifacie was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and small flowers. This species has since spread into natural areas, often competing with native vegetation. It is considered a non-native invasive species in parts of its range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding due to its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions.</p>
