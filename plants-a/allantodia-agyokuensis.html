<p>Allantodia agyokuensis, commonly known as the Agyoku's Allantodia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves and hairy stems. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Allantodia agyokuensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
