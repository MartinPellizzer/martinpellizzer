                            <h1>Azalea Catawbiensis</h1>
<p>Azalea catawbiensis is a rare and beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is known for its vibrant pink and white blooms that appear in the spring. This species is closely related to the rhododendron family and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its striking appearance makes it a valuable addition to botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
