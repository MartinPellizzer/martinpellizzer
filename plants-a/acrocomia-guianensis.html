                <h1>Acrocomia guianensis</h1>
<p>Acrocomia guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched stem with a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into woody, three-angled fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching.</p>
<p>The Guianan palm is adapted to tropical climates and is often found in wetland or swampy areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia guianensis has palm-like leaves that are typically elongated, feather-shaped, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, with a dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upward in a single trunk. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a yellowish color and are pollinated by insects, blooming during the dry season. The fruit is a spiny, three-lobed capsule that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia guianensis is primarily native to South America, specifically the Amazon Basin and parts of the Guianas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in swampy or wetland habitats. It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used by indigenous communities for its practical and cultural value.</p>
<p>Acrocomia guianensis is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia guianensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential economic use.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, such as parts of South America and the Caribbean. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its unique appearance and adaptability. Its introduction has been driven by horticultural interest and the demand for drought-resistant plants.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
