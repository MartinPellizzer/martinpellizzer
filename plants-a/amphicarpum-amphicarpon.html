                    <h1>Amphicarpum amphicarpon</h1>
<p>Amphicarpum amphicarpon, commonly known as the double-seeded grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to produce two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground. The above-ground fruit is typically a small, dry capsule, while the underground fruit is a larger, fleshy structure that develops in the soil. This dual fruiting strategy allows the plant to maximize its reproductive success in various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
