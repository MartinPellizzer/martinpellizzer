                <h1>Achillea pseudodorata</h1>
<p>Achillea pseudodorata, commonly known as the lesser yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the mythological figure Achilles, who was said to have used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudodorata has leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) enclosed in a pappus of bristles, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>
