                <h1>Acomastylis elata</h1>
<p>Acomastylis elata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a compact, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets that bloom in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Acomastylis elata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its succulent leaves and stems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis elata has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a gray-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that is slightly fissured, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis elata is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape Province, particularly in the fynbos biome. This plant typically grows in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils. It thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Acomastylis elata is often found in open, sunny habitats such as slopes and flats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis elata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various habitats. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites throughout the country. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand.</p>
