<p>Acystopteris tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender-veined rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided, thread-like pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Acystopteris tenuisecta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
