                <h1>Acystopteris tenuisecta</h1>
<p>Acystopteris tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender-veined rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided, thread-like pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Acystopteris tenuisecta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acystopteris tenuisecta has leaves that are typically small, lanceolate in shape, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a thin, papery texture, and can range from 1 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. This fern does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and its reproductive structures are instead spore cases called sori.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acystopteris tenuisecta is primarily native to Assam, Borneo, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, Japan, Jawa, Malaya, Maluku, Myanmar, Nepal, New Guinea, Philippines, Sulawesi, Taiwan, Thailand, Tibet, Vietnam, and West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant is known for its delicate fronds and is often associated with humid climates.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution spans multiple countries in Asia, reflecting its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acystopteris tenuisecta was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rich, organic soils and is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas. This fern is commonly spread through human activity, such as the movement of soil or plant material. It can establish itself in gardens, forest edges, and along trails.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
