                    <h1>Apinus pinea</h1>
<p>Apinus pinea, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and small, oval-shaped cones. The tree has a shallow root system adapted to the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in reforestation projects in high-altitude regions.</p>
