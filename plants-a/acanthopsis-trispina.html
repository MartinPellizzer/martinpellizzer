                        <h1>Acanthopsis trispina</h1>
<p>Acanthopsis trispina, commonly known as the three-spined acanthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiny calyx and showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or purple. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopsis trispina is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, thriving in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. This plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It is often seen growing in open grasslands and along the edges of shrublands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soil and minimal competition from other vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopsis trispina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1980s and has since spread throughout the North Island. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is considered a weed due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited by climate and soil conditions.</p>
