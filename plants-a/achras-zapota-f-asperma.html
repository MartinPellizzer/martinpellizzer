                <h1>Achras zapota f. asperma</h1>
<p>Achras zapota f. asperma, commonly known as the rough sapote, is a tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a fruit with a thick, inedible outer layer and a sweet, edible pulp inside. Its latex sap has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras zapota f. asperma has simple, alternate, elliptical or ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny, globose capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it thrive in tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras zapota f. asperma is a variant of the chicle tree native to southern Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Caribbean, including Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Lesser Antilles. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, typically in moist lowland areas. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its natural habitat and limited cultivation, it is considered of low conservation concern, though habitat loss poses a potential threat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras zapota f. asperma is a fast-growing, tropical plant known for its ornamental value and edible fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desirable traits. The plant has a long growth cycle, often reaching maturity in 3-5 years, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, especially during the growing season, but should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage fruit production. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras zapota f. asperma is a tropical tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a natural erosion control measure due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil in coastal and tropical regions. It also serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, supporting the growth of other crops.</p>
<p>Additionally, its fruit offers nutritional benefits to both humans and animals, contributing to local food security.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras zapota f. asperma is a tropical plant with various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
