                <h1>Adonis distortoides</h1>
<p>Adonis distortoides, commonly known as the twisted bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis distortoides has compound, pinnate leaves that are finely divided, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically have a bluish-green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and woody at the base, with a smooth, pale green bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a central orange-red disk, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis distortoides is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and moist woodlands. This plant thrives in regions with mild, wet winters and cool, dry summers. It is often associated with serpentine soils, which are rich in minerals but low in nutrients.</p>
<p>Adonis distortoides plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting local pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis distortoides was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun exposure and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments. The plant has been reported in several states across the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Utah. Its rapid growth and ability to establish itself in disturbed areas contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat in most regions where it is found.</p>
