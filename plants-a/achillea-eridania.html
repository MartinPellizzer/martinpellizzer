                <h1>Achillea eridania</h1>
<p>Achillea eridania, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically white to pale pink.</p>
<p>Achillea eridania is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea eridania has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and spread in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea eridania is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas along the coastal regions and mountain ranges of these states. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal bluffs. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as threatened or endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea eridania is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flower heads and silvery-gray foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering promote compact growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea eridania is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other species to enhance soil health and promote mutual growth. Its dense growth habit also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea eridania offers ecological benefits by supporting local fauna and improving the overall resilience of the habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea eridania is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it can be grown as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes.
