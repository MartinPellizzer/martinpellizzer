                <h1>Adenanthos cygnorum subsp. cygnorum</h1>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum subsp.</p>
<p>cygnorum, commonly known as the grey kangaroo paw, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, claw-like flowers that are typically grey or pale pink in color.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum subsp.</p>
<p>cygnorum has narrowly elliptic, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a leathery texture. The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with yellow petals and a distinctive tubular shape, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through dryness, and the seeds are small, dry, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum subsp.</p>
<p>cygnorum is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the south-western region of Western Australia. Its current distribution is extremely limited, with only a few known populations found in the Fitzgerald River National Park.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sandy soils within open forests and woodlands, typically in areas with high sunlight exposure. This subspecies is found at altitudes ranging from 50 to 200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is listed as critically endangered under the Western Australian Conservation Act and the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum subsp.</p>
<p>cygnorum is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to Australia, prized for its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers. It can be propagated through seed or cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics.</p>
<p>This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Fertilization should be minimal, using a balanced fertilizer in spring, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage blooming.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though occasional aphid infestations may occur, and it pairs well with native grasses and shrubs in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum subsp.</p>
<p>cygnorum is a native Australian plant that provides food and shelter for local wildlife, including insects and small mammals. It attracts a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecological balance. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control along coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting a range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum subsp.</p>
<p>cygnorum is a rare and unique plant native to Australia, known for its striking pink flowers and ecological significance. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it holds cultural value for Indigenous communities who may incorporate it into traditional practices.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance highlights its importance in environmental conservation. Due to its limited distribution and fragility, it is also of interest in botanical research and horticultural conservation efforts.</p>
<p>However, it does not have significant industrial or economic applications outside of its ecological and cultural roles.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cygnorum subsp.</p>
<p>cygnorum has several popular cultivars, including 'Bleeding Heart' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage and floral display. It is also known for its natural hybrids with other Adenanthos species, contributing to its genetic diversity in horticultural collections.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit enhanced vigor and ornamental traits, making them popular in gardens and landscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it holds significant horticultural importance in Australian gardens.</p>
<p>Its cultivation helps preserve native plant biodiversity while offering aesthetic value to the landscape.</p>
