                <h1>Achnatherum effusum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum effusum, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achnatherum effusum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration ecology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum effusum has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and linear in shape, with a bluish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright and often forming dense clumps. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brown spikelets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, two-chambered capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum effusum is primarily native to temperate regions of Asia, including China, Mongolia, and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada. This grass species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, steppes, and rocky slopes. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from lowlands to mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with arid and semi-arid climates where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum effusum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah. This plant thrives in full sun and is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activities and climate change.</p>
