                <h1>Aegiphila sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Aegiphila sessiliflora, commonly known as the Brazilian heather, is a shrub native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Aegiphila sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila sessiliflora has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and stamens, blooming in spring and relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native arid or rocky habitats.</p>
