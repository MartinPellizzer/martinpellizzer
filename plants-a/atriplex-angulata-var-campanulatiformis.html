<p>Atriplex angulata var. campanulatiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, succulent leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
