                    <h1>Arthrophytum korovinii</h1>
<p>Arthrophytum korovinii, commonly known as the Korovin's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and resilience, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in desert climates.</p>
