                    <h1>Asplenium marinum var. marinum</h1>
<p>Asplenium marinum var. marinum, commonly known as the sea spleenwort, is a perennial fern that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. This variety is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist areas near the shore. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the environment.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
