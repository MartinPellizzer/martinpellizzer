                    <h1>Arenaria gypsophiloides var. viscosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria gypsophiloides var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important species for stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
