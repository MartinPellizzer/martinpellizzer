                <h1>Achyranthes splendens var. reflexa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes splendens var. reflexa, commonly known as the redroot false spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes splendens var. reflexa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes splendens var. reflexa is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern and eastern Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forest understories, along riverbanks, and in disturbed areas with high humidity. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited range, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
