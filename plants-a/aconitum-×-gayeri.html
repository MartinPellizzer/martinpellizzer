<p>Aconitum × gayeri, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Aconitum napellus and Aconitum lycoctonum, resulting in a plant with striking violet-blue flowers. The plant features large, pleated leaves that are typically heart-shaped and deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
