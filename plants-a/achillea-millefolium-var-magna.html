                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. magna</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. magna, commonly known as giant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and showy clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. It has a long flowering period, usually from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the standard Achillea millefolium, with more robust foliage and extended bloom time.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. magna has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a light green to pale yellow color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that contains small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. magna is a variant of the yarrow plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends into parts of Europe and North America, often as a result of human introduction. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status that warrants attention.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. magna is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>
