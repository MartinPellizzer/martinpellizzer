                <h1>Achillea barrelieri</h1>
<p>Achillea barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, displaying a compact growth habit with narrow, silver-green leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, appearing in flat-topped clusters, and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Achillea barrelieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a slightly hairy surface and a pale green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in parts of France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across the Pyrenees and the Alps, where it thrives in rocky and open habitats. This species prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often growing on slopes and in meadows. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea barrelieri is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division or seed, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Achillea barrelieri involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, and regular pruning helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its blooms for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea barrelieri contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through its natural resilience.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia, known for its medicinal and ornamental uses.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.
