                <h1>Achillea barrelieri</h1>
<p>Achillea barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or poor soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific habitats in these areas, although it is not widely cultivated outside its native range. This plant thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in limestone soils. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea barrelieri is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri is a hardy perennial known for its showy, flat-topped flower heads and feathery foliage, often used in garden landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Achillea barrelieri is typically annual, with the plant germinating in spring, flowering in summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases such as root rot can occur in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or coneflower can enhance its appearance and support beneficial insect activity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri is a plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting the health of surrounding plant life.</p>
