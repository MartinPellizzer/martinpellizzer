                <h1>Aconitum pilipes</h1>
<p>Aconitum pilipes, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a coarse texture and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Aconitum pilipes contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pilipes has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring up to 10 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes, and have a spurred structure, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds with tufts of hair, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pilipes is primarily native to Austria, France, Germany, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in alpine and subalpine regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in meadows and forested areas. Aconitum pilipes is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the mountainous landscapes of Central Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pilipes was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
