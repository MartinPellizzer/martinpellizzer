                <h1>Acriopsis javanica var. floribunda</h1>
<p>Acriopsis javanica var. floribunda, commonly known as the Javanic thistle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis javanica var. floribunda has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis javanica var. floribunda is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these regions, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical areas around the world. It thrives in humid environments, often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered a non-invasive species with no major conservation status concerns, though its distribution may be limited due to habitat fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acriopsis javanica var. floribunda is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and ornate foliage, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking visual interest.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results and greater genetic consistency. This plant thrives in a warm, sunny location with well-draining soil, requiring regular watering to maintain moist but not waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer promotes robust growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
