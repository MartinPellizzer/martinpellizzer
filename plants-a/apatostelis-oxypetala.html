                    <h1>Apatostelis oxypetala</h1>
<p>Apatostelis oxypetala, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Apatostelis oxypetala plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
