<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in alpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale yellow composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea aizoon is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aizoon has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a dark green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, growing from the base to a height of about 30-60 cm. Its flowers are white to pale yellow, arranged in flat, composite heads with ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aizoon is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East, including parts of Turkey, Iran, and Iraq.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of Europe, particularly in southern regions like Spain and Italy, as well as in some areas of North Africa. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea aizoon is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its populations are relatively localized and may be vulnerable to habitat loss.</p>
