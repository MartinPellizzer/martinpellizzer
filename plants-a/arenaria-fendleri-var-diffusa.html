                    <h1>Arenaria fendleri var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Arenaria fendleri var. diffusa, commonly known as desert sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and often appear in pairs along the stems, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
