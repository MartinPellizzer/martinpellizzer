                    <h1>Amauria rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Amauria rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf amaura, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, round, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
