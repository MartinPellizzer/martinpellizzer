                <h1>Achyranthes rubrofusca</h1>
<p>Achyranthes rubrofusca, commonly known as red-fusca knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring erect, branched stems that are often reddish in color. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rubrofusca has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length and having a dark green color with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pale green to reddish bracts, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rubrofusca is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained to moderately wet soils. It is often encountered in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Assam.</p>
<p>Its distribution also extends to some parts of Africa and the Caribbean, though it is most prevalent in its native Asian range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rubrofusca was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and agricultural fields due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils make it a potential invasive species in non-native regions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant, which contributes to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can lead to competition with native vegetation, raising concerns about ecological impact.</p>
