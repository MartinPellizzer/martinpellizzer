                <h1>Acalypha distans</h1>
<p>Acalypha distans, commonly known as the redleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often reddish or purple-colored leaves, which are opposite and usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by three-winged fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in warmer climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha distans has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp that splits into three nutlets, dispersing by wind due to its light, feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in water absorption during dry periods.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha distans is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, including parts of Oceania and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Acalypha distans is typically found at altitudes below 1,000 meters, where the climate is warm and moist.</p>
<p>Currently, it is not considered threatened, but its conservation status may vary depending on local habitat preservation and human activity.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha distans is a tropical plant known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value, often grown as a houseplant or in shaded gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions with indirect light.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, but should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids or root rot if conditions are not properly managed.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or peace lilies can enhance its growth in shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha distans is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy bracts and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by supporting a range of insect and bird life in its habitat.</p>
