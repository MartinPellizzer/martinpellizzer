<p>Arenaria grandiflora subsp.</p>
<p>grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and delicate floral display.</p>
