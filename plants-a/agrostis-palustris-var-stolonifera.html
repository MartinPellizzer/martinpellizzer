<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally through runners. It thrives in well-drained to moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
