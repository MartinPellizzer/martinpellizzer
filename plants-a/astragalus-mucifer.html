<p>Astragalus mucifer, commonly known as the sticky milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by pods containing several small, rounded seeds. Astragalus mucifer is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
