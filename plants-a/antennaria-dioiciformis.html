<p>Antennaria dioiciformis, commonly known as the dioiciform lady's-mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant exhibits dioecious reproduction, with separate male and female plants, a feature that is uncommon in the genus Antennaria. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette and are covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Antennaria dioiciformis is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy species found in rocky, barren, or sandy soils.</p>
