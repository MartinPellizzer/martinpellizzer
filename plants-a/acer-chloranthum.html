                <h1>Acer chloranthum</h1>
<p>Acer chloranthum, commonly known as the yellow maples, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow leaves, which turn a vibrant orange-red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters and has a spreading, rounded canopy. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum has palmately compound leaves that are bright green, with 5 to 7 leaflets arranged radiating from a central point, each leaflet being oval-shaped, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length, and exhibiting a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips as the tree matures. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in corymbs, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, with seeds enclosed in a papery, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in moist, temperate forests at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer chloranthum is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this rare species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum is a decorative maple species known for its striking yellow leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or scale insects in stressed conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or heathers can enhance its visual appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest understories, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil stability. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which helps bind soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a range of ecological benefits by fostering a habitat for both flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum is a species of maple known for its unique yellow flowers and ornamental value, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may be occasionally used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though scientific evidence remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing wood for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often featured in local folklore and artistic expressions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum', known for its striking variegated leaves, and 'Aureum', which displays golden foliage. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as growth habit, leaf color, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids are of significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely used in ornamental horticulture, adding visual interest to both residential and public spaces.</p>
