                <h1>Acer chloranthum</h1>
<p>Acer chloranthum, commonly known as the yellow maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow leaves, which turn a vibrant orange-red in the fall. The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes white-tinged underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in corymbs, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and scattered, with populations primarily confined to isolated mountain areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests and is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer chloranthum is considered vulnerable and faces threats to its survival.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum is a small, deciduous tree known for its striking yellow leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Acer chloranthum involves active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by enhancing soil quality and offering habitat for numerous organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum is a rare flowering tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its flowers may be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, enhancing ecosystem stability.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer chloranthum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking yellow and variegated foliage. Hybrids of Acer chloranthum are often created to enhance traits such as growth habit, foliage color, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their unique leaf patterns and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in temperate regions for their aesthetic appeal and seasonal interest.</p>
