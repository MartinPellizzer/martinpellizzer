<p>Arctium nidulans, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which later develop into spiny, seed-containing burs. Its roots are thick and fibrous, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
<p>Arctium nidulans is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
