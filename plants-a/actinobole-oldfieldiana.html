                <h1>Actinobole oldfieldiana</h1>
<p>Actinobole oldfieldiana, commonly known as the Oldfield's actinobole, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinobole oldfieldiana has leaves that are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals, and bloom in early summer; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinobole oldfieldiana is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton and Shark Bay areas. This plant typically grows in coastal and saline environments, often on sandplain and limestone soils. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and localized species within Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinobole oldfieldiana was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed soils in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with compacted soil and limited vegetation, often colonizing vacant lots and construction sites. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions where it competes with native flora.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
