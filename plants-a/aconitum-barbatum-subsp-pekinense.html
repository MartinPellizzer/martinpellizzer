                <h1>Aconitum barbatum subsp. pekinense</h1>
<p>Aconitum barbatum subsp.</p>
<p>pekinense, commonly known as the Peking aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spathaceous flowers.</p>
<p>The plant features a stout, hairy stem that often branches towards the top. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and are covered in a dense layer of hairs. Aconitum barbatum subsp.</p>
<p>pekinense is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum barbatum subsp.</p>
<p>pekinense has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age.</p>
<p>Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred petal, and bloom in late summer; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum barbatum subsp.</p>
<p>pekinense is a perennial herb native to northern China, specifically the regions of Hebei and Liaoning provinces. Its current distribution is primarily limited to these areas, although it may occasionally be found in nearby regions with similar climates.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as forests and mountainous areas, often growing along stream banks or in rocky soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a species of conservation concern, with its status listed as near threatened in some regional assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum barbatum subsp.</p>
<p>pekinense is a striking perennial plant known for its showy blue or purple flowers and upright growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in late summer to early fall after a period of active growth in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry spells, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, and pruning dead foliage in late fall helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum barbatum subsp.</p>
<p>pekinense is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its vibrant flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates, supporting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum barbatum subsp.</p>
<p>pekinense is a member of the Ranunculaceae family known for its ornamental value in gardens due to its striking blue to purple flowers. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it has historical significance in traditional medicine, where its roots were occasionally used for their analgesic properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic nature, it is not suitable for industrial or economic applications. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and can symbolize beauty and resilience in certain regions.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains ornamental, with limited traditional medicinal use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Aconitum barbatum subsp.</p>
<p>pekinense has several popular cultivars such as 'Blue Magic' and 'Carnegie Blue,' which are prized for their striking blue-purple flowers and robust growth. It is also frequently used in hybrid breeding programs to enhance traits like flower color, size, and cold hardiness.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this subspecies often combine its vigor with the ornamental qualities of other Aconitum species. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments and its role in creating diverse garden displays.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and aesthetic value, it remains a favored choice among gardeners and plant breeders.</p>
