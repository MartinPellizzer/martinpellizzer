                    <h1>Aira vivipara</h1>
<p>Aira vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. One notable botanical feature is its viviparity, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This unique reproductive strategy aids in its survival in various environmental conditions.</p>
