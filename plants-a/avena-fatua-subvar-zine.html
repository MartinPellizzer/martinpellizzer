                    <h1>Avena fatua subvar. zine</h1>
<p>Avena fatua subvar. zine, commonly known as false wheat, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can persist in the soil for several years, contributing to its invasive potential.</p>
