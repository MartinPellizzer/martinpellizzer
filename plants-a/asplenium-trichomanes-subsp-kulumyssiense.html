<p>Asplenium trichomanes subsp.</p>
<p>kulumyssiense, commonly known as the Kulumyssi fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, clustered fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
