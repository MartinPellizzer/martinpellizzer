                <h1>Achyrospermum ciliatum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum ciliatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum ciliatum has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and have a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, often branching, with a rough, greenish-brown bark. Its flowers are yellow with five petals, arranged in clusters, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum ciliatum is primarily native to Cameroon, Congo, DR Congo, and Gabon.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical rainforest regions of these countries. It thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. The species is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to Central Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum ciliatum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through accidental means, such as being transported in soil or plant material. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native vegetation. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it poses a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further colonization.</p>
