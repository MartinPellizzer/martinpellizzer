<p>Amberboa crupinoides var. libyca, commonly known as the Libyan amberboa, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing desert landscapes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
