<p>Agrostis scabra var. elatior, commonly known as the tall bentsgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
