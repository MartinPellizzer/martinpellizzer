                <h1>Aconitum quelpaertense</h1>
<p>Aconitum quelpaertense, commonly known as the Jeju aconite, is a perennial herb native to the island of Jeju in South Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant produces large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle.</p>
<p>Aconitum quelpaertense is often found in moist, rocky soils in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum quelpaertense has compound, deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, and consist of five petals arranged in a helmet-like structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The plant produces a follicle-type fruit that releases seeds through mechanical means when ripe.</p>
<p>Its roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum quelpaertense is primarily native to Korea.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the southern and western parts. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in forested areas or along stream banks. Its natural habitat includes rocky soils and shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>It is an important species in the flora of Korea, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum quelpaertense was mainly introduced to South Korea.</p>
<p>It was first discovered on the island of Quelpaert, which is part of the Jeju Island group. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread in natural habitats. It has been reported in several regions of South Korea, including the coastal areas and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among local ecologists due to its potential impact on native flora.</p>
