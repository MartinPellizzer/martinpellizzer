<p>Andropogon lateralis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, bluish-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable.</p>
<p>Andropogon lateralis is also used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
