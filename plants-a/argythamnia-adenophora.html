<p>Argythamnia adenophora, commonly known as the silverleaf thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically spiny and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Argythamnia adenophora is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
