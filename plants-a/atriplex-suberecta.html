<p>Atriplex suberecta, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, enhancing its drought tolerance. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Atriplex suberecta is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
