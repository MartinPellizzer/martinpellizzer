                <h1>Adelphia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Adelphia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved adelphia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are large, often measuring up to 30 centimeters in length, and are arranged oppositely along the stems.</p>
<p>Adelphia macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelphia macrophylla has large, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelphia macrophylla is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, forested areas with rich soil. The species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelphia macrophylla was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread into native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a potential weed in some regions of the state.</p>
