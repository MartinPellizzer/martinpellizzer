<p>Asplenium capillipes subsp.</p>
<p>fugax, commonly known as the fugitive maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
