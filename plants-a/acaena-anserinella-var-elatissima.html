<p>The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena anserinella var. elatissima is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andean foothills and valleys. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with shrublands and grassy slopes. It is an important component of the native flora in these areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena anserinella var. elatissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly adaptable to different environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
