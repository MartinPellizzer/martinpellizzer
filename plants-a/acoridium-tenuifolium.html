                    <h1>Acoridium tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Acoridium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf water plantain, is a species of aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Acoridium tenuifolium plays an important role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
