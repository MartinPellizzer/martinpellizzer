<p>Acrostichum dichotomum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each frond splits into two equal parts, creating a distinctive appearance. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy, with a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>The split fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>
