                <h1>Acrostichum dichotomum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum dichotomum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each frond splits into two equal parts, creating a distinctive appearance. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy, with a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>The split fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum dichotomum has frond-like leaves that are feather-shaped (pinnate) with a dark green color, arranged in a rosette pattern, and can grow up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spore-bearing sorus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum dichotomum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This fern thrives in humid, moist environments with rich soil, often growing in dense clusters. Its natural range extends from the southeastern United States down through the Caribbean and into northern South America.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum dichotomum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial to full shade. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often colonizing abandoned agricultural land. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in wetland restoration projects due to its competitive nature.</p>
