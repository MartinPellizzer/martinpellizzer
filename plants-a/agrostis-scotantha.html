                    <h1>Agrostis scotantha</h1>
<p>Agrostis scotantha, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. The plant has fine, slender leaves that are often tufted at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Agrostis scotantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
