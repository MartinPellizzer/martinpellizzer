                        <h1>Acacia muelleri</h1>
<p>Acacia muelleri, commonly known as the grey acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often greyish branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Acacia muelleri is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora.</p>
