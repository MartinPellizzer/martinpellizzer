                        <h1>Acetosella beringensis</h1>
<p>Acetosella beringensis, commonly known as Bering's sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense cushions or mats to survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation emerges. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acetosella beringensis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing permafrost soils in its native habitat.</p>
