                    <h1>Astronidium fragilissimum</h1>
<p>Astronidium fragilissimum, commonly known as the fragile starling tree, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
