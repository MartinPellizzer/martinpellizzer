                <h1>Acrostichum decoratum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum decoratum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, palmately divided fronds that can grow up to two meters in length, with a distinctive golden hue along the frond margins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum decoratum has large, feather-like leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a deep green color that turns bronze in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops a rough texture as the plant ages, and it grows in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum decoratum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and brackish water environments. This plant thrives in humid climates with high salinity levels and is often associated with estuarine ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is an important component of the coastal flora in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum decoratum was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it thrives in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in non-native habitats.</p>
