                    <h1>Avena tentoensis</h1>
<p>Avena tentoensis, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly achenes, which are dispersed by the wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a minor weed in agricultural settings.</p>
