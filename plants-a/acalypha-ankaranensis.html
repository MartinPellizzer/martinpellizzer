<p>Acalypha ankaranensis, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, fibrous wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often green or reddish in color, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha ankaranensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ankaranensis is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar, specifically found in the eastern part of the island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated areas within the northeastern region of Madagascar. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in dense forests or secondary vegetation. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acalypha ankaranensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
