                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. subaristata</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. subaristata, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
