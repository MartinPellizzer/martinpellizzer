                <h1>Acrophorus hispidus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy acanthus, is a striking plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences that range in color from red to purple, adding visual interest to its overall structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and vibrant flowers, Acrophorus hispidus is often cultivated for both its aesthetic value and its ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus hispidus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with short, stiff hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus hispidus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary vegetation and can be found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the eastern and central parts of the African continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus hispidus was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of Africa. This plant has been introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to grow in a variety of conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and environmental suitability.</p>
