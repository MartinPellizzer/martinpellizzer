                <h1>Acriopsis griffithii</h1>
<p>Acriopsis griffithii, commonly known as the Indian cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its edible seeds and leaves.</p>
<p>Acriopsis griffithii is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis griffithii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, varying in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, and usually have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in dense panicles, with white to pale yellow petals and a sweet scent, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis griffithii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia, including parts of Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky terrains. This plant is well adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat. It is commonly found in the Himalayan range and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, its distribution is limited to these particular geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis griffithii was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticulture and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in areas with moderate to high levels of sunlight. The plant's ability to spread via seeds carried by wind or water has contributed to its establishment in non-native regions. It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
