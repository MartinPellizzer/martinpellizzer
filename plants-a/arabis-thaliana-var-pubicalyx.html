                    <h1>Arabis thaliana var. pubicalyx</h1>
<p>Arabis thaliana var. pubicalyx, commonly known as the pubicalyx rockcress, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, pubescent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to Arabis thaliana, the model organism in plant biology, but differs in its pubescent foliage and ecological preferences.</p>
