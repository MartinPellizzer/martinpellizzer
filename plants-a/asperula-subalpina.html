<p>Asperula subalpina, commonly known as the alpine sweet pepper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring.

<p>Asperula subalpina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
