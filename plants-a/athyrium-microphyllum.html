<p>Athyrium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often adorned with a pale, almost metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread slowly across the ground.</p>
<p>The leaves are bi-lobed and have a unique, almost lace-like appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
