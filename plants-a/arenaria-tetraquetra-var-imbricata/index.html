<p>Arenaria tetraquetra var. imbricata is a low-growing flowering plant native to rocky and coastal areas. It is known for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically blue-green and form a dense mat on the ground. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
