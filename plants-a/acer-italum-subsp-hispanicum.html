                <h1>Acer italum subsp. hispanicum</h1>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin and a deep green color during the growing season. In autumn, the foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange, adding ornamental value to the landscape.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for garden cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a vibrant green color during the growing season, turning yellow to orange in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in rocky or sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Spain and parts of Portugal. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra de Cazorla and Sierra de las Nieves regions.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in rocky, sunny slopes and open woodlands, often growing in calcareous soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle of this species involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum is a native tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil stability and promoting a diverse ecosystem. Its presence also aids in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum is a lesser-known species of maple native to the Iberian Peninsula, valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor traditional uses in local herbal remedies.</p>
<p>In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, though it lacks major commercial value. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in regional landscapes and may be appreciated for its aesthetic value in horticulture.</p>
<p>Its role in conservation efforts highlights its importance in maintaining native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities. Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Emerald Queen', which are known for their vibrant foliage colors.</p>
<p>Hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, have been developed to enhance leaf color and growth habits. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely used in ornamental horticulture for their striking autumn displays and compact growth forms.</p>
