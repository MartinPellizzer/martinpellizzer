                    <h1>Atraphaxis canescens</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis canescens, commonly known as the desert mat grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis canescens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in harsh desert environments.</p>
