<p>Acer davidii var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance, especially when young. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and autumn color.</p>
