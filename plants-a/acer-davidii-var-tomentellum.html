                <h1>Acer davidii var. tomentellum</h1>
<p>Acer davidii var. tomentellum, commonly known as the tomentellum maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and hairy, grayish-green leaves that turn yellow to orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. tomentellum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length; they are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in upright panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. tomentellum is a rare variant of the David's maple, native to the mountainous regions of western China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, largely due to habitat fragmentation and human activity. It thrives in cool, moist environments with rich, well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests. This species is usually found at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from deforestation and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. tomentellum is a slow-growing, ornamental maple known for its distinctive silver-green foliage and compact form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings taken in summer or through seed sown in autumn, though the latter has a lower success rate. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil with consistent moisture. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions, making it a good companion for plants like lavender or heather that thrive in similar conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. tomentellum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a variety of organisms in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. tomentellum is a rare and ornamental plant native to China, known for its unique foliage and ecological value.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been studied for potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local wildlife, enhancing ecological stability.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is admired for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture to enhance landscape design.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. tomentellum has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Baillyi' and 'Erectum' being among the most popular for their unique foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally used in hybridization with other maple species, leading to cultivars that exhibit enhanced cold hardiness or more vibrant fall color. These hybrids often combine the ornamental qualities of Acer davidii with the adaptability of other maple varieties. Due to its slow growth and distinctive silver-green leaves, it holds horticultural importance as a specimen tree in smaller gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Its rarity and aesthetic appeal make it a prized addition to specialized collections.</p>
