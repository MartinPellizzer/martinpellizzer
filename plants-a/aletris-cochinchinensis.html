                    <h1>Aletris cochinchinensis</h1>
<p>Aletris cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant typically grows on the roots of other plants, such as orchids, in forest understories. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces tiny, dry fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
