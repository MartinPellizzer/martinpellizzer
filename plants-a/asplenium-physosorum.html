                    <h1>Asplenium physosorum</h1>
<p>Asplenium physosorum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium physosorum is often found in temperate regions and is considered an indicator species for certain microhabitats.</p>
