                <h1>Adicea sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Adicea sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered adicea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and some toxic species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, often hairy stems. Its leaves are typically basal, with a distinctive shape that aids in identification.</p>
<p>Adicea sessiliflora is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea sessiliflora has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea sessiliflora is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandy soils, and along riverbanks in these regions. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in full sun. It is a hardy plant that is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the dry savannas and coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea sessiliflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
