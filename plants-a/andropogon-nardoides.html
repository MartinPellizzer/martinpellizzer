                    <h1>Andropogon nardoides</h1>
<p>Andropogon nardoides, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, feathery leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves emit a subtle, sweet aroma when crushed, which has made it culturally significant to various Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other grasses like switchgrass and bluestem.</p>
