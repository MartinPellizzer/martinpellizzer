                <h1>Adicea verbascifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea verbascifolia, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea verbascifolia has leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a woolly or hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense, showy spikes, composed of small, yellowish-green to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea verbascifolia is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along coastal areas and in dry, sunny habitats. It is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates and thrives in well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Adicea verbascifolia is often seen in open woodlands, scrublands, and along cliffs in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea verbascifolia was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other areas, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, contributing to the alteration of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize its impact on native plant communities.</p>
