<p>Anthurium bajobonitense, commonly known as the Bajobonitense Arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America.</p>

The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
