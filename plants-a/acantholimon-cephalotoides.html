                        <h1>Acantholimon cephalotoides</h1>
<p>Acantholimon cephalotoides, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the cold, arid regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It has hairy, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss and tolerate freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Acantholimon cephalotoides is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar adaptations to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon cephalotoides belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants like carnations and beets, often with distinctive floral structures. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, which includes species with medicinal and ornamental value. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid regions, characterized by their spiny or bristly leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon cephalotoides, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, known for its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon cephalotoides is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Iran.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon cephalotoides was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and is commonly found in Mediterranean-type climates. This plant is adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate periods of drought. It is often seen in open habitats such as coastal bluffs, sand dunes, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental or ecological purposes.</p>
