                        <h1>Acantholimon cephalotoides</h1>
<p>Acantholimon cephalotoides, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the cold, arid regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It has hairy, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss and tolerate freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Acantholimon cephalotoides is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar adaptations to arid environments.</p>
