                <h1>Achyrospermum africanum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum africanum, commonly known as the African blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue-violet flower heads. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum africanum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 3 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are clustered in dense terminal spikes, featuring five petals that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptic seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb water efficiently from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum africanum is primarily native to Cameroon, DR Congo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Togo.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the humid climate and rich soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses in some communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum africanum was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soil and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue or purple flower heads. This species has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems.</p>
