                    <h1>Acidosasa notata</h1>
<p>Acidosasa notata, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a low-growing epiphytic plant native to the moist, shaded environments of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, star-shaped thallus that ranges from yellow to orange in color. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its surface for nutrient absorption from the air and rain. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found on the bark of trees in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of ecological health.</p>
