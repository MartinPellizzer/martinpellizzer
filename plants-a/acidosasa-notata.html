                <h1>Acidosasa notata</h1>
<p>Acidosasa notata, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a low-growing epiphytic plant native to the moist, shaded environments of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, star-shaped thallus that ranges from yellow to orange in color. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its surface for nutrient absorption from the air and rain. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found on the bark of trees in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of ecological health.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidosasa notata has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils by forming associations with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa notata is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in southeastern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa notata was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed ecosystems.</p>
<p>It was distributed primarily in regions with sandy or gravelly soils. The plant thrives in full sun and is often used in restoration projects. Its introduction has helped stabilize soil and reduce erosion in degraded areas.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive itself.</p>
