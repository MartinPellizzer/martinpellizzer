                    <h1>Agave × neokewensis</h1>
<p>Agave × neokewensis, commonly known as the Kew's agave, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Agave americana and Agave attenuata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous white flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is native to Mexico and is cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of agave sap.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, making it a unique and interesting botanical specimen.</p>
