                <h1>Achillea glavennae</h1>
<p>Achillea glavennae, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Achillea glavennae is often used in rock gardens and alpine habitats due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a greyish-blue color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a light green to brownish color, and they grow upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming in early summer and attracting bees for pollination. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across rocky and arid environments, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and rocky outcrops, often in full sun. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Achillea glavennae is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae is a perennial flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow blooms and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea glavennae involves a period of active growth in spring, flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea glavennae supports biodiversity by creating a habitat for various small organisms in its surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae is a perennial flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions.</p>
<p>It also has potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry due to its bioactive compounds. In culinary contexts, it may be used as a spice or flavoring agent in certain regional cuisines. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some areas, representing resilience and healing.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic uses are less documented compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Avalanche' and 'Moonshine,' which are known for their dense, fluffy flower heads and vibrant coloration. While there are no widely recognized hybrids specifically bred for Achillea glavennae, it is often cross-bred with other yarrow species to create new varieties with enhanced traits. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their drought tolerance, low maintenance requirements, and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Their use in gardens and landscapes highlights their role in both aesthetic and ecological gardening practices.</p>
