                <h1>Achillea glavennae</h1>
<p>Achillea glavennae, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea glavennae is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody with a grayish-brown color, growing from the base to a height of about 30 cm. The flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in parts of Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in rocky soils and open slopes. This plant is typically found in environments with high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil, often in meadows and grasslands. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea glavennae is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, flat-topped yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps during the spring or fall. The growth cycle of Achillea glavennae involves a dormant period in winter, with new growth emerging in early spring and blooming throughout the summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing rocky or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea glavennae also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil structure.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea glavennae is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and use in garden landscapes.</p>
