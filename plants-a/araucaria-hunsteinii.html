<p>Araucaria hunsteinii, commonly known as the Hunstein's Araucaria, is a rare conifer native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a dense, conical crown of needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, reddish covering. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
