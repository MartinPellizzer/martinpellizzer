<p>Aspidium aculeatum subsp.</p>
<p>braunii, commonly known as the Braun's maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests and rocky crevices.</p>
