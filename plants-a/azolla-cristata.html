                    <h1>Azolla cristata</h1>
<p>Azolla cristata, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are divided into small, overlapping segments resembling a cloverleaf. The plant forms dense mats on the water surface, which can help control algae by competing for nutrients. Azolla cristata is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant in aquatic ecosystems and a valuable resource in agricultural applications.</p>
