                        <h1>Acarna cancellata</h1>
<p>Acarna cancellata, commonly known as the spotted arnica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acarna cancellata is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna cancellata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in shaded undergrowth near rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of New Guinea and the western Pacific islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna cancellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic qualities. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species in fragile ecosystems.</p>
