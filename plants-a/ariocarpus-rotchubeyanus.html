                    <h1>Ariocarpus rotchubeyanus</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus rotchubeyanus, commonly known as the "Horned Cactus," is a rare and unique cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular stems that often develop a horn-like appearance as it matures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged structure. It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, with thick, fleshy stems that store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
