<p>Acacia lithgowiae, commonly known as the Lithgow wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spikes. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, a common feature in many Acacia species.</p>
<p>Acacia lithgowiae is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>
