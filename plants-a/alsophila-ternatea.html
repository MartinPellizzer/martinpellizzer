<p>Alsophila ternatea, commonly known as the Ternate cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Ternate in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Alsophila ternatea is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to conservation threats.</p>
