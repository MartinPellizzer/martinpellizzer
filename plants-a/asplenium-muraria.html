<p>Asplenium muraria, commonly known as the wall fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky crevices, walls, and shaded areas, thriving in moist, humid environments. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium muraria is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to colonize difficult growing conditions.</p>
