<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping maple, is a variant of the common maple tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, flowing appearance.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse in the wind. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn, adding to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The weeping maple is relatively hardy but requires well-drained soil and partial shade to thrive.</p>
