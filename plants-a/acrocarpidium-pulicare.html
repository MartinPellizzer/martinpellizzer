                <h1>Acrocarpidium pulicare</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium pulicare, commonly known as the slender moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a low-growing, cushion-like appearance with dense, dark green shoots. The plant produces sporophytes that are typically short and stout, with a capsule that is often reddish-brown in color. Its leaves are narrowly lanceolate and gradually taper to a point, with a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Acrocarpidium pulicare is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium pulicare has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, covered in a rough, dark brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers with a single stamen and pistil, typically in shades of pale yellow, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading just below the soil surface to absorb moisture and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium pulicare is primarily native to the temperate regions of southern Europe, particularly Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous soils and is commonly found in rocky grasslands and open woodlands. This plant is also present in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. It prefers sunny to partially shaded environments and is often associated with Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium pulicare was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as trade and land development.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced species in the region.</p>
