<p>Athyrium filix-femina subsp.</p>
<p>melanolepis, commonly known as the black-stemmed lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
