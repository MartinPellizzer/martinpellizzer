                    <h1>Allium subhirsutum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Allium subhirsutum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs and leaves that are similar to those of garlic chives but with a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period.</p>
