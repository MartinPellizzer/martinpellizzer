                <h1>Acronychia petiolaris</h1>
<p>Acronychia petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf silky oak, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia petiolaris has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin layers. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and clustered in inflorescences; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, woody drupe containing one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia petiolaris is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, including regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical rainforests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often associated with coastal and lowland areas, growing on rocky or sandy soils. It is an evergreen shrub or small tree that plays an important role in its native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions, making it a characteristic species of the Australian rainforest flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia petiolaris was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils where it thrives in partial shade. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand poor soil conditions. It has been introduced to several regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its spread requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
