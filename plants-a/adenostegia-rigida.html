                <h1>Adenostegia rigida</h1>
<p>Adenostegia rigida, commonly known as the rigid stemless dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its succulent stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Adenostegia rigida is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia rigida has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia rigida is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as California, Arizona, and parts of Baja California. This plant typically grows in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with limestone soils and rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia rigida was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant thrives in full sun and is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
