                    <h1>Adenostegia rigida</h1>
<p>Adenostegia rigida, commonly known as the rigid stemless dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its succulent stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Adenostegia rigida is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance.</p>
