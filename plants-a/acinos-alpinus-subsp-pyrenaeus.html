                <h1>Acinos alpinus subsp. pyrenaeus</h1>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaeus, commonly known as the Pyrenean alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered leaves, typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaeus has leaves that are oblanceolate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is erect and branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small, clustered in dense cymes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent achene, with a single seed that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaeus is a rare alpine plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains, primarily found in Spain and France. Its current distribution is limited to specific high-altitude areas within this region.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open alpine meadows and scree slopes. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 1,800 to 2,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from climate change and habitat degradation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaeus is a low-growing alpine plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstock, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring or early summer, and it prefers a cool, humid environment.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during dry periods, but overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with alpine flowers like edelweiss or saxifrage can enhance its growth and create a vibrant alpine garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaeus is a hardy alpine plant that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species in its mountainous habitat. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, showy flowers, contributing to the biodiversity of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in alpine meadows, supporting the growth of other native flora. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its deep root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a range of organisms in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaeus is a rare alpine plant native to the Pyrenees region, known for its ornamental value and ecological role in mountainous habitats. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may be appreciated in horticulture for its delicate flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used by local communities for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. It also holds cultural significance as a symbol of the rugged beauty and biodiversity of the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution makes it important for conservation efforts and ecological research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaeus has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Albus' and 'Rubicundus', which are known for their striking white and reddish flower colors. While few hybrids have been developed specifically for this subspecies, some crosses with related species have produced plants with enhanced hardiness and bloom characteristics.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in alpine and rock garden settings, making it a desirable choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants. The subspecies is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in naturalistic landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a relatively rare but cherished addition to specialized gardens.</p>
