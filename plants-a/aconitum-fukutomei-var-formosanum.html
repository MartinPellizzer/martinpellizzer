<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spathaceous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive silvery underside.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum fukutomei var. formosanum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a coarse texture and a basal arrangement.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish-brown in color, with a branching pattern that becomes more complex as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a tall, sparsely branched inflorescence, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for nutrient absorption and storage.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum fukutomei var. formosanum is a rare flowering plant native to Taiwan, specifically found in the island's mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few localized areas within the central and southern highlands of Taiwan. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum fukutomei var. formosanum is a striking perennial known for its vibrant blue-purple flowers and tall, elegant stems.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, typically blooming in late summer to early fall after a period of active growth in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports growth, while pruning dead foliage after flowering helps maintain its appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs; companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its garden appeal.</p>
