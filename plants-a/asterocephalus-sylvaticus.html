                    <h1>Asterocephalus sylvaticus</h1>
<p>Asterocephalus sylvaticus, commonly known as the forest starhead, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a deep green color that helps it blend into its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Asterocephalus sylvaticus is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
