                    <h1>Avenula armeniaca</h1>
<p>Avenula armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian oatgrass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
