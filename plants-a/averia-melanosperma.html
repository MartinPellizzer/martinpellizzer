                    <h1>Averia melanosperma</h1>
<p>Averia melanosperma, commonly known as the black-seeded grass, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, dark brown seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Averia melanosperma is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures.</p>
