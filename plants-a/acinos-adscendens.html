                <h1>Acinos adscendens</h1>
<p>Acinos adscendens, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Rocky Mountains and western North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Acinos adscendens plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and talus slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos adscendens has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and often branched, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos adscendens is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is often associated with serpentine soils, which are nutrient-poor and rich in heavy metals.</p>
<p>Acinos adscendens is an important component of native plant communities in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos adscendens was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This plant is known for its fluffy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in areas with sparse vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological niches, though it is not considered invasive in most regions.</p>
