                <h1>Acosta triniifolia</h1>
<p>Acosta triniifolia, commonly known as the Three-leafed Acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Acosta triniifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta triniifolia has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in inflorescences, consisting of five petals and five sepals, and bloom from April to June, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta triniifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, lowland environments, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. It is particularly adapted to the warm and moist climate of the Amazon Basin and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Caribbean as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta triniifolia was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
