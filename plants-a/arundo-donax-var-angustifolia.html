                    <h1>Arundo donax var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Arundo donax var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf giant reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Arundo donax. This variety grows in dense stands, often reaching heights of up to 6 meters. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both an ecological pioneer and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
