                <h1>Acer ovczinnikovii</h1>
<p>Acer ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Ovczinnikov's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to orange foliage, which becomes particularly vibrant in the fall. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ovczinnikovii has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven shallow lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is relatively slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with greenish-yellow petals and stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully emerge, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light, allowing them to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ovczinnikovii is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Gansu.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it thrives in temperate forests. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shady, humid environments. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer ovczinnikovii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ovczinnikovii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth characteristics.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with grasses or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ovczinnikovii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and supporting other plant life. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer ovczinnikovii contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ovczinnikovii is a rare and ornamental tree native to China, known for its striking red autumn foliage and unique leaf shapes, making it a valuable plant in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its aesthetic appeal contributes to the ornamental plant trade, supporting local economies in regions where it is cultivated. In traditional Chinese medicine, it has been studied for potential health benefits, though research is limited. The tree holds cultural significance in its native habitat, symbolizing resilience and beauty in natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation also highlights its importance in environmental applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ovczinnikovii has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson Star' and 'Orange Glow', which are prized for their striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and broader color ranges. Horticulturally, Acer ovczinnikovii is valued for its unique leaf patterns and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of ornamental maples in modern landscaping.</p>
