                <h1>Acrolophus diffusus</h1>
<p>Acrolophus diffusus, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically small and pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems.</p>
<p>Acrolophus diffusus is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert or coastal habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophus diffusus has narrow, elongated leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and a tubular shape, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by storing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus diffusus is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open fields, and forest edges. This species thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. It is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for certain insect species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus diffusus was mainly introduced to new areas through human activities such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with suitable climatic conditions, particularly in tropical and subtropical zones. The plant's spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and its adaptability to various soil types. It is often found in agricultural areas and along roadsides, where it can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it has become a concern in several regions where it has displaced local flora.</p>
