                    <h1>Asplenium normale var. grandidentatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium normale var. grandidentatum, commonly known as the large-toothed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its larger, more pronounced teeth along the leaf margins compared to the typical form of A. normale.</p>
