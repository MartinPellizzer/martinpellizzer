<p>Aeluropus laevis, commonly known as the smooth flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in saline or alkaline soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats.</p>
<p>Aeluropus laevis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus laevis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows in dense,丛生 clusters, with a light green to yellowish color.
