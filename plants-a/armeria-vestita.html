<p>Armeria vestita, commonly known as the silver tufted sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Armeria vestita is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
