<p>Avellinia warionis, commonly known as the Warionis hazel, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a woody husk, similar to other hazel species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
