                <h1>Aconitum hortense</h1>
<p>Aconitum hortense, commonly known as the garden aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a tall, upright stem with palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum hortense has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
