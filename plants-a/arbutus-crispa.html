                    <h1>Arbutus crispa</h1>
<p>Arbutus crispa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Arbutus crispa plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
