                            <h1>Ajuga Turkestanica</h1>
<p>Ajuga turkestanica is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is known for its dense, carpet-like foliage and clusters of delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. This plant thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Ajuga turkestanica is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and support local pollinators.</p>
