<p>Asplenium appendiculatum subsp.</p>
<p>maritimum, commonly known as the coastal spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a compact growth habit with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in small groups called sori. It is often found in rocky crevices or on the soil surface in coastal areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to maritime climates and is relatively resilient to salt spray.</p>
