                    <h1>Anthotroche</h1>
<p>Anthotroche, commonly known as the "white spider orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Africa, including South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous areas. The plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Anthotroche species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks, and they rely on specific environmental conditions for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, several species within this genus are at risk of extinction.</p>
