                <h1>Acianthera atroglossa</h1>
<p>Acianthera atroglossa, commonly known as the black-tongued orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark, elongated labellum, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a distinct, intricate structure typical of orchids.</p>
<p>Acianthera atroglossa is a terrestrial orchid that requires specific humidity and light conditions for successful cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera atroglossa has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring violet petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera atroglossa is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the coastal regions of the southeastern part of Brazil. It thrives in humid tropical environments, often growing in dense forests or near riverbanks. The plant is known for its unique dark red to purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is a rare and specialized orchid that is typically found in specific microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera atroglossa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate to high humidity levels. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned agricultural lands. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities like horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
