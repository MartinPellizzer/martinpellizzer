                    <h1>Acer saira</h1>
<p>Acer saira, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters and has a rounded, compact form. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal.</p>
<p>Acer saira is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
