                <h1>Adenia mossambicensis</h1>
<p>Adenia mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique adenium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>However, it requires well-draining soil and protection from frost to thrive.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia mossambicensis has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated edge, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that has a slightly woody texture and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are large, yellowish-green with red stamens, arranged in clusters, blooming during the warm season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia mossambicensis is primarily native to Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and central regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the tropical climate of Mozambique.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia mossambicensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is ample sunlight and moderate temperatures. This plant is often found in coastal areas and near water bodies, where it benefits from the moist air. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can tolerate some degree of drought.</p>
