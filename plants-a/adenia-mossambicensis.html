                    <h1>Adenia mossambicensis</h1>
<p>Adenia mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique adenium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>However, it requires well-draining soil and protection from frost to thrive.</p>
