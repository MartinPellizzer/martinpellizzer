                    <h1>Arenaria brotheriana</h1>
<p>Arenaria brotheriana, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions make it well adapted to its arid and cold habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
