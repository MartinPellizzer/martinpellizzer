<p>Arabis holboellii var. fendleri, commonly known as the Desert Sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
