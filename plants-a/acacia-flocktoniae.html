<p>Acacia flocktoniae, commonly known as the Flockton's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for traditional uses.</p>
<p>Acacia flocktoniae is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
