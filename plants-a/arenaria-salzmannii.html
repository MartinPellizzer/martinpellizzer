<p>Arenaria salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant features tiny, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arenaria salzmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
