                <h1>Adenocarpus complicatus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus is primarily native to Algeria, France, Greece, Italy, Lebanon-Syria, Madeira, Morocco, Portugal, Sicilia, Spain, and Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in Mediterranean regions, where it thrives in dry, rocky, or coastal environments. It is well adapted to the warm, sunny climates typical of these areas. The species is often seen growing in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its historical presence in these specific geographic locations across Europe and North Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus was mainly introduced to Uruguay and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a species that has been deliberately or accidentally brought to these regions, likely for ornamental or agricultural purposes. The introduction has led to its establishment in local ecosystems, sometimes resulting in ecological impacts. Its distribution in these areas highlights the role of human activity in plant dispersal.</p>
<p>Monitoring its spread is important to assess its potential effects on native flora and fauna.</p>
