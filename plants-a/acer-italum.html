                    <h1>Acer italum</h1>
<p>Acer italum, commonly known as the Italian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin and a bright green upper surface.</p>
<p>Acer italum prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
