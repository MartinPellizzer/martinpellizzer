                        <h1>Acantholimon alaicum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon alaicum, commonly known as the Alpine thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
