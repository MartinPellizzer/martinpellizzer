<p>Aylostera fiebrigii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>Aylostera fiebrigii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
