                    <h1>Andropogon scoparius var. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Andropogon scoparius var. glaucescens, commonly known as blue bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands and prairie habitats, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, beige to brown flowers. It is characterized by its glaucous (waxy, bluish) appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
