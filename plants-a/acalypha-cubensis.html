                        <h1>Acalypha cubensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha cubensis, commonly known as Cuban glorybower, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of clusters of small, tubular flowers surrounded by vibrant, bract-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often a deep red or purple, adding visual interest to gardens.</p>
<p>Acalypha cubensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha cubensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a true stem, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and temperate species, often with specialized floral structures. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and some toxic properties. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha cubensis, a specific type of Acalypha native to Cuba, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cubensis is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found throughout the island, particularly in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy soils. It is commonly seen in urban and rural settings across various regions of Cuba.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of the Cuban archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cubensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across the Caribbean, parts of Central America, and the southern United States. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its establishment in some non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
