                    <h1>Austrostipa</h1>
<p>Austrostipa, commonly known as the Australian needlegrass, is a genus of grasses native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>These plants are typically perennial and form dense tussocks, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. They have narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Austrostipa species are characterized by their slender, often branched inflorescences and small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
