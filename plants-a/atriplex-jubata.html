<p>Atriplex jubata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Atriplex jubata is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important plant in ecological restoration and soil stabilization efforts.</p>
