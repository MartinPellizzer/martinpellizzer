                <h1>Achneria mucronata</h1>
<p>Achneria mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, hair-like structures that release an irritating sap when touched. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense clusters, and it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria mucronata has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, displaying a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and upright, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a greenish-brown color, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria mucronata is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and humid tropical environments. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures throughout the year. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the Amazon Basin and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria mucronata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been documented in areas such as Oregon and Washington, where it has established itself in moist, forested environments. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is often found along stream banks and in disturbed soils, spreading through both seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
