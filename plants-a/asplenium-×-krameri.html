                    <h1>Asplenium × krameri</h1>
<p>Asplenium × krameri, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × krameri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
