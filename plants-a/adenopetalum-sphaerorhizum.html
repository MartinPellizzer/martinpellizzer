                <h1>Adenopetalum sphaerorhizum</h1>
<p>Adenopetalum sphaerorhizum, commonly known as the globe-root or globular root plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded tuberous roots and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its unique root structure and ornamental flowers make it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum sphaerorhizum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum sphaerorhizum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, and parts of Sonora. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with desert environments. It is particularly common in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to arid and semi-arid regions within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum sphaerorhizum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in parts of the United States and Europe. The plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its introduction has been associated with horticultural interest rather than ecological invasion.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside of cultivated areas remains limited.</p>
