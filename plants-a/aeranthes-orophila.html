                    <h1>Aeranthes orophila</h1>
<p>Aeranthes orophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrains where competition from other plants is minimal. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aeranthes orophila is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat destruction.</p>
