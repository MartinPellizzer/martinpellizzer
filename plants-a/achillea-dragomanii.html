                <h1>Achillea dragomanii</h1>
<p>Achillea dragomanii, commonly known as the Balkan yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its foliage consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Achillea dragomanii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea dragomanii has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a woolly texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is clump-forming. Its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets in a flat, yellowish disk, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dragomanii is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkan Peninsula, particularly in parts of Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>It is currently found in scattered locations across its native range, with limited populations in specific alpine and subalpine areas. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and forest edges. It typically grows at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea dragomanii is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea dragomanii is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions, and it pairs well with other garden plants like lavender or yarrow for a cohesive look.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea dragomanii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both floral resources and cover. This plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the environment by promoting soil moisture retention and reducing runoff.</p>
