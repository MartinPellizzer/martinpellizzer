                    <h1>Antimima limbata</h1>
<p>Antimima limbata, commonly known as the red-flowered lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the lichen family, forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange coloration, which is due to the presence of specific pigments in the algal component. The plant grows on rocky surfaces or tree bark, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the interwoven fungal and algal components.</p>
<p>Antimima limbata is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
