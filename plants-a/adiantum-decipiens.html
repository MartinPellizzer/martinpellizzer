                <h1>Adiantum decipiens</h1>
<p>Adiantum decipiens, commonly known as the false maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the true maidenhair fern, Adiantum capillus-veneris. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum decipiens has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, and typically measure 20-30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green and maintain their color throughout the growing season. The plant has a slender, creeping stem that grows along the ground, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and does not have a distinct blooming period or pollination method.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum decipiens is primarily native to the Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is often seen growing on cliffs or in moist soil near water sources.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution includes parts of Indonesia and Malaysia, where it adapts well to the local climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum decipiens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states including Washington, Oregon, and California. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, including garden cultivation and accidental spread.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in natural habitats.</p>
