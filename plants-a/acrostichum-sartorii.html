                <h1>Acrostichum sartorii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sartorii, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that form a dense, basket-like structure, which provides shelter for small animals and insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green and may have a slight variegation, adding to the plant's ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sartorii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a broad, feather-like shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sartorii is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and is often associated with tropical rainforests. Its distribution extends to parts of the Caribbean as well.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the warm and wet conditions typical of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sartorii was mainly introduced to urban and industrial areas where its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common sight.</p>
<p>It is often found along roadsides, construction sites, and abandoned lots due to its adaptability to harsh environments. This plant has become an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its spread is facilitated by its prolific seed production and ability to colonize disturbed habitats quickly.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control projects due to its dense growth habit.</p>
