<p>Alopecurus geniculatus f. natans, commonly known as water meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat preferences.</p>
<p>This fern-like grass typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often float on the water surface, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
