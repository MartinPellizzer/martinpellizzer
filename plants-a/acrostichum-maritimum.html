                <h1>Acrostichum maritimum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum maritimum, commonly known as the salt marsh grass or sea grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help stabilize soil in marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acrostichum maritimum plays a vital role in coastal ecology by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum maritimum has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a bipinnate pattern, with each leaf measuring up to 1 meter in length and displaying a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat fibrous, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dark blue drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed primarily by water and birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to anchor itself in sandy or coastal soils and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum maritimum is primarily native to coastal regions of the southern United States, including Florida, the Gulf Coast, and parts of Texas.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in tidal marshes and mangrove swamps. This plant is well adapted to wet, saline soils and can tolerate periodic flooding. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southeastern coastal areas of North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum maritimum was mainly introduced to coastal areas for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tidal zones and along the shores of estuaries and bays. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects. Its dense growth habit provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has also raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native plant communities.</p>
