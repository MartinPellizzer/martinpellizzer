<p>Acrostichum maritimum, commonly known as the salt marsh grass or sea grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help stabilize soil in marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acrostichum maritimum plays a vital role in coastal ecology by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various species.</p>
