                        <h1>Acacia catechu var. sundra</h1>
<p>Acacia catechu var. sundra, commonly known as the Indian blackwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are trifoliate at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for tanning leather due to their high tannin content.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in various crafts and construction.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu var. sundra is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This variant of Acacia catechu thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution extends across parts of the Indian subcontinent and the Malay Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu var. sundra was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This species is often cultivated for its timber and tannin-rich bark, which has traditional uses in medicine and industry. Its introduction has also contributed to ecological changes in native habitats due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it is important to manage its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
