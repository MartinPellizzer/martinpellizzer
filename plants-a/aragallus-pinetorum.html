<p>Aragallus pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the trunks or branches of pine trees. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
