<p>Arctostaphylos crustacea subsp.</p>
<p>eastwoodiana, commonly known as Eastwood's manzanita, is a shrub native to California, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and woody stems. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to other manzanita species.</p>
