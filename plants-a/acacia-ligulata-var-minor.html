                        <h1>Acacia ligulata var. minor</h1>
<p>Acacia ligulata var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that appear in winter. The plant produces seed pods that mature into a hard, woody structure. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ligulata var. minor is primarily native to southern Australia, including regions in Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ligulata var. minor was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and stabilize degraded lands in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand harsh climates. This plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility over time. Its introduction has helped restore vegetation in areas affected by desertification.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target environments.</p>
