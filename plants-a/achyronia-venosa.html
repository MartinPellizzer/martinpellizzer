                <h1>Achyronia venosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive purple or reddish tint at the base.</p>
<p>Achyronia venosa is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia venosa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are usually light green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a pale green bark that becomes rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia venosa is primarily native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with humid lowland areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia venosa was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate standing water and poor soil conditions, which contributes to its success in these habitats. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
