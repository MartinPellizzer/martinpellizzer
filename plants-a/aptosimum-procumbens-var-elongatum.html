                    <h1>Aptosimum procumbens var. elongatum</h1>
<p>Aptosimum procumbens var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated aptosimum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
