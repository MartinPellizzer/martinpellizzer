                    <h1>Asplenium fugax</h1>
<p>Asplenium fugax, commonly known as the temporary fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Asplenium fugax thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ephemeral nature, with fronds often dying back quickly after spore release, contributes to its common name.</p>
