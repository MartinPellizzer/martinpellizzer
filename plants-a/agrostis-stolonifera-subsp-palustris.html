<p>Agrostis stolonifera subsp.</p>
<p>palustris, commonly known as swamp bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a powdery bloom.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and streams. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
