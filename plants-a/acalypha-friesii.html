                <h1>Acalypha friesii</h1>
<p>Acalypha friesii, commonly known as the silverleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-green leaves that have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by three-winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Acalypha friesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha friesii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is typically branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pink or reddish bracts, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha friesii is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar, where it is found in specific regions of the eastern rainforests.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, although it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens outside its native range. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically found in lowland to mid-elevation forests. The plant is usually found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acalypha friesii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha friesii is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's variegation. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid environments and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, requiring watering when the top inch of soil dries out. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every few weeks promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage bushier growth.
