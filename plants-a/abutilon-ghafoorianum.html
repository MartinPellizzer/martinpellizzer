<p>Abutilon ghafoorianum, commonly known as the Persian velvetleaf, is a shrub native to Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, dry seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon ghafoorianum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface and a dull green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The flowers are bell-shaped, with five petals and a yellowish-green color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
