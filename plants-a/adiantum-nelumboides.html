                <h1>Adiantum nelumboides</h1>
<p>Adiantum nelumboides, commonly known as the water fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and ponds, where it can receive ample moisture. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant in soft, muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum nelumboides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum nelumboides has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a smooth margin and a delicate, lace-like texture. The plant has a short, creeping stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows close to the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and appear in late spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread along the forest floor.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nelumboides is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This fern species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing along streams or in forest understories. The plant is known for its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble small umbrellas.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions within southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nelumboides was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. The plant has spread across several states, particularly in the eastern and southeastern regions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
