                <h1>Acriopsis annamica</h1>
<p>Acriopsis annamica, commonly known as the Annam bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Acriopsis annamica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis annamica has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a creeping growth pattern that allows it to spread along the ground. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis annamica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions with moist, well-drained soils. This plant typically grows in lowland areas and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is an herbaceous plant that thrives in humid climates with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis annamica was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often associated with human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils, making it common in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is typically found in disturbed environments like roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a potential invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
