                    <h1>Atriplex patula var. muricata</h1>
<p>Atriplex patula var. muricata, commonly known as the roughleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in small, waxy bumps, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in harsh, windy conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
