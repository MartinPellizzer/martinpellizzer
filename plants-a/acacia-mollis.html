                    <h1>Acacia mollis</h1>
<p>Acacia mollis, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and feathery, finely divided leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in globular inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Acacia mollis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
