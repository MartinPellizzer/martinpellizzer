                    <h1>Aira bachitii</h1>
<p>Aira bachitii, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Aira bachitii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
