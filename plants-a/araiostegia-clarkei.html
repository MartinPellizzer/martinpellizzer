<p>Araiostegia clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Araiostegia clarkei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
