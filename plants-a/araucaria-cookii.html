                    <h1>Araucaria cookii</h1>
<p>Araucaria cookii, commonly known as the Cook's Araucaria, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown of needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril, which is attractive to birds. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is classified as critically endangered.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it a valuable subject for botanical and ecological study.</p>
