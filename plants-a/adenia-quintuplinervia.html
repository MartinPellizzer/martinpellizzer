                <h1>Adenia quintuplinervia</h1>
<p>Adenia quintuplinervia, commonly known as the five-veined adenium, is a striking shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, often woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves with five distinct veins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Adenia quintuplinervia is also noted for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia quintuplinervia has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to black in color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five petals and a yellowish-white color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia quintuplinervia is primarily native to the tropical regions of eastern and southeastern Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and parts of Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in humid, lowland forest environments, often growing along stream banks or in shaded undergrowth. It is commonly found in areas with rich, moist soil and a warm climate.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia quintuplinervia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in partial to full sun. This plant is typically introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering structure. It has been reported in several countries, including parts of Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
