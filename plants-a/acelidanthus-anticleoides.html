<p>Acelidanthus anticleoides, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and a single, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed structure.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
