                    <h1>Aspidium erosum</h1>
<p>Aspidium erosum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate pinnae with serrated edges. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
