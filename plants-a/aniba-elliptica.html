<p>Aniba elliptica, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It features smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
