                    <h1>Agrostis transmorrisonensis</h1>
<p>Agrostis transmorrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's bentgrass, is a rare grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
