                        <h1>Acacia cochlearis</h1>
<p>Acacia cochlearis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular heads, which are followed by seed pods that are curved and resemble a cochlea, hence its scientific name. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acacia cochlearis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife.</p>
