<p>Avena beguinotiana, commonly known as the beguinotian oat, is a rare and unique species of grass native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves and its small, spike-like inflorescence. The plant exhibits a peculiar growth habit, with its leaves curling tightly around the stem, forming a compact, spiral structure. It thrives in the arid and rocky environment of Socotra, adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific interest.</p>
