<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has long, strap-like leaves that help it thrive in moist environments. Its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season, making it a notable species in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Achneria ampla is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria ampla has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and exhibits a light green to reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is typically upright and branching.
