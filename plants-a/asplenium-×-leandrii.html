                    <h1>Asplenium × leandrii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × leandrii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × leandrii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
