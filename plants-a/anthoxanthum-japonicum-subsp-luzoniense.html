<p>Anthoxanthum japonicum subsp.</p>
<p>luzoniense, commonly known as Luzon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
