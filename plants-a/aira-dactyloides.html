<p>Aira dactyloides, commonly known as buffalograss, is a low-growing, drought-tolerant grass native to the central and western United States.</p>
<p>It has fine, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control and landscaping in dry regions. It reproduces primarily through tillering and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Buffalograss is also known for its ability to thrive with minimal water and fertilizer input.</p>
