                    <h1>Aconitum talassicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum talassicum, commonly known as sea aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the sea shore, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features dark green, palmately lobed leaves and produces striking blue to purple sparsely branched flowers in late summer. Its toxic alkaloids make it a dangerous plant, though it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Aconitum talassicum is adapted to maritime climates and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
