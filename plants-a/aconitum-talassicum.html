                <h1>Aconitum talassicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum talassicum, commonly known as sea aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the sea shore, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features dark green, palmately lobed leaves and produces striking blue to purple sparsely branched flowers in late summer. Its toxic alkaloids make it a dangerous plant, though it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Aconitum talassicum is adapted to maritime climates and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum talassicum has leaves that are palmately compound, with 5-9 lance-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern, measuring up to 15 cm in diameter, and displaying a dark green color with a fuzzy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, reaching up to 2 meters in height, with a smooth, dark purple to reddish-brown bark that is slightly hairy. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense panicle inflorescences, consisting of showy spurred petals, and bloom from late summer to early autumn, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in harsh, coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum talassicum is primarily native to Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, Tadzhikistan, Uzbekistan, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is commonly associated with rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations. The species is well adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic areas within Central Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum talassicum was mainly introduced to coastal and maritime environments due to its adaptability to salty and windy conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and rocky shores. This plant has been reported in several countries along the Atlantic coast, including the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as coastal development and the accidental transport of seeds via maritime traffic.</p>
<p>Despite its hardy nature, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has established itself.</p>
