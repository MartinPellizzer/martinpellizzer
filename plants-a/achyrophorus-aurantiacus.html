                <h1>Achyrophorus aurantiacus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus aurantiacus, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along its branching stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus aurantiacus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and pale underneath, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of a fibrous network that anchors the plant and absorbs nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus aurantiacus is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the southeastern regions including parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. It thrives in areas with well-drained, loamy soil and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. The species is also occasionally found in the Appalachian region, extending into Tennessee and Virginia.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus aurantiacus was mainly introduced to control weed competition in agricultural fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, in pastures, and in cultivated lands. This plant has been reported in several states across the United States, including Texas, California, and Florida. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an effective but sometimes invasive species.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced plants in similar habitats.</p>
