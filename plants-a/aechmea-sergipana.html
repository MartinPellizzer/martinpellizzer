                <h1>Aechmea sergipana</h1>
<p>Aechmea sergipana, commonly known as the Sergipe pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of long, narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, showy flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Aechmea sergipana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea sergipana has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically narrow, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, thick base that supports the rosette, with a rough, fibrous texture and a pale greenish-brown color. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful, showy bract, with flowers that are small, white or pale green, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its native habitat, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
