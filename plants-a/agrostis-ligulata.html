                    <h1>Agrostis ligulata</h1>
<p>Agrostis ligulata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Agrostis ligulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
