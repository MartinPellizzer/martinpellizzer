                    <h1>Apatostelis umbelliformis</h1>
<p>Apatostelis umbelliformis, commonly known as the umbrella-shaped fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that form a compact, umbrella-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid conditions.</p>
