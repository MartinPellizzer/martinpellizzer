                    <h1>Arisaema heterocephalum</h1>
<p>Arisaema heterocephalum, commonly known as the heterocephalous arisaema, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-shaped inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the spadix, a feature typical of many arum species. Its foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Arisaema heterocephalum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
