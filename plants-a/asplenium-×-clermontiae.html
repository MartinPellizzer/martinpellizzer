                    <h1>Asplenium × clermontiae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × clermontiae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × clermontiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
