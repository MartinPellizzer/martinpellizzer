<p>Astragalus adsurgens subsp.</p>
<p>robustior, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in dry grasslands and is valued for its ecological and potential medicinal properties.</p>
