                    <h1>Agrostis hyperborea</h1>
<p>Agrostis hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold, moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
