                <h1>Adiantum hispidulum</h1>
<p>Adiantum hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture on the underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>Adiantum hispidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum hispidulum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, have a slender and wiry structure, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and grows upright, with a rough texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hispidulum is primarily native to Caroline Is., Chatham Is., China South-Central, China Southeast, Comoros, Cook Is., Ethiopia, Fiji, India, Jawa, Kenya, Kermadec Is., Lesser Sunda Is., Madagascar, Malawi, Malaya, Mozambique, New Caledonia, New South Wales, New Zealand North, Norfolk Is., Northern Provinces, Northern Territory, Philippines, Queensland, Society Is., South Australia, Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Tonga, Tuamotu, Tubuai Is., Vanuatu, Victoria, Western Australia, and Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>It is commonly encountered in both tropical and temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hispidulum was mainly introduced to Alabama, Azores, Canary Is., Cape Provinces, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, KwaZulu-Natal, Louisiana, Madeira.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in moist, shaded environments across these regions. It has been reported growing in a variety of habitats, including forests and rocky areas. The introduction of Adiantum hispidulum has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Its spread highlights the need for careful monitoring in non-native regions.</p>
