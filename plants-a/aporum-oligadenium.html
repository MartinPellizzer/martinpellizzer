                    <h1>Aporum oligadenium</h1>
<p>Aporum oligadenium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and its unique, ghostly white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a fascinating example of adaptive evolution. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
