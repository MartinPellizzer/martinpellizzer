                <h1>Acronia nossax</h1>
<p>Acronia nossax, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, peppers, and other nightshade plants. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, yellow berries that are edible but can be toxic in large quantities. Acronia nossax is characterized by its dense foliage and adaptability to humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia nossax has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slight roughness as it ages. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow in color, with a tubular structure, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia nossax is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome in southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, particularly in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with cliffs and shaded rock faces near the coastline.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia nossax was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, quarries, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of disturbed sites. This plant is often found in Mediterranean climates, where it has established itself as an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal contribute to its successful colonization of new areas.</p>
<p>However, it can outcompete native vegetation, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
