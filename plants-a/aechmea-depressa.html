                <h1>Aechmea depressa</h1>
<p>Aechmea depressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Aechmea depressa is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea depressa has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and dark green with a waxy coating, arranged in a compact circle around the central rosette.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, slightly fibrous bark that grows upward from the base of the plant. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the late summer to early fall, and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals after splitting open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, which is typical for epiphytic bromeliads.</p>
