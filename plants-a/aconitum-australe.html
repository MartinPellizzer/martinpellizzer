                <h1>Aconitum australe</h1>
<p>Aconitum australe, commonly known as the Australian aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are typically hairy and upright. Aconitum australe contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum australe has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures, growing upright and branching towards the top. Its flowers are blue to violet in color, arranged in dense spikes, with five petals and a distinctive hooded structure, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with a tuft of hair for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum australe is primarily native to southern South America, specifically Argentina, Chile, and parts of Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in mountainous areas and is often associated with grasslands and shrublands. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern hemisphere within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum australe was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue or purple flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. The plant is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
