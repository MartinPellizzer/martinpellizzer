                <h1>Acer wilsonii var. serrulatum</h1>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with finely serrated margins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. serrulatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface that turns reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the flowers are inconspicuous and not showy. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread effectively.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. serrulatum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now also found in cultivation in botanical gardens and arboreta around the world. This plant thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within mixed forests. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer wilsonii var. serrulatum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. serrulatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. serrulatum is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing overall ecological stability. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, particularly on slopes and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. serrulatum is a lesser-known species of maple with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas in some regions.</p>
<p>It has been explored for its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific research is still limited. While not widely used in industry, its wood may have some local economic value in small-scale crafts or furniture. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions of China, where it is appreciated for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain niche, primarily in traditional and ecological contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. serrulatum has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Tiger Tree', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage and unique bark patterns.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer ginnala, to produce cultivars like 'Autumnalis' and 'Emerald Queen', which exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and more consistent coloration, making them popular choices for urban and garden landscapes. The species and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, contributing to the diversity of landscape trees in temperate regions.</p>
