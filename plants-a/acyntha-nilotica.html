                <h1>Acyntha nilotica</h1>
<p>Acyntha nilotica, commonly known as the Egyptian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom in the evening. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains several small, black seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha nilotica has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually green with a slight pubescent surface, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow to white, with five petals and a tubular throat, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha nilotica is primarily native to sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in regions such as Sudan, South Sudan, and parts of the Sahel.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found in agricultural areas as well. It is also present in some parts of the Middle East and southern Arabia.</p>
<p>Acyntha nilotica plays a role in traditional medicine and is sometimes used for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha nilotica was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant has adapted well to these environments due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions and ability to spread through seeds. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it is not currently classified as a major invasive species in most regions.</p>
