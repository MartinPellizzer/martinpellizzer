<p>Acyntha nilotica, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial herb native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early autumn. Its milky sap, containing latex, is a distinguishing feature and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Acyntha nilotica is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in semi-arid to humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha nilotica has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, and has a smooth, pale green to brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha nilotica is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of the Middle East and India, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or along riverbanks. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acyntha nilotica is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acyntha nilotica is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings offering a faster and more reliable method. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage blooms are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
