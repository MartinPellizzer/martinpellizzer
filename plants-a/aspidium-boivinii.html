<p>Aspidium boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium boivinii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
