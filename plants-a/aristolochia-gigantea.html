                    <h1>Aristolochia gigantea</h1>
<p>Aristolochia gigantea, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread vigorously in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic compounds and is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
