                <h1>Anathallis bertoniensis</h1>
<p>Anathallis bertoniensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique, almost translucent appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Anathallis bertoniensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
