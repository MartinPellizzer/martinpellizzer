                <h1>Achillea kotschyi subsp. kotschyi</h1>
<p>Achillea kotschyi subsp.</p>
<p>kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea kotschyi subsp.</p>
<p>kotschyi has narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface. The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a smooth, greenish-gray bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, with small seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea kotschyi subsp.</p>
<p>kotschyi is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East, primarily found in Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. Its current distribution is largely restricted to these areas, with some populations extending into parts of Syria.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and steppes, often in well-drained soils. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea kotschyi subsp.</p>
<p>kotschyi is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, known for its distinctive yellow flowers and aromatic foliage. It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing mature clumps, with the best results achieved in early spring or fall. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, blooming in its second year before dying back, though it often reseeds itself for continuous growth.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme enhances its fragrance and deters pests naturally.</p>
