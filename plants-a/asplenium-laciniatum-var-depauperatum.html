                    <h1>Asplenium laciniatum var. depauperatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium laciniatum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the barren spleenwort, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. This variant is distinguished by its reduced foliage compared to the typical form of Asplenium laciniatum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or damp woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
