                <h1>Achyranthes incana</h1>
<p>Achyranthes incana, commonly known as white knotweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits containing single seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is part of the Amaranthaceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes incana has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface and a woolly underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–15 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a pale green to greyish-green color. The stem is erect, branching, and has a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in raceme-like clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to thrive in dry, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes incana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed or cultivated soils. It is widely distributed across the Indian subcontinent and parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes incana was mainly introduced to control erosion and as a forage plant in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been intentionally planted. The plant has adapted well to various climates and soil types, making it a persistent invasive species in some areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its success in new environments.</p>
<p>However, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in certain regions.</p>
