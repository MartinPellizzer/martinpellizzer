                    <h1>Alnus × mayrii</h1>
<p>Alnus × mayrii, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Alnus incana (gray alder) and Alnus glutinosa (European alder).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical cones that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies.</p>
<p>Alnus × mayrii is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
