                    <h1>Agrostophyllum edanoanum</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum edanoanum, commonly known as the Edanoan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It possesses small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Agrostophyllum edanoanum plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing food for wildlife.</p>
