                <h1>Achyronia astroites</h1>
<p>Achyronia astroites, commonly known as the starry achyronia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achyronia astroites is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia astroites has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a slightly hairy texture and a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age.

<p>It is found in the states of Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes. It is often associated with limestone soils and is a component of the understory vegetation in these habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia astroites was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in gardens and naturalized areas. This plant is known for its attractive, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, it can sometimes become invasive if not properly managed.</p>
