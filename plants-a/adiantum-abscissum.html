                <h1>Adiantum abscissum</h1>
<p>Adiantum abscissum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and have a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth.</p>
<p>Adiantum abscissum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum abscissum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are typically green with a silvery-blue hue on the underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark. The plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores released from small, clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum abscissum is primarily found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum abscissum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This fern species is commonly found in humid tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant is well adapted to the diverse microclimates of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for warm, humid conditions with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum abscissum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered non-invasive and poses minimal threat to local ecosystems.</p>
