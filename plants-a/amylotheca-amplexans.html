                    <h1>Amylotheca amplexans</h1>
<p>Amylotheca amplexans, commonly known as the clinging lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, forming a dense, crust-like growth that adheres tightly to its substrate. The plant's thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>Amylotheca amplexans plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
