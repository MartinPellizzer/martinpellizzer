<p>Atriplex lasiantha var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
