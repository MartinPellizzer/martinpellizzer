                    <h1>Asarum fauriei var. stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Asarum fauriei var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping asarum, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, reddish-purple leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spike, which are typically hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats over the soil.</p>
