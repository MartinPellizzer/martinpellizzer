                <h1>Adamanthus polyphyllus</h1>
<p>Adamanthus polyphyllus, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often feather-like in appearance. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>Adamanthus polyphyllus is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in upland forests and open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus polyphyllus has compound, feather-like leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus polyphyllus is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within the understory of dense forests. It is commonly associated with areas of high biodiversity and is often found in rocky or clayey soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus polyphyllus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woods, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have made it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across the region.</p>
