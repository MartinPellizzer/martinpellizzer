<p>Anapeltis serpens, commonly known as the snake plant, is a succulent native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a glossy surface. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers on slender stalks, which are usually white or pale green.</p>
<p>Anapeltis serpens is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
