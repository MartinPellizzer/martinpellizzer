<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Adesmia ruiz-lealii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia ruiz-lealii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light green to brownish color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, rounded seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia ruiz-lealii is primarily native to Argentina South.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southern regions of Argentina, particularly in the Patagonian steppe and surrounding areas. It thrives in dry, open habitats with well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the harsh climate of this region, characterized by low precipitation and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific area, making it a regionally important species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia ruiz-lealii was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climatic conditions, including regions with warm temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is typically found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and urban environments. The plant thrives in full sun and is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in the Americas, particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and natural landscapes.</p>
