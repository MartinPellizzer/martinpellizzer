                <h1>Acianthera odontotepala</h1>
<p>Acianthera odontotepala, commonly known as the toothed-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>Acianthera odontotepala thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera odontotepala has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a dark green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera odontotepala is primarily native to Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Caribbean region, specifically within these three countries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in forested areas. The plant is known for its distinctive floral characteristics and is part of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of the Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera odontotepala was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's ability to spread rapidly has led to its establishment in regions outside its native range. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Monitoring its spread is essential to manage its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
