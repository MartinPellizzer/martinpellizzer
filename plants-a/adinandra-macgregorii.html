                <h1>Adinandra macgregorii</h1>
<p>Adinandra macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's adenium, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and waxy, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-resistant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra macgregorii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside, typically measuring between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra macgregorii is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the lowland and montane forests. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in shaded undergrowth. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the Philippines, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra macgregorii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions like Hawaii and Tahiti.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its adaptability to various soil types. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly seen in urban and agricultural landscapes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native ecosystems, sometimes competing with indigenous species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soils.</p>
