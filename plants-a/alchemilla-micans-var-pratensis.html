                    <h1>Alchemilla micans var. pratensis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla micans var. pratensis, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
