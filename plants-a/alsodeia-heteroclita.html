<p>Alsodeia heteroclita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alsike, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically followed by small, elongated pods containing several seeds. Alsodeia heteroclita is adapted to grow in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
