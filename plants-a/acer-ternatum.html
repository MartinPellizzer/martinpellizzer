                <h1>Acer ternatum</h1>
<p>Acer ternatum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically three- to five-lobed and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ternatum has palmately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn yellow in autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ternatum is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of China and Southeast Asia, where it is cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in mountain valleys. This species typically occurs at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer ternatum is considered vulnerable, though it remains relatively stable in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ternatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer ternatum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer, with fall marking the time for leaf color change and shedding.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, and companion planting with shade-tolerant species can enhance its growth in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ternatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and produces edible berries that are consumed by birds. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex food web. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer ternatum contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>
