<p>Antennaria media subsp.</p>
<p>fusca, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
