                <h1>Aconitum engadinense</h1>
<p>Aconitum engadinense, commonly known as the Engadine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape. The plant features palmately compound leaves with deep lobes, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas. It is notable for containing potent alkaloids, making it toxic to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>This species is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum engadinense has large, compound leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The flowers are blue to purple, forming dense clusters at the top of the plant, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies; they bloom from late summer to early autumn. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>
