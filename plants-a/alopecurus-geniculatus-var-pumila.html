                    <h1>Alopecurus geniculatus var. pumila</h1>
<p>Alopecurus geniculatus var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ground cover in horticulture.</p>
