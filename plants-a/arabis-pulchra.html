<p>Arabis pulchra, commonly known as the showy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to the often barren mountain landscapes.</p>
