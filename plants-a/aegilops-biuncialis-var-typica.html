                    <h1>Aegilops biuncialis var. typica</h1>
<p>Aegilops biuncialis var. typica, commonly known as the two-rowed wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two rows of spikelets, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the evolution of cultivated barley.</p>
