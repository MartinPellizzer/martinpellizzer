                <h1>Adonis annua</h1>
<p>Adonis annua, commonly known as the annual glory of the snow, is an herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis annua has alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and range from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, branching, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its flowers are yellow, with four petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis annua is primarily native to Albania, Algeria, Baleares, Bulgaria, Corse, Cyprus, East Aegean Is., France, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Kriti, Lebanon-Syria, Morocco, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., Palestine, Portugal, Sardegna, Sicilia, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, and Turkey-in-Europe. It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, often growing in open areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste ground.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical conditions. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine and is also known for its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its ability to colonize a variety of habitats across southern and southeastern Europe and parts of the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis annua was mainly introduced to Alabama, Arkansas, Belgium, Czechia-Slovakia, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Louisiana, Missouri, Norway, South European Russia, Sweden, Tennessee, Texas.</p>
<p>It has established populations in these regions, often in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant is considered an invasive species in some of these areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including agriculture and landscaping.</p>
<p>Monitoring and control efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
