                        <h1>Acaena tasmanica</h1>
<p>Acaena tasmanica, commonly known as New Zealand thistle, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red, achene-like fruits that are often covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena tasmanica is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in areas with cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Acaena tasmanica is an important component of native vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
