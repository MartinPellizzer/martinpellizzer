<p>Acaena tasmanica, commonly known as New Zealand thistle, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red, achene-like fruits that are often covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
