                <h1>Acer sempervirens</h1>
<p>Acer sempervirens, commonly known as the European maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10–25 meters and has a broad, spreading crown.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sempervirens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm in length and remain evergreen, providing year-round foliage. The stem is straight and grows upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sempervirens is a species of maple native to the mountains of southern and eastern Europe, including regions such as Italy, Greece, and the Balkans.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and parts of Asia. This plant thrives in temperate climates, often growing in forested areas or along rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Currently, Acer sempervirens is not considered threatened, though its natural habitat faces pressures from deforestation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sempervirens is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region, known for its dense foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in full sun to partial shade and requiring well-drained soil with regular watering during dry periods.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
