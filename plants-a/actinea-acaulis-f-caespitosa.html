                    <h1>Actinea acaulis f. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Actinea acaulis f. caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted coralroot, is a unique fern-like plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant forms dense, compact clusters, giving it its "caespitosa" designation, which means "tufted" or "cush-like.". Its appearance resembles a coral-like structure, hence its common name.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in shaded, moist environments and is notable for its specialized symbiotic relationship with fungi.</p>
