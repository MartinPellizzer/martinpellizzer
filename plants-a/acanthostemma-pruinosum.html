                        <h1>Acanthostemma pruinosum</h1>
<p>Acanthostemma pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky acanthostemma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthostemma pruinosum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, grasslands, and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often seen in the Cape Floristic Region, which is known for its rich biodiversity.</p>
<p>Acanthostemma pruinosum is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthostemma pruinosum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the fynbos biome, particularly in the Western Cape region. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport via contaminated soil or seeds.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
