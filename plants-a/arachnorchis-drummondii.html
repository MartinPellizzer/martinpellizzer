                    <h1>Arachnorchis drummondii</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom during the winter months, adapting to the harsh, dry climate. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to its extreme environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
