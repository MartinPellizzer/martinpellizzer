                <h1>Acer floridanum var. acuminatum</h1>
<p>Acer floridanum var. acuminatum, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, palmately compound leaves. The leaves are usually 5–9 inches long and have a serrated margin, turning bright yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer floridanum var. acuminatum has elliptical to ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a pointed tip and finely serrated edges, typically reaching up to 10 cm in length and 5 cm in width, exhibiting a bright green color during the growing season and turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and the plant grows as a small tree or shrub with an upright growth habit. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during spring, which are primarily wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer floridanum var. acuminatum is a rare, small deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the wetlands and hammocks of the Florida Panhandle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in swamp forests and along the margins of freshwater wetlands. This species grows at low elevations, generally between 0 and 50 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer floridanum var. acuminatum is a unique maple species native to the southeastern United States, known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or softwood cuttings, with seedlings requiring stratification for successful germination. This plant thrives in a growth cycle that includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid spring growth and flowering.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and consistent moisture, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like clover can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer floridanum var. acuminatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by supporting a diverse array of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer floridanum var. acuminatum is a lesser-known species of maple native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its foliage and seeds may have minor roles in local foraging practices. In traditional medicine, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to ecological stability by supporting local biodiversity and soil health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in regional ecosystems and may be appreciated for its ornamental qualities in native plant landscaping.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer floridanum var. acuminatum has several notable cultivars, including 'Coral Beauty' and 'Coral焰', which are prized for their vibrant red foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization with other maple species, leading to the development of unique varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and extended fall color, making them more adaptable to diverse climates. The horticultural importance of this species lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its striking autumn display.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, it remains a valuable addition to both public and private landscapes.</p>
