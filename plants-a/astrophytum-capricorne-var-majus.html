                    <h1>Astrophytum capricorne var. majus</h1>
<p>Astrophytum capricorne var. majus, commonly known as the horned cactus or the crown of thorns, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that resemble horns, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The varietal form, majus, is distinguished by its more pronounced spines and a more robust growth habit compared to other varieties.</p>
