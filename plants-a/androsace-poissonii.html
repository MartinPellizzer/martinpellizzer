<p>Androsace poissonii, commonly known as the Poisson's rock lettuce, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Androsace poissonii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
