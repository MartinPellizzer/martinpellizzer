                    <h1>Astrebla squarrosa</h1>
<p>Astrebla squarrosa, commonly known as the mulga grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in dry open woodlands and plains. The plant has wiry, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and tough, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Astrebla squarrosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for native animals.</p>
