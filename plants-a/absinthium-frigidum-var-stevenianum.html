                        <h1>Absinthium frigidum var. stevenianum</h1>
<p>Absinthium frigidum var. stevenianum, commonly known as frost absinth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium frigidum var. stevenianum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold climates and well-drained soils. This variant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters. It is adapted to harsh conditions and is part of the local flora in these remote areas.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally reported in the Caucasus region, though its distribution is more restricted compared to the main Central Asian range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium frigidum var. stevenianum was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has since become established in various regions, particularly in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is often found in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
