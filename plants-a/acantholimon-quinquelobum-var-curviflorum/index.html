                            <h1>Acantholimon Quinquelobum Var. Curviflorum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon quinquelobum var. curviflorum is a rare and striking plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spiky flower clusters that bloom in late spring. This variety is particularly noted for its curved flower stems, which give it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique plant from environmental threats.</p>
