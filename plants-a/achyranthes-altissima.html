                <h1>Achyranthes altissima</h1>
<p>Achyranthes altissima, commonly known as the tall knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense, terminal clusters called panicles.</p>
<p>Achyranthes altissima is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes altissima has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and somewhat woody with a rough, grayish-brown bark. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes altissima is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed soils. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across Southeast Asia, where it is a common weed in agricultural fields and natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes altissima was mainly introduced to control erosion and as a forage crop in degraded soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lands. The plant spreads through its rhizomes and seeds, which can be dispersed by wind, water, and animals. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it has also been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
