                        <h1>Achillea albertiana</h1>
<p>Achillea albertiana, commonly known as Albert's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>The species is named in honor of Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a British royal, reflecting its historical significance in botanical nomenclature.</p>
