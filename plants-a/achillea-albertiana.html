                <h1>Achillea albertiana</h1>
<p>Achillea albertiana, commonly known as Albert's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>The species is named in honor of Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a British royal, reflecting its historical significance in botanical nomenclature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea albertiana has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a light green to reddish-brown color. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea albertiana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in these regions. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is typically found at high altitudes, ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Achillea albertiana is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is of concern for botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea albertiana is a hardy perennial plant known for its showy, flat-topped yellow flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature clumps in early spring or fall. The growth cycle of Achillea albertiana involves a dormant winter period followed by active growth and flowering in early to mid-summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, rosemary, or other aromatic herbs can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
