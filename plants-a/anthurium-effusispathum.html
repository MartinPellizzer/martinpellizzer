<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety pubescence. The plant produces bright red spathes that enclose its small, spadix-like inflorescence, which contains both male and female flowers. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it often grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Anthurium effusispathum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for its unique foliage and vibrant floral display.</p>
