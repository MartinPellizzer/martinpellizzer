                    <h1>Ajuga pseudoiva var. apetala</h1>
<p>Ajuga pseudoiva var. apetala, commonly known as the barrenleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, though it is noted for lacking petals, giving it its "apetala" designation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it an attractive ground cover for native gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
