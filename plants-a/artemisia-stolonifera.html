                    <h1>Artemisia stolonifera</h1>
<p>Artemisia stolonifera, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Artemisia stolonifera spreads via stolons, allowing it to form dense mats or colonies in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
