<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>tomentellicupula, commonly known as the woolly burr plant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces spherical, hairy fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
