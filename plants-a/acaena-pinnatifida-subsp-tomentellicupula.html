<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>tomentellicupula, commonly known as the woolly burr plant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces spherical, hairy fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>tomentellicupula is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>tomentellicupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often associated with human-modified landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has not significantly impacted native ecosystems.</p>
