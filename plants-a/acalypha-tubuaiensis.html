                        <h1>Acalypha tubuaiensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha tubuaiensis, commonly known as the Island Caper, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive yellowish or reddish coloration. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-white and lack showy petals.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha tubuaiensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of the Amazon rainforest.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha tubuaiensis was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in coastal areas. The distribution is primarily limited to the island of Oahu, where it thrives in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
