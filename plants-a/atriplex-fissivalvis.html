                    <h1>Atriplex fissivalvis</h1>
<p>Atriplex fissivalvis, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it an important species in ecological restoration.</p>
<p>Atriplex fissivalvis also plays a role in preventing soil erosion due to its extensive root system.</p>
