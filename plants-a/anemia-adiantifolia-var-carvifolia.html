                    <h1>Anemia adiantifolia var. carvifolia</h1>
<p>Anemia adiantifolia var. carvifolia, commonly known as the Caraway Fern, is a variant of the Anemia adiantifolia species, which belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role.</p>
