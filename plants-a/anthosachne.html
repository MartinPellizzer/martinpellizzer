                    <h1>Anthosachne</h1>
<p>Anthosachne, commonly known as the false grass or arrowhead grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically perennial and are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. They are native to various regions across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, often growing in moist or wetland habitats. Anthosachne species are usually found in marshy areas, riverbanks, and other damp environments, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them important in ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts.</p>
