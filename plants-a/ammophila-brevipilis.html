                    <h1>Ammophila brevipilis</h1>
<p>Ammophila brevipilis, commonly known as the short-haired marram grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to sandy soils and can stabilize dunes through its extensive root system. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with short, fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Ammophila brevipilis plays a crucial role in preventing coastal erosion and maintaining dune ecosystems.</p>
