                <h1>Acrotrema sylvaticum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema sylvaticum, commonly known as the forest acrotrema, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Acrotrema sylvaticum is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ecological role in supporting insect populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema sylvaticum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the spring, featuring a greenish-white color and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema sylvaticum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in shaded environments, often growing on decaying wood or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. It is an important component of the fungal and plant communities in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of suitable substrates and microclimatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema sylvaticum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. The plant has shown adaptability to various climates, allowing it to spread beyond its native range. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, current data suggests it has not become invasive in most regions.</p>
