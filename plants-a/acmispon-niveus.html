                <h1>Acmispon niveus</h1>
<p>Acmispon niveus, commonly known as white needlepod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces slender, hairy pods that contain tiny, oval seeds. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Acmispon niveus is an annual herb that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon niveus has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are pea-shaped, white with a slight pink tinge, and bloom in early spring; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, rounded seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon niveus is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure. Acmispon niveus is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of these areas, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon niveus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capability, which improves soil fertility. It has been introduced to various regions in the United States, particularly in the western states.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly, posing a risk to native plant communities.</p>
