                    <h1>Ageria retusa</h1>
<p>Ageria retusa, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Ageria retusa thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
