                    <h1>Allosorus auriculatus</h1>
<p>Allosorus auriculatus, commonly known as the ear-shaped liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern with closely packed, overlapping leaves. The leaves are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a distinctive auriculate base that gives the plant its common name. It is often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This non-vascular plant lacks true roots and relies on its dense foliage for water retention and photosynthesis.</p>
