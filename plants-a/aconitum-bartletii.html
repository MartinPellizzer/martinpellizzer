                <h1>Aconitum bartletii</h1>
<p>Aconitum bartletii, commonly known as Bartlett's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces follicles that contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bartletii has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through explosive dispersal when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and adapted for absorbing moisture from the damp, rocky habitats where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bartletii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, specifically in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. It thrives in temperate climates with cool summers and cold winters.</p>
<p>Aconitum bartletii is often found in alpine meadows at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bartletii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along streambanks. This plant is known for its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is relatively limited and it is not considered invasive in these areas.</p>
