                <h1>Adenosma biplicata</h1>
<p>Adenosma biplicata, commonly known as the zigzag or pleated adenosma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adenosma biplicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma biplicata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring five pink to reddish-purple petals, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma biplicata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant typically grows in forest understories or along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its distribution is also noted in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Adenosma biplicata is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats, showing some adaptability to different soil types.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma biplicata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in agricultural fields, along roadsides, and in degraded grasslands. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in some ecosystems.</p>
