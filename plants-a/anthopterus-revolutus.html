<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically curled or rolled when young. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>Anthopterus revolutus is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
