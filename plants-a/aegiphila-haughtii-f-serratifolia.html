                    <h1>Aegiphila haughtii f. serratifolia</h1>
<p>Aegiphila haughtii f. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf aegiphila, is a compact shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white pubescence, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
