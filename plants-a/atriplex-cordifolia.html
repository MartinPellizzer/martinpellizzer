<p>Atriplex cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically heart-shaped, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Atriplex cordifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
