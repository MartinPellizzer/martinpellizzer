<p>Abies alba subsp.</p>
<p>acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaf silver fir, is a subspecies of the silver fir native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are sharply pointed.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches, giving the tree a uniform and elegant appearance. It produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in forested areas at higher altitudes.</p>
