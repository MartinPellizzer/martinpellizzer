                    <h1>Aconitum trichocarpum</h1>
<p>Aconitum trichocarpum, commonly known as the hairy fruit monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with alternating leaves that are palmately lobed. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single cluster at the top of the stem, and it produces small, hairy fruits that mature in late summer.</p>
<p>Aconitum trichocarpum is known for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle.</p>
