                <h1>Acinodendron coriaceum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf acinodendron, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acinodendron coriaceum is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron coriaceum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, and typically dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to grey in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron coriaceum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, savannas, and rocky hillsides where the climate is warm and dry. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary vegetation in disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron coriaceum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and the Caribbean. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, leathery leaves. It has been introduced to various locations as an ornamental species, sometimes escaping cultivation and establishing itself in natural habitats.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
