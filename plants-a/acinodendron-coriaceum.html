                    <h1>Acinodendron coriaceum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf acinodendron, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acinodendron coriaceum is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
