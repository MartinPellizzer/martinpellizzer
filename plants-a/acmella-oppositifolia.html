                <h1>Acmella oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia, commonly known as the "lion's mouth," is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange petals and spiny, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows upright, with a pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant absorb moisture from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across various regions of South America, with some populations also found in parts of Central America. This species thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acmella oppositifolia is considered to be of conservation concern, though its exact status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia is a compact, ornamental plant known for its vibrant orange flowers and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, but it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage flowering. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though aphids and powdery mildew can occasionally occur.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia is a flowering plant known for its culinary use, particularly in traditional cuisines where its leaves are used as a vegetable.</p>
<p>It also has medicinal applications, with its extracts used in some cultures to treat inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through agriculture and trade in regions where it is cultivated.
