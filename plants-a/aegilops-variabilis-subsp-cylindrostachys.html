<p>Aegilops variabilis subsp.</p>
<p>cylindrostachys, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow leaves, which are typically hairy along the edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in tough, straw-like glumes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
