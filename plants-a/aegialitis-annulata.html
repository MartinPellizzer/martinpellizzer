                <h1>Aegialitis annulata</h1>
<p>Aegialitis annulata, commonly known as the mangrove button, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as mangrove forests. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Aegialitis annulata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialitis annulata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with fine, white hairs, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
