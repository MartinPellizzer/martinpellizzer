                        <h1>Acalypha macrosperma</h1>
<p>Acalypha macrosperma, commonly known as the giant spurflower, is a striking shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often feature distinctive red or orange bracts, which are modified leaves that serve to attract pollinators. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation in warm climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macrosperma is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also present in parts of southern China and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes wetlands, swamps, and other waterlogged areas where it can flourish.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
