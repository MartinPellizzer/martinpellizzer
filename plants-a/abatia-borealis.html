<p>Abatia borealis, commonly known as the northern abatia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to minimize heat loss and maximize light absorption.</p>
<p>Abatia borealis plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
