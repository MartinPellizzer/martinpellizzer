<p>Aridaria abbreviata, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as succulent leaves and deep root systems. Its flowering period typically occurs during the cooler months, providing nectar for pollinators in otherwise barren landscapes.</p>
<p>Aridaria abbreviata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in arid ecosystems.</p>
