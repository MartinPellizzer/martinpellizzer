                <h1>Achradotypus coriaceus</h1>
<p>Achradotypus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved achradotypus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, granular texture, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achradotypus coriaceus has leaves that are broadly ovate, dark green in color, with a leathery texture and a waxy coating, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, compact form. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradotypus coriaceus is primarily native to the southern regions of Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid areas of the country, including the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing on mountain slopes and in coastal regions. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradotypus coriaceus was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in disturbed soils. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in these regions. It is typically found in open vegetation types such as renosterveld and fynbos.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a characteristic component of the local flora in these areas.</p>
