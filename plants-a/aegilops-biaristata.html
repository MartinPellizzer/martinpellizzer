                <h1>Aegilops biaristata</h1>
<p>Aegilops biaristata, commonly known as the two-rowed wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-rowed glumes. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into hard, straw-colored grains. It is closely related to domesticated wheat and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement.</p>
<p>Aegilops biaristata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a valuable genetic resource for wheat breeding programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops biaristata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in length from 5 to 15 cm with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, blooming in early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry, three-angled spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind due to the lightweight, winged seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
