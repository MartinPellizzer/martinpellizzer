                <h1>Aegiphila verticillata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila verticillata, commonly known as the clustered leaf mallow, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and arranged in whorls of three to five. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Aegiphila verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila verticillata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
