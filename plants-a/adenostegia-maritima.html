                <h1>Adenostegia maritima</h1>
<p>Adenostegia maritima, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across coastal dunes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Adenostegia maritima plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia maritima has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more cracked with age, and it grows in a creeping or prostrate manner. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia maritima is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly along the southern coast of South Africa and parts of Namibia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity and strong coastal winds. This plant is commonly found in dune systems and other maritime environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and periodic inundation.</p>
<p>Adenostegia maritima is an important component of the local flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia maritima was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy environments where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dune ecosystems, often growing in areas with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant has been reported in several regions along the Pacific coast, including California and Baja California. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these fragile habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
