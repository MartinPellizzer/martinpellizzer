                <h1>Achimenes rusbyi</h1>
<p>Achimenes rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's stormwater plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces showy, clustered blooms that are often used in ornamental horticulture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Achimenes rusbyi is valued for its vibrant flowers and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes rusbyi has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular with a spurred base, displaying vibrant red and orange hues, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes rusbyi is a flowering plant native to the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is currently found in specific areas of central Africa, primarily in the Ituri and Bas-Congo provinces. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or under the canopy of tall trees. It typically occurs at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achimenes rusbyi is a vibrant, tuberous plant known for its striking flowers and easy care, making it a favorite among gardeners.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through tuber division in spring or by seed, though tuber division is more reliable for maintaining the plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Achimenes rusbyi involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and blooming in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with consistent moisture, requiring regular watering but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its health and shape. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions, so proper air circulation is essential.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetics.</p>
