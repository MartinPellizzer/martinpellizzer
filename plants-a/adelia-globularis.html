                <h1>Adelia globularis</h1>
<p>Adelia globularis, commonly known as the globular milkbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Adelia globularis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia globularis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are simple, consisting of five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia globularis is primarily native to the western coast of Africa, specifically in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Togo.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in moist woodlands and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is also valued for ornamental purposes in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia globularis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and dunes, where it thrives in sandy soils. This plant is often used for dune stabilization due to its extensive root system. However, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
