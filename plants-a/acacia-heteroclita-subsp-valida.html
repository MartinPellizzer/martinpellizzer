<p>Acacia heteroclita subsp.</p>
<p>valida, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often serpentine branches and phyllodes that are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
