                    <h1>Arceuthobium capense</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium capense, commonly known as the Cape witch's butter, is a parasitic plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant is notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are propelled through the air when disturbed. Its small, fleshy, yellowish-brown fruit resembles a piece of butter, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
