                <h1>Absinthium bipedale</h1>
<p>Absinthium bipedale, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, with a strong, bitter scent.</p>
<p>Absinthium bipedale is known for its high concentration of volatile oils, particularly thujone, which contributes to its historical use in absinthe.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium bipedale has leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated along the edges, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring four petals each, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium bipedale is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of Europe and North America, where it has been introduced either intentionally or accidentally. This species thrives in dry, rocky slopes and grasslands, often in sunny, well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Absinthium bipedale is considered a species of concern in some regions, though its conservation status remains relatively stable in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Absinthium bipedale is a hardy perennial plant known for its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division of mature plants, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Absinthium bipedale includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new shoots. Common pests include aphids and slugs, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or thyme can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
