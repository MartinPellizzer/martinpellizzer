                    <h1>Agrostocrinum</h1>
<p>Agrostocrinum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common to many members of its family. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Agrostocrinum plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
