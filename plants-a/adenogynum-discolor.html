                <h1>Adenogynum discolor</h1>
<p>Adenogynum discolor, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers, which range in color from purple to white, are often borne in clusters at the ends of branches.</p>
<p>Adenogynum discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for its aesthetic beauty in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogynum discolor has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale brown color, growing upright and branching sparsely. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogynum discolor is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded areas within these ecosystems. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing as an understory species. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogynum discolor was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Florida and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and estuarine environments. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water conditions. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as coastal development and the transport of aquatic plants.</p>
