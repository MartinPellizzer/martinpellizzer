<p>Asplenium schizotrichum, commonly known as the forked spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, stream banks, and woodland floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fronds that are usually dark green and finely divided. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium schizotrichum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
