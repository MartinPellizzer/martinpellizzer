                <h1>Actinella scaposa</h1>
<p>Actinella scaposa, commonly known as the scapose actinella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are usually basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster, and bloom in late summer to early fall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella scaposa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a light green color and a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella scaposa is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It is often associated with open, sunny habitats such as sand dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Actinella scaposa is part of the dandelion family and is well adapted to the maritime climate of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella scaposa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in several regions. The plant is typically found in coastal and subalpine habitats. It is considered a potential threat to native flora due to its invasive tendencies.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread across the North and South Islands.</p>
