                    <h1>Alsophila strigillosa</h1>
<p>Alsophila strigillosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Alsophila strigillosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
