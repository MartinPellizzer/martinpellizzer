<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and closely spaced, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Actinella acaulis caespitosa is often found growing on rocky slopes and in open, sunny habitats.</p>
