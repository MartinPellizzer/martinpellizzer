<p>Alchemilla xerampelina, commonly known as the silver-leaved alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
