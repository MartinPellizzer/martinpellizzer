                    <h1>Acrocarpidium serpens</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium serpens, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its creeping growth habit and distinctive, serpentine fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help retain soil moisture. Its fronds are bi-lobed and often have a waxy coating, which aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Acrocarpidium serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance.</p>
