                <h1>Acrophorus repens</h1>
<p>Acrophorus repens, commonly known as the creeping acanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it often forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Acrophorus repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus repens has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, creeping along the ground, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus repens is primarily native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with riverine and coastal forests.</p>
<p>Acrophorus repens is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus repens was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine environments in New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish waters, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense mats have led to the displacement of native plants in these ecosystems. It is commonly found in tidal zones and along the edges of freshwater lakes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter habitat structure and reduce biodiversity.</p>
