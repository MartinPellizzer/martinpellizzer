<p>Acrophorus repens, commonly known as the creeping acanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it often forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Acrophorus repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
