                <h1>Achillea compacta</h1>
<p>Achillea compacta, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, flat clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has a long history of medicinal use.</p>
<p>Achillea compacta is also known for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea compacta has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, with a compact growth pattern that forms a low, dense mat. Its flower heads are yellow and consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea compacta is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula and parts of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across Europe, including southern France, Italy, and parts of the Mediterranean. This species thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, often growing in open, well-drained areas. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achillea compacta is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea compacta is a hardy perennial known for its compact growth and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds directly in the garden in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, becoming active in spring and blooming throughout summer before going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or coneflower enhances its ornamental value and supports beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea compacta is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and a habitat for nesting. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil health and promoting biodiversity. Additionally, its dense growth habit helps with erosion control, stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea compacta also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting local ecosystems and maintaining a balanced environment for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea compacta is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, commonly used in traditional remedies to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions.</p>
