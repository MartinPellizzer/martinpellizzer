                    <h1>Anthemis biaristata</h1>
<p>Anthemis biaristata, commonly known as the Sierra Madre everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flower heads that are often mistaken for single flowers, but they consist of many tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural wild environment.</p>
