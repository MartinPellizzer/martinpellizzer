                        <h1>Acanthonema diandrum</h1>
<p>Acanthonema diandrum, commonly known as the hard-stemmed starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a rough texture and serrated edges.</p>
<p>Acanthonema diandrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthonema diandrum is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. It prefers nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with humid tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthonema diandrum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in non-native regions. It has been reported in several countries, including parts of Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it poses a risk to local ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
