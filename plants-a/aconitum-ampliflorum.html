                <h1>Aconitum ampliflorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum ampliflorum, commonly known as the broadflower monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum ampliflorum has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a helmet-shaped structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by bees. The plant produces follicles as its fruit, containing small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are thick, tuberous, and toxic, often forming a dense network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum ampliflorum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at high altitudes. This species is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its showy, blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum ampliflorum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
