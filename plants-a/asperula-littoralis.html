<p>It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Asperula littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion.</p>
