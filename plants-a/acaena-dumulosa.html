                <h1>Acaena dumulosa</h1>
<p>Acaena dumulosa, commonly known as the New Zealand burr or mat grass, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, followed by spiny, bristly fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>Acaena dumulosa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena dumulosa has compound, alternate leaves that are oval to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, with a rough, woody texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a sprawling or ascending manner. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with five petals, blooming from late winter to early spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a burr-like structure containing several seeds, which are dispersed by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its coastal or sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena dumulosa is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island.</p>
<p>It is now also present in parts of Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, heathlands, and rocky areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 50 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acaena dumulosa is listed as a threatened species in New Zealand due to habitat loss and competition from invasive plants.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena dumulosa is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to New Zealand, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization is minimal, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or herbs can enhance its ecological benefits and improve soil stability.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena dumulosa is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, white flowers. The plant acts as a valuable companion plant in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its dense growth habit also helps in creating microhabitats for insects and other small creatures.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acaena dumulosa contributes to the overall biodiversity of its ecosystem by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
