                        <h1>Acaena dumulosa</h1>
<p>Acaena dumulosa, commonly known as the tufted knapweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bristly, spiny fruits. Its leaves are alternate, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Acaena dumulosa is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena dumulosa is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acaena dumulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena dumulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and disturbed areas, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
