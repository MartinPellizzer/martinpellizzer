                        <h1>Acacia celsiana</h1>
<p>Acacia celsiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, phyllode-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia celsiana is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
