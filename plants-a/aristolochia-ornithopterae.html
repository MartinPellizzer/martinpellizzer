                    <h1>Aristolochia ornithopterae</h1>
<p>Aristolochia ornithopterae, commonly known as the birdwing arrowhead, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe or a bird's beak. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain toxic seeds, a trait common among members of the Aristolochiaceae family. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
