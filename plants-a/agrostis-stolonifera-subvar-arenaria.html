                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera subvar. arenaria</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera subvar. arenaria, commonly known as beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, wiry stems that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread rapidly, forming dense vegetation that stabilizes sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits.</p>
