                <h1>Acinodendron integrifolium</h1>
<p>Acinodendron integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaf acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acinodendron integrifolium is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and riverine areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron integrifolium has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. Its small, clustered white flowers have five petals and appear in spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron integrifolium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and ample sunlight, making it a common component of the understory vegetation. Its native range extends into parts of tropical Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron integrifolium was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its dense foliage and attractive appearance. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, leading to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond intended areas.</p>
