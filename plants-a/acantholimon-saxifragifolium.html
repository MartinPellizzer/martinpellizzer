                        <h1>Acantholimon saxifragifolium</h1>
<p>Acantholimon saxifragifolium, commonly known as the saxifrage-leaved thornweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs that provide additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Acantholimon saxifragifolium is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes where moisture is limited.</p>
