<p>It features slender, upright stems and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers resembling daisies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis var. delphinensis has basal, lanceolate to ovate leaves that are usually gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and slightly reddish-brown in color, growing in a丛生 pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of pale blue to white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis var. delphinensis is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Greece, Turkey, and the western coast of the Black Sea. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and along coastal cliffs. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as a species of concern in some regions, though its conservation status varies by country.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis var. delphinensis is a hardy perennial known for its striking blue-green foliage and daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or marigolds can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
