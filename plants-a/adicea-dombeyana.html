                <h1>Adicea dombeyana</h1>
<p>Adicea dombeyana, commonly known as the Dombey's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branched.</p>
<p>Adicea dombeyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea dombeyana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, herbaceous, and have a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea dombeyana is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas, cliffs, and dry, sunny habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with maritime environments. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>Adicea dombeyana is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea dombeyana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various regions. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread.</p>
