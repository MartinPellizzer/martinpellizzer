<p>Aspidium lomatopus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for life in water. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Aspidium lomatopus plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
