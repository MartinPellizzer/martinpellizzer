                <h1>Aberia afra</h1>
<p>Aberia afra, commonly known as African milk tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and a milky sap that exudes when the stems are broken. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing succulent features that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces capsules as fruits.</p>
<p>Aberia afra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aberia afra has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and exhibits a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with four petals, blooming during the summer months, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberia afra is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Karoo region and surrounding areas, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and open grasslands, often in areas with low rainfall. Aberia afra is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aberia afra is a hardy shrub native to southern Africa, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2-3 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage flowering. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while root rot can occur in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like agave or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aberia afra is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its abundant flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and benefiting nearby plants. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Aberia afra supports biodiversity by creating microhabitats for insects and other small organisms.</p>
