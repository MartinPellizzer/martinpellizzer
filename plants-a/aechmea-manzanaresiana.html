The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, long-lasting inflorescences that range from white to pink. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
