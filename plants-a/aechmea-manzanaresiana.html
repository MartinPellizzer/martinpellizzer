                <h1>Aechmea manzanaresiana</h1>
<p>Aechmea manzanaresiana, commonly known as the Manzanares bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, long-lasting inflorescences that range from white to pink. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea manzanaresiana has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem, with a bright green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upward from the base. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in the summer months and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds and mammals feeding on the flesh.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in the soil while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
