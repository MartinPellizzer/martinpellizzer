                    <h1>Amygdalus carduchorum var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Amygdalus carduchorum var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded wild almond, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deciduous, compound leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces oval, woody fruits containing large, edible seeds that are encased in a hard shell. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and genetic studies.</p>
