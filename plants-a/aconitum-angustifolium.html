                <h1>Aconitum angustifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum angustifolium has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are narrow and elongated, typically 10â€“30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, forming dense spikes with spurred petals, and bloom from July to August, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for nutrient storage and anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum angustifolium is primarily native to Italy, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen. It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine regions, particularly in rocky and grassy areas.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in cooler climates and is often associated with mountainous terrain. Its distribution includes parts of the Italian Alps and the northern regions of the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum angustifolium was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant has since spread into natural habitats, particularly in moist, shaded areas of forests and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered to have a limited impact compared to other invasive species.</p>
