                    <h1>Aconitum angustifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
