                <h1>Aconitum jaluense</h1>
<p>Aconitum jaluense, commonly known as the Jalu monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, spicate inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum jaluense has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum jaluense is primarily native to Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and Primorye.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, typically in moist, shaded habitats. It is commonly associated with forest understories and rocky slopes. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking purple or blue flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the temperate climates of East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum jaluense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wild in its native habitat, which includes parts of East Asia. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty, with its striking blue or purple flowers. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
