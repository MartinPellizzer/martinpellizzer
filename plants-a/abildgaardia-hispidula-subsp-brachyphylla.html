<p>Abildgaardia hispidula subsp.</p>
<p>brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
