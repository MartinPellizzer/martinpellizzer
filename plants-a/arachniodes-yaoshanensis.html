<p>Arachniodes yaoshanensis, commonly known as the Yaoshan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
