                    <h1>Agave concinna</h1>
<p>Agave concinna, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and blue-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces a tall, flowering stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by small, pear-shaped fruits. Agave concinna is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
