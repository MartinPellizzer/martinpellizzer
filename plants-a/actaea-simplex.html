                <h1>Actaea simplex</h1>
<p>Actaea simplex, commonly known as white cohosh, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Actaea simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and has a long history of traditional medicinal use.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea simplex has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring about 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly hairy texture. The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more grayish with age, and it grows upright with a single trunk. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in an umbel, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate, containing numerous small seeds that are dispersed by animals through ingestion.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea simplex is primarily native to Amur, China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, Chita, Inner Mongolia, Japan, Kamchatka, Khabarovsk, Korea, Kuril Is., Manchuria, Mongolia, Primorye, Sakhalin, Yakutiya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and mountainous regions across these regions. This plant thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soil. It is often associated with shaded understory environments in coniferous and mixed forests.</p>
<p>Actaea simplex is a valuable component of the flora in these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea simplex was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now focused on controlling its population to protect local ecosystems.</p>
