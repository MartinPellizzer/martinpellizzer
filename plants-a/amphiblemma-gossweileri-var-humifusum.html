                    <h1>Amphiblemma gossweileri var. humifusum</h1>
<p>Amphiblemma gossweileri var. humifusum, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
