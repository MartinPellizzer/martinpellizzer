<p>Aulonemia yanachagensis, commonly known as the Yanachangen moss, is a rare species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, acicular leaves that are typically 1â€“2 mm in length. The plant is adapted to harsh, arid environments, exhibiting features such as thick, waxy cuticles to reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky crevices or on soil surfaces in semi-desert regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme habitats.</p>
