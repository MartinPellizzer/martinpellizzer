                <h1>Acianthera parvula</h1>
<p>Acianthera parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a compact growth habit, typically found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in a basal rosette, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed.</p>
<p>Acianthera parvula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera parvula has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern, with a pale green bark. Its flowers are delicate, with a single lip-like petal, and are typically pale pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera parvula is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern South America, including parts of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>This orchid species thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall and dense vegetation. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and partial shade, often growing along forest edges or in secondary growth habitats. Due to habitat loss, Acianthera parvula is considered threatened in many parts of its native range.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare and ecologically important plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera parvula was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for regions with high rainfall. The plant is often found in forest understories and along stream banks where it can receive adequate light and moisture. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of South America.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common ornamental plant in horticultural trade.</p>
