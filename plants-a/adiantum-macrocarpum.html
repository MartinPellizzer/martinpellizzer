<p>Adiantum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a strikingly elegant fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters, with a feathery, lacy appearance. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are dark green and often have a bluish tint, with tiny, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum macrocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
