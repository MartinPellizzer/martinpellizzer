<p>Agrostis alba var. compacta, commonly known as silvergrass or whitegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and silvery-blue foliage due to the fine, soft hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Agrostis alba var. compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
