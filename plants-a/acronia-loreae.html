                <h1>Acronia loreae</h1>
<p>Acronia loreae, commonly known as the Lore's acronia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Acronia loreae thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia loreae has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a slightly serrated margin. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, bloom during the spring months, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia loreae is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, specifically in the states of Guanajuato and Quer√©taro.</p>
<p>It grows in rocky and well-drained soils within cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level. This plant is adapted to the humid and cool climate of its native habitat, where it thrives in shaded understory environments. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Acronia loreae is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this plant from threats such as habitat loss and overcollection.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia loreae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in states like California and Nevada. Its introduction has been linked to human activity, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
