<p>Androsace multiflora, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of small, fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments.

It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Androsace multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
