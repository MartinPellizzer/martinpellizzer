                <h1>Achyranthes humilis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes humilis, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing tiny seeds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Achyranthes humilis is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with limited water availability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes humilis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color and a spreading growth pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, featuring five sepals and petals, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-chambered capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
