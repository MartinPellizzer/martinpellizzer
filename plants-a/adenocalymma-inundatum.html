                <h1>Adenocalymma inundatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma inundatum, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy and trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are flexible and adapted for underwater life.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma inundatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma inundatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the cooler months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in moist, swampy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma inundatum is primarily native to the northern parts of South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland and swampy areas, particularly in the Amazon Basin. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is often associated with flooded vegetation and can be found in areas with standing water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of waterlogged soils and seasonal flooding.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma inundatum was mainly introduced to areas with wetland habitats, particularly in regions experiencing periodic flooding.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy environments. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed sites such as riverbanks, ditches, and drainage areas. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities like land development and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
