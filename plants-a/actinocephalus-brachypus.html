                <h1>Actinocephalus brachypus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus brachypus, commonly known as the broad-leaved actinocephalus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus brachypus has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus brachypus is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like montane forests and riverine woodlands. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus brachypus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still under study.</p>
