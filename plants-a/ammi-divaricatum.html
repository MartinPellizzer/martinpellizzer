                    <h1>Ammi divaricatum</h1>
<p>Ammi divaricatum, commonly known as Indian hemlock, is a biennial or annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic and have a distinctive, slightly bitter scent. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the Apiaceae (carrot) family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, papery fruits called schizocarps, which release tiny seeds when disturbed.</p>
<p>Ammi divaricatum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
