                <h1>Adenocalymma microcarpum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited adenocalymma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its small, woody fruits and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma microcarpum is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma microcarpum has small, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant is commonly found.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma microcarpum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. It is commonly associated with humid forests and rocky outcrops in this region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to these specific areas within Brazil's southeastern states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma microcarpum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was originally native to South America, specifically Brazil and Paraguay. This plant has been reported in wetland and disturbed areas, often near water bodies. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as landscaping and accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in its introduced range.</p>
