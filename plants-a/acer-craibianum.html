                    <h1>Acer craibianum</h1>
<p>Acer craibianum, commonly known as the Craib's maple, is a rare and little-studied species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer craibianum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
