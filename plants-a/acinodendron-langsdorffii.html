                <h1>Acinodendron langsdorffii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron langsdorffii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, greenish-yellow fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The tree is also noted for its ability to exude a milky sap when injured, which is a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron langsdorffii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron langsdorffii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in lowland and mountainous areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in moist forests, riverine woodlands, and secondary growth habitats. It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of suitable microhabitats and climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron langsdorffii was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with disturbed soil and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can establish itself quickly. Its introduction can lead to changes in local ecosystems by outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas.</p>
