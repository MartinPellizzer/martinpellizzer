<p>Acinodendron langsdorffii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, greenish-yellow fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The tree is also noted for its ability to exude a milky sap when injured, which is a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
