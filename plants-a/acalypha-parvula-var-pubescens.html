                        <h1>Acalypha parvula var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Acalypha parvula var. pubescens, commonly known as the silky ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
