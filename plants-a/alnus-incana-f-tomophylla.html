<p>Alnus incana f. tomophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, elongated leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical form. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in riparian zones. It produces small, catkin-like flowers and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
<p>This form is particularly adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in ecological succession.</p>
