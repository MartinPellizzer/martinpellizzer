                <h1>Achillea bandana</h1>
<p>Achillea bandana, commonly known as the showy yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of gray-green, fern-like leaves and produces flat, showy clusters of white to pinkish flowers. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and native plant landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bandana has leaves that are broadly lance-shaped, with a grayish-blue color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of small, white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea bandana is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in parts of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas where it was originally native, though it is now also cultivated in gardens and botanical collections worldwide. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea bandana is considered to be of conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited natural range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea bandana is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of established clumps, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining its vigor. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and summer, followed by a period of rest in winter.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during the growing season, but it is drought-tolerant once established, and fertilization should be done in early spring to promote healthy growth. Pruning back spent flower heads encourages re-blooming, while common pests include aphids and spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its appearance and deter harmful insects.</p>
