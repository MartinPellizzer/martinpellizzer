                <h1>Achyrocline glandulosa</h1>
<p>Achyrocline glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and shrublands. Its leaves are often covered in small, glandular hairs, which may aid in water retention or deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom during the warmer months.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline glandulosa has leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape, with a dull green color and a hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and often covered with fine, glandular hairs, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline glandulosa is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and eastern parts of South America.</p>
<p>The species is often associated with dry to semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline glandulosa was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, particularly in the states of Esp√≠rito Santo and Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>It has also been recorded in parts of Argentina and Uruguay, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and coastal dunes. The plant is considered an invasive species in these areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in areas with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, such as accidental transport via vehicles or maritime trade.</p>
