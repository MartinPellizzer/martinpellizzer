<p>Ancistrophyllum laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentian spruce, is a rare coniferous tree native to the boreal forests of eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
