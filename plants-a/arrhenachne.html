                    <h1>Arrhenachne</h1>
<p>Arrhenachne, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets that often bear two to three bracts. The plants typically grow in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and are found in tropical and subtropical regions. Arrhenachne species have small, wind-pollinated flowers and are often used in ecological studies due to their role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them important indicators of hydrological conditions in their habitats.</p>
