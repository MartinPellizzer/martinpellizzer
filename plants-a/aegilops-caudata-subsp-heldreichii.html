<p>heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan goatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often drooping or curved.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its inflorescence consists of two to four spikelets, with the lower one usually shorter and more compact.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications.</p>
