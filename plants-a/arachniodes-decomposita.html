                    <h1>Arachniodes decomposita</h1>
<p>Arachniodes decomposita, commonly known as the fragmented fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The unique structure of its fronds allows for efficient water retention and light absorption in low-light conditions.</p>
