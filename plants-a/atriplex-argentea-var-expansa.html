                    <h1>Atriplex argentea var. expansa</h1>
<p>Atriplex argentea var. expansa, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs that reduce water loss. The plant has small, green to yellowish leaves that are often expanded at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces greenish-white flowers in compact clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
