                <h1>Anathallis iguapensis</h1>
<p>Anathallis iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguape orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Amazon rainforest of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its roots without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday, a trait common among many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood and critically endangered species.</p>
