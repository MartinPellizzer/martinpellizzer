                    <h1>Agrostophyllum compressum</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum compressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark green to brownish thallus. The plant consists of a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on rocks, soil, or tree bark in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
