                    <h1>Acacia verniciflua</h1>
<p>Acacia verniciflua, commonly known as the gum acacia or kara kara, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The tree is also notable for producing a resin, which has been used historically by Indigenous Australians for various purposes.</p>
