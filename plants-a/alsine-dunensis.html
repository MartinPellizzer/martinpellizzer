                    <h1>Alsine dunensis</h1>
<p>Alsine dunensis, commonly known as the sand alsike, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which reduces water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
