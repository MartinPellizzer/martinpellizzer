<p>Alocasia maquilingensis, commonly known as the Maquiling arrowleaf, is a rare and striking plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a deep green color and a glossy texture. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix and spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
