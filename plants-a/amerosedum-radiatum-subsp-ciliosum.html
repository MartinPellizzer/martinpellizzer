<p>Amerosedum radiatum subsp.</p>
<p>ciliosum, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The species thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
