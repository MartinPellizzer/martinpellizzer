                    <h1>Abacopteris nudata</h1>
<p>Abacopteris nudata, commonly known as the naked leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched fronds that lack the typical pinnae found in many ferns. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
