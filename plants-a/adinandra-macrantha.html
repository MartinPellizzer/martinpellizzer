                <h1>Adinandra macrantha</h1>
<p>Adinandra macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in axillary inflorescences. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adinandra macrantha is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra macrantha has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra macrantha is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often growing in areas with high humidity and fertile soil. The plant thrives in shaded environments and is typically found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. It is also present in parts of India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Adinandra macrantha is an important component of the flora in these regions, contributing to the biodiversity of the local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra macrantha was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa, and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadside verges and degraded forests. This plant is often used for reforestation and soil stabilization due to its rapid growth and hardy nature. It has been reported in countries like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines as an introduced species.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native regions.</p>
