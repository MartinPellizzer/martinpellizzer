                <h1>Adenopetalum bracteatum</h1>
<p>Adenopetalum bracteatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and vegetative means.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum bracteatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum bracteatum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically green and have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are showy, with five petals arranged in a funnel shape, displaying a pale pink to white color, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it to absorb nutrients and water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum bracteatum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Sonora. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with desert and semi-desert environments. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can be found in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum bracteatum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, where it can thrive in both natural and human-altered environments. This plant is often associated with areas that have been disturbed by agriculture or construction, making it a common weed in such settings. Its introduction has been documented in several states across the United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a persistent species in many ecosystems where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
