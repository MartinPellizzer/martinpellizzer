                    <h1>Achyrophorus hohenackeri</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's bladder fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated sporangia that resemble bladders, a unique adaptation for spore dispersal. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its leaves are typically small and clustered, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
