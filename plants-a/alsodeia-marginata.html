<p>Alsodeia marginata, commonly known as the coastal alsike, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
