                    <h1>Avena rupestris</h1>
<p>Avena rupestris, commonly known as cliff grass or rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the rocky and arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Avena rupestris is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
