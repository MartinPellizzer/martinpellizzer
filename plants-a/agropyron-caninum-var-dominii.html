                    <h1>Agropyron caninum var. dominii</h1>
<p>Agropyron caninum var. dominii, commonly known as the Domin's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This grass is often found in steppes and rocky soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
