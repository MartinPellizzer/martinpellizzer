                    <h1>Ajuga xylorrhiza</h1>
<p>Ajuga xylorrhiza, commonly known as the creeping Jenny or false spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed.</p>
