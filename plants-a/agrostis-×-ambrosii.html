                    <h1>Agrostis × ambrosii</h1>
<p>Agrostis × ambrosii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited, but it plays a role in stabilizing soil in certain environments.</p>
