                    <h1>Artemisia saxicola</h1>
<p>Artemisia saxicola, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a hardy perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or desert environments. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late summer and are clustered in spherical heads.</p>
<p>Artemisia saxicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
