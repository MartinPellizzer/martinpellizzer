                    <h1>Alsophila mucronata</h1>
<p>Alsophila mucronata, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's unique botanical features make it a valuable subject for both ecological and horticultural study.</p>
