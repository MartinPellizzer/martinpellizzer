<p>Aspidium plantagineum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors.
