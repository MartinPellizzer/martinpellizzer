                <h1>Acinodendron corymbiforme</h1>
<p>Acinodendron corymbiforme, commonly known as the yellow-flowered acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth surface, while the fruit is a small, capsule-like structure.</p>
<p>Acinodendron corymbiforme is often found in woodland and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron corymbiforme has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in corymbs, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron corymbiforme is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. This plant is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks where it benefits from the moist environment. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the climate and vegetation patterns of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron corymbiforme was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
