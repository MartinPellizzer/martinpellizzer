                <h1>Adenoropium berlandieri</h1>
<p>Adenoropium berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Adenoropium berlandieri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoropium berlandieri has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium berlandieri is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Chihuahua. This plant thrives in rocky soils and can often be seen growing in desert environments. It is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with limestone and sandstone substrates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium berlandieri was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern region, as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers.</p>
<p>It was initially cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its rapid spread and ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to control its spread and manage its impact on native plant communities.</p>
