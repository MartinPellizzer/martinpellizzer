                <h1>Acrostichum auriculatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum auriculatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Acrostichum auriculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum auriculatum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture and a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is sturdy and slightly woody with a rough, bark-like texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is wind-pollinated. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed that is dispersed by water, as the fruit is buoyant.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum auriculatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, often near rivers and coastal regions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, mangroves, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. It is particularly common in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its preference for warm, humid climates with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum auriculatum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, mangrove swamps, and other moist, tropical environments. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can become invasive in certain areas. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>It is now considered a noxious weed in some regions where it has spread beyond its original range.</p>
