                <h1>Acourtia hondurana</h1>
<p>Acourtia hondurana, commonly known as the Honduras acourtia, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Honduras.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in a composite head.</p>
<p>Acourtia hondurana is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia hondurana has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, bark-like texture, typically ranging from gray to brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia hondurana is primarily native to Belize and Honduras.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. Acourtia hondurana is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of Belize and Honduras.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia hondurana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Central America and parts of the Caribbean. Its introduction has been associated with its ability to colonize disturbed habitats quickly, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a significant concern in some regions where it competes with native plant species.</p>
