                    <h1>Arum montanum</h1>
<p>Arum montanum, commonly known as the mountain arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive underground tuber and tall, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces a spadix, which is surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical structure supports its role as both an ornamental and a potential medicinal plant.</p>
