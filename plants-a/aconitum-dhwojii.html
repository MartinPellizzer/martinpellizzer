                <h1>Aconitum dhwojii</h1>
<p>Aconitum dhwojii, commonly known as the Nepal aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with rough, hairy leaves. Its flowers are arranged in a spires and are highly ornamental, though the plant is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.</p>
<p>Aconitum dhwojii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum dhwojii has leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and cylindrical, typically ranging from green to reddish-brown, with a growth pattern that is upright and branching. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in dense, sparsely branched racemes, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, temperate habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum dhwojii is primarily native to Nepal.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Himalayan foothills. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments within alpine and subalpine habitats. It is commonly encountered in forested areas and meadows at higher elevations.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the cool and humid climate of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum dhwojii was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and tall, dramatic growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas in regions with temperate climates. Although it is not native to these areas, it has established itself in the wild in some parts of the United States. The plant is considered invasive in certain regions because of its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
