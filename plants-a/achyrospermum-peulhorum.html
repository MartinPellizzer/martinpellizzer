<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum, commonly known as the African bluebell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Central Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy flowers. It has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions as a garden plant.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
