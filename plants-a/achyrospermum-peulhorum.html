                <h1>Achyrospermum peulhorum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum has simple, opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark, growing upright with a branched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with yellow petals and a greenish calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum is a flowering plant native to Madagascar, where it grows in specific regions of the island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to the southeastern part of Madagascar, particularly in the rainforest areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found under the canopy of dense forests. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant flowers and bushy growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its colorful flowers, aiding in the reproduction of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in areas prone to degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting biodiversity in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum is a plant that has limited documented uses, but it is primarily known for its ornamental value due to its attractive flowers.</p>
<p>In some regions, parts of the plant may be used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. It is also occasionally cultivated for horticultural purposes, contributing to local biodiversity and landscape beauty. However, there is little evidence of its use in culinary or industrial applications.</p>
<p>Its cultural significance remains largely undocumented, though it may hold symbolic value in certain indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum peulhorum has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, with popular cultivars such as 'Albiflorum' and 'Variegatum' standing out for their unique foliage and flower colors.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids of this species are relatively rare, horticulturists have developed some crosses with related species to enhance flower size and color diversity. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different growing conditions, making them more suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to their striking appearance and relative ease of care, Achyrospermum peulhorum and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance in both commercial and home gardening settings.</p>
