                    <h1>Anopteris</h1>
<p>Anopteris, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Anopteris species are often found growing on rocky outcrops, cliffs, and in shaded, moist environments. They have a robust rhizome system that allows them to anchor firmly in crevices and absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Anopteris panicea, which is widely distributed across Asia and the Pacific.</p>
