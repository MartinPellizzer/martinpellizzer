                <h1>Acronychia laevis</h1>
<p>Acronychia laevis, commonly known as the smooth acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it grows in tropical rainforests and coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Acronychia laevis is often used in traditional Indigenous practices and has some ornamental value due to its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia laevis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant ages. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth capsule that splits open to release dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia laevis is primarily native to New Caledonia and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. This plant typically grows in coastal or lowland rainforest habitats. It is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions in the Pacific and Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia laevis was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dune environments and near the shoreline. This plant is often used in coastal stabilization projects due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray. It has also been introduced to some parts of Southeast Asia for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
