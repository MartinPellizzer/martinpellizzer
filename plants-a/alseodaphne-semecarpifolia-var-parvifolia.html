                    <h1>Alseodaphne semecarpifolia var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Alseodaphne semecarpifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sandalwood, is a member of the樟科 (Lauraceae) family.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark, aromatic seeds that are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its timber, which is similar to sandalwood in scent and texture, though it is less commercially significant.</p>
