                <h1>Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 12 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, contributing to its stability in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited and largely restricted to specific areas in these regions, where it grows in isolated populations. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests and mountainous terrain, typically at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited natural regeneration, it is considered vulnerable, with conservation efforts focused on protecting its remaining wild populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum is a slow-growing, ornamental tree known for its unique, twisted trunk and vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this tree is typically slow, with noticeable growth during the spring and early summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain its natural form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-tolerant species can enhance its aesthetic value in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum is a lesser-known plant species with limited documented uses, primarily found in specific regions of China.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have local traditional uses in certain communities. Its medicinal properties are not well-studied, but like many Acer species, it may contain compounds with potential health benefits. In terms of industrial or economic value, it likely contributes minimally to local ecosystems or horticulture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in traditional Chinese botany or regional folklore, though this remains underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Purpureum' and 'Variegatum', which display striking red and variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used in hybrid breeding programs to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. Hybrids involving this variety often include crosses with other maple species like Acer palmatum and Acer negundo. These hybrids are prized for their unique leaf patterns and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum holds significant horticultural importance due to its aesthetic appeal and genetic contributions to ornamental maple cultivation.</p>
