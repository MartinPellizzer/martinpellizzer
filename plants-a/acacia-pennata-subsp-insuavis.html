                        <h1>Acacia pennata subsp. insuavis</h1>
<p>Acacia pennata subsp.</p>
<p>insuavis, commonly known as the bitter acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its bark and leaves contain bitter compounds, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pennata subsp.</p>
<p>insuavis is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the southern part of the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in regions with a subtropical to warm temperate climate. It is often associated with coastal heathlands and dunes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pennata subsp.</p>
<p>insuavis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European colonization effort.</p>
<p>The plant was initially planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
