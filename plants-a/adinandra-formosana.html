                <h1>Adinandra formosana</h1>
<p>Adinandra formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is often found in secondary forests.</p>
<p>Adinandra formosana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra formosana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal ingestion, with the seeds passing through the digestive system and being deposited in new locations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra formosana is primarily native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is found in the wild across various regions of the island, particularly in forested areas. This plant thrives in humid and subtropical climates, which are characteristic of Taiwan's diverse ecosystems. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is commonly seen in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to Taiwan, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra formosana was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Taiwan, the Philippines, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
