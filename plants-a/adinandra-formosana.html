                <h1>Adinandra formosana</h1>
<p>Adinandra formosana, commonly known as the Formosa adenium, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are often fragrant. It is adapted to grow in rocky or dry environments, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra formosana has compound, pinnate leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 10 to 20 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a faint resinous scent. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring to early summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-winged capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with the seeds being light and equipped with feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra formosana is a rare plant native to Taiwan, specifically found in the central and southern regions of the island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few fragmented habitats, primarily in the mountainous areas of Taiwan. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as evergreen forests, often growing on rocky or clayey soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Adinandra formosana is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra formosana is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desirable traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its growth and create a lush, diverse garden environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adinandra formosana is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the surrounding flora. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in its vicinity. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil on slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
