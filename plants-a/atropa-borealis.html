                    <h1>Atropa borealis</h1>
<p>Atropa borealis, commonly known as the northern belladonna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late summer. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, including atropine and scopolamine, which are similar to those found in other members of the nightshade family. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its chemical properties.</p>
