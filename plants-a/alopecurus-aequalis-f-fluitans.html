                    <h1>Alopecurus aequalis f. fluitans</h1>
<p>Alopecurus aequalis f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating mouse-ear chickweed, is a variant of the mouse-ear chickweed species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving water or wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its floating habit is facilitated by a spongy, buoyant stem that allows it to remain afloat on the water's surface.</p>
