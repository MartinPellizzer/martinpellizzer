                <h1>Achras bahamensis</h1>
<p>Achras bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian achiote, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras bahamensis has leaves that are large, broad, and palmate in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically greyish-brown in color. It produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind for pollination.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras bahamensis is primarily native to the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly in the islands of the Bahamas. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing near the shoreline. It is commonly seen in dry, open habitats such as dunes and coastal scrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras bahamensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly the Bahamas, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and slow growth habit.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in coastal areas and gardens for its unique, palm-like structure and its ability to thrive in salty air. Although it is not considered invasive in its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions for landscaping purposes. Its distribution is limited to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant's introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and human activity.</p>
