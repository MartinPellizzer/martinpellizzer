                <h1>Achras bahamensis</h1>
<p>Achras bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian palm, is a flowering plant belonging to the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Bahamas and other parts of the Caribbean, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant features a slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing at the base of the leaves.</p>
<p>The fruit is a round, fibrous structure that contains a single seed, making it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras bahamensis has large, palmate leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is often gray to brown in color. It produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in sandy, coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras bahamensis is a rare palm native to the Bahamas, specifically found on Acklins and Mayaguana islands.</p>
<p>It is now also present in parts of the Florida Keys, likely due to human introduction. This plant thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, often near the shoreline. It grows at low altitudes, typically below 10 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras bahamensis is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean, known for its striking spiky leaves and edible fruits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings often yielding better results due to their higher survival rate. The plant has a long growth cycle, reaching maturity in 3-5 years, and thrives in warm, tropical climates with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or mealybugs in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like mint or basil can help repel pests and enhance its growth.</p>
