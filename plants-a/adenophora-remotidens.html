                <h1>Adenophora remotidens</h1>
<p>Adenophora remotidens, commonly known as the distant-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental beauty and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Adenophora remotidens is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora remotidens has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a straight, branching pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, displaying a pale blue to violet color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora remotidens is primarily native to Korea.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the Korean Peninsula, including both the Korean mainland and the Korean island of Jeju. This plant typically grows in temperate forested areas and mountainous regions where the climate is cool and moist. It is often associated with rocky or sandy soils in these environments.</p>
<p>Adenophora remotidens is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its bell-shaped flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora remotidens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
