<p>Agrostis scaberrima, commonly known as the rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters.</p>
<p>Agrostis scaberrima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
