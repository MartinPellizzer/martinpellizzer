<p>Anguina wawraei, commonly known as the Wawra's anguina, is a species of nematode belonging to the family Anguinidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the roots of certain plants, where it feeds on plant cells, potentially causing damage to the host. This nematode is particularly associated with the genus *Atriplex*, commonly known as saltbushes. Its life cycle involves several stages, including egg, four juvenile stages, and an adult stage.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth and health of its host plants, making it a subject of study in agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
