                    <h1>Astragalus macropus</h1>
<p>Astragalus macropus, commonly known as the large-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Astragalus macropus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
