<p>Agave papyrocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a large, columnar cactus characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny areoles.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that emerge from the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its slow growth and can live for several decades, making it a striking feature of its native habitat.</p>
