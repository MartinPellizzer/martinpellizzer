<p>Acanthocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and are often drought-tolerant, adapted to arid environments. The genus includes several species, such as Acanthocereus tetragonus, which is known for its large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The botanical features of Acanthocereus include areoles, which are clusters of spines, flowers, and sometimes branches.</p>
<p>They are typically shrubs or small trees with a branching structure and are well-suited for xeriscaping due to their low water requirements.</p>
