<p>Arthrostylidium multispicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
