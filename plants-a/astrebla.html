                    <h1>Astrebla</h1>
<p>Astrebla, commonly known as spear grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plants typically produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Astrebla species are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems.</p>
<p>They are sometimes used in revegetation projects due to their resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
