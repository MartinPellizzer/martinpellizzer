                        <h1>Acacia elongata</h1>
<p>Acacia elongata, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, zigzagging stems and small, phyllodes that are typically linear to narrowly elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.
