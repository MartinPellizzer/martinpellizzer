<p>Azolla filiculoides subsp.</p>
<p>cristata, commonly known as the spiked water fern, is a small, floating aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a unique morphology, featuring a rosette-like structure with fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of symbiotic cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spike-like projections on the fronds, which give it its subspecies name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as a food source for various aquatic organisms.</p>
