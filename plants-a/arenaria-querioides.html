                    <h1>Arenaria querioides</h1>
<p>Arenaria querioides, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes or rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
