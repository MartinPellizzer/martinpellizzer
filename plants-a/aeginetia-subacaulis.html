                <h1>Aeginetia subacaulis</h1>
<p>Aeginetia subacaulis, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Africa and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted.</p>
<p>Aeginetia subacaulis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia subacaulis has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows prostrate along the ground, with a pale green color and a slightly hairy surface. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
