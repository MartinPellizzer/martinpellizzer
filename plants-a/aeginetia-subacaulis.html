<p>Aeginetia subacaulis, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Africa and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted.</p>
<p>Aeginetia subacaulis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality.</p>
