                    <h1>Antirrhinum meonanthum var. oreophilum</h1>
<p>Antirrhinum meonanthum var. oreophilum, commonly known as the alpine snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically blooms in late summer and early autumn, adapting to cooler, higher-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
