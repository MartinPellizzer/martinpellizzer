                    <h1>Acacia alleniana</h1>
<p>Acacia alleniana, commonly known as the Allen's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia alleniana is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy soils.</p>
