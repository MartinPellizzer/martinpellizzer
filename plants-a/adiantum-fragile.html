                <h1>Adiantum fragile</h1>
<p>Adiantum fragile, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a delicate and elegant plant belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically light green and have a fragile texture, which is reflected in its common name.</p>
<p>Adiantum fragile is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fragile has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring up to 10 centimeters in length, and are a bright green color, often with a bluish tinge on the underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, clump-forming pattern.

<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fragile is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with rich, humus-filled soil and high humidity. Its distribution includes states like Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It is often seen growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices within forested areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fragile was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly found in regions where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. It is particularly suited for garden settings that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in the wild, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
