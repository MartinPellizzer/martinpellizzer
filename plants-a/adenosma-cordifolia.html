                <h1>Adenosma cordifolia</h1>
<p>Adenosma cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma cordifolia has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five pink to purple petals, blooming during the summer months and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma cordifolia is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. It is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to specific areas within Vietnam's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma cordifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread along coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant is considered a potential weed in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to establish in diverse habitats. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a risk to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora.</p>
<p>Management strategies are being developed to control its spread and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
