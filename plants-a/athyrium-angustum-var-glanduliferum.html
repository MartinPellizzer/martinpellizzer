                    <h1>Athyrium angustum var. glanduliferum</h1>
<p>Athyrium angustum var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the narrow fern with glandular fronds, is a variant of the narrow lady fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
