<p>Acalypha skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's beautyberry, is a shrub native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped berries that appear in clusters. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The berries are a source of food for various birds and small mammals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha skutchii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length and have a slightly hairy texture. The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamens that are longer than the petals, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha skutchii is a species of flowering plant native to Central America, specifically found in parts of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within its native range, where it thrives in tropical moist forests. This plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is typically found in lowland to montane forest habitats. It grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited geographic distribution, Acalypha skutchii is considered a species of concern and may be at risk of extinction in the wild.</p>
