                    <h1>Aristida pallens var. geminata</h1>
<p>Aristida pallens var. geminata, commonly known as the twin-stemmed dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish inflorescences that are often arranged in two rows, giving it its "geminata" designation. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This ornamental grass is valued for its fine texture and ability to blend well into native plant landscapes.</p>
