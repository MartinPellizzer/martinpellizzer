                    <h1>Allium schoenoprasum var. riparium</h1>
<p>Allium schoenoprasum var. riparium, commonly known as water chives, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy areas in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in culinary applications, similar to its common cousin, garlic chives.</p>
