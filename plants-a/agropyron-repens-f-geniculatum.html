<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its low-growing habit and rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a useful plant for erosion control and forage.</p>
