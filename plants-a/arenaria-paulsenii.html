<p>Arenaria paulsenii, commonly known as the Paulsen's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria paulsenii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
