<p>Alopecurus nigricans var. exserens, commonly known as the purple false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators.</p>
