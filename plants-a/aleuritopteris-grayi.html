<p>Aleuritopteris grayi, commonly known as the Gray's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
