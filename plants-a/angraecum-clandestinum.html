                    <h1>Angraecum clandestinum</h1>
<p>Angraecum clandestinum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a deep violet or purple center. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. It produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as hawkmoths.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant-pollinator relationships.</p>
