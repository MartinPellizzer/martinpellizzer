                <h1>Acrostichum excelsum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum excelsum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bi-directionally divided, creating a unique, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and habitat for various organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum excelsum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and feather-like in appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that develops vertical ridges as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and spread out underground to absorb nutrients and moisture.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits a robust, tropical appearance with a distinct morphology adapted to its humid, warm environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum excelsum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including parts of Hawaii, Fiji, and Tahiti.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and moist lowland forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with abundant sunlight and well-drained soil. It is often associated with volcanic soils and can be found growing near sea level.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific island environments where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum excelsum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant thrives in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
