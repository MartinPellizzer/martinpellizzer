                    <h1>Axonopus argentinus f. hirsutus</h1>
<p>Axonopus argentinus f. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy axonopus, is a grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant is native to South America, particularly Argentina, and thrives in moist, shady environments. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread readily, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are wind-pollinated and produce small, dry seeds.</p>
