                    <h1>Anisomeles cuneata</h1>
<p>Anisomeles cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Anisomeles cuneata is often found in coastal dunes and inland sand plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
