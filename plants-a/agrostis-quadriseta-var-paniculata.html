                    <h1>Agrostis quadriseta var. paniculata</h1>
<p>Agrostis quadriseta var. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, ascending stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its fine texture and dense growth make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects.</p>
