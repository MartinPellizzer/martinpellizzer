<p>Avena anathera, commonly known as the spikeless oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafy stems and the absence of the usual awns or bristles found in other oat species. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green color, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Avena anathera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
