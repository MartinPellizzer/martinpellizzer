                    <h1>Agave davillonii</h1>
<p>Agave davillonii, commonly known as the Mexican blue agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is popular among gardeners in dry climates.</p>
