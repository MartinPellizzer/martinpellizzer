                <h1>Achillea pubescens</h1>
<p>Achillea pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and erect, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achillea pubescens is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pubescens has leaves that are basal, with a silver-gray color and a fuzzy texture due to fine hairs, arranged in a rosette formation, and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown color, growing from the base and branching slightly towards the top. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pubescens is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, northwestern Africa, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often found in scrublands and open woodlands. This plant is well adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is commonly seen in areas with poor to moderately fertile soils.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pubescens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. This plant has since spread into nearby natural areas, often establishing itself in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Achillea pubescens is considered an invasive species in some areas where it has become established.</p>
