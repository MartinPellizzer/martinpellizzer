                <h1>Achillea × laggeri</h1>
<p>Achillea × laggeri, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (chamomile yarrow), resulting in a plant with distinctive, feathery foliage. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the central and eastern regions of Europe and is often found in dry meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Achillea × laggeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × laggeri has leaves that are lanceolate to oblanceolate in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rigid, and somewhat woody at the base, with a smooth, dark green bark. Its flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × laggeri is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Alps and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats. It prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as threatened, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a plant of conservation interest.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × laggeri is a hardy perennial plant known for its showy, flat-topped flower heads and silvery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, typically blooming in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune faded flower heads to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs; companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × laggeri is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea × laggeri also offers ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>
