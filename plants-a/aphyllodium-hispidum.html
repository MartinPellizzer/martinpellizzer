<p>Aphyllodium hispidum, commonly known as the hispid sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Aphyllodium hispidum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study in semi-arid environments.</p>
