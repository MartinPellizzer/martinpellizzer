                <h1>Acriopsis indica</h1>
<p>Acriopsis indica, commonly known as the Indian cow parsley, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is native to parts of Asia, including India, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis indica has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are usually green and have a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly hairy bark that is typically greenish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that contains small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis indica is primarily native to the Andaman Is., Assam, Borneo, Cambodia, China South-Central, Jawa, Laos, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, Myanmar, Philippines, Sulawesi, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Acriopsis indica is often associated with mountainous terrain and humid climates.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to diverse ecological conditions in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis indica was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as trade and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, thriving in regions with moderate to warm climates. The plant has shown adaptability to various soil types, which contributes to its successful establishment in non-native regions. It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it also has potential ecological benefits, such as soil stabilization and providing habitat for certain insects.</p>
