                <h1>Acriopsis indica</h1>
<p>Acriopsis indica, commonly known as the Indian cowpea or wild cowpea, is a flowering plant native to southern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in various culinary traditions. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Acriopsis indica is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis indica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are bipinnate, with small, ovate leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense, branched inflorescences, and they bloom in the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis indica is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, including regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution also includes parts of Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, where it has been introduced. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Acriopsis indica is commonly found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and limited threats, it is currently listed as a species of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acriopsis indica is a hardy annual plant commonly grown for its edible leaves and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown directly in the soil or started indoors and transplanted. The growth cycle of Acriopsis indica typically spans four to six months, with rapid growth during the warm season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, requiring consistent moisture but not waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy foliage, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new growth. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
