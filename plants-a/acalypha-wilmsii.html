                        <h1>Acalypha wilmsii</h1>
<p>Acalypha wilmsii, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>Acalypha wilmsii is relatively easy to grow and can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha wilmsii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and are often associated with primitive angiosperm features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as coffee and cotton. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with distinctive floral structures and often produces toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "false hibiscus," characterized by their showy bracts and diverse growth habits.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha wilmsii, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its ornamental value and native to certain regions of South America.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha wilmsii is primarily native to the Cape Provinces, Eswatini, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, and Northern Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forested areas or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the local environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha wilmsii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
