<p>Atriplex pentandra subsp.</p>
<p>confinis, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
