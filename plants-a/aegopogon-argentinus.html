<p>Aegopogon argentinus, commonly known as the Argentine goatweed, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers.

<p>Aegopogon argentinus is an herbaceous perennial that can reach heights of up to 60 cm.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopogon argentinus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a serrated margin.</p>
