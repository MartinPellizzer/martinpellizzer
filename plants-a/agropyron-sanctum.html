                    <h1>Agropyron sanctum</h1>
<p>Agropyron sanctum, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, including Tibet, China, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in harsh conditions, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Agropyron sanctum is also valued for its potential in forage and erosion control in marginal lands.</p>
