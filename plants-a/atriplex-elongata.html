                    <h1>Atriplex elongata</h1>
<p>Atriplex elongata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Atriplex elongata is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes.</p>
