                <h1>Achyrophorus stenocephala</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus stenocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed achyrophorus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in a compact head, and it produces achenes as its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus stenocephala has elongated, narrow leaves that are linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, featuring pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus stenocephala is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to the dry and hot climates typical of these regions. It is an erect perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus stenocephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since become invasive in certain regions of the country. It spreads rapidly through its extensive root system and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
