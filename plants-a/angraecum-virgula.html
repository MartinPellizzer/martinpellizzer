<p>Angraecum virgula, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, white or pale pink flowers that resemble stars, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dark green, strap-like leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in high light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
