                <h1>Aciotis amazonica</h1>
<p>Aciotis amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian aciotis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland and marshy habitats, thriving in humid and warm climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a head.</p>
<p>Aciotis amazonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis amazonica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis amazonica is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. This plant thrives in the dense forests and grasslands of countries such as Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the unique environmental conditions of the Amazon rainforest.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis amazonica was mainly introduced to new habitats in South America, particularly in regions with wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This plant has been observed spreading into adjacent areas, including riparian zones and disturbed sites. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized compared to other invasive plants in the region.</p>
