                <h1>Acnistus lehmannii</h1>
<p>Acnistus lehmannii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a distinguishing feature, and it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acnistus lehmannii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus lehmannii has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure that relies on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus lehmannii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, including the western and southern parts of these countries. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal areas and riverine habitats. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters in height and produces small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also found in disturbed areas and along roadsides in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus lehmannii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in regions with warm, temperate climates. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it a common invasive species in many parts of the world. Its introduction has often been unintentional, through seed dispersal via wind, water, or human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
