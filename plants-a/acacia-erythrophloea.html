                        <h1>Acacia erythrophloea</h1>
<p>Acacia erythrophloea, commonly known as the red-flowered acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow to orange globular inflorescences, which are highly attractive to bees and other pollinators. Its flowers are followed by flat, fibrous pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia erythrophloea is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia erythrophloea is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of habitats, including savannas, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This species is commonly found in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate. It plays an important ecological role in its native range by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia erythrophloea is also known for its ability to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia erythrophloea was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can form dense thickets, altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal through animals and wind contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on biodiversity.</p>
