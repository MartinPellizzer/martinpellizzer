                    <h1>Acacia harala</h1>
<p>Acacia harala, commonly known as the Harala acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, slender trunk and dense, feathery foliage composed of phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of leaves. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and extreme climates.</p>
<p>Acacia harala is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance in some local communities.</p>
