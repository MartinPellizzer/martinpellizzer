<p>Aloe kraussii, commonly known as the red aloe or red-stemmed aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products.</p>
<p>Aloe kraussii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
