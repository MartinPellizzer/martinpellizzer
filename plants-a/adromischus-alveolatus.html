<p>Adromischus alveolatus, commonly known as the "Coral Cactus," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded shape with dense clusters of small, fleshy, spineless stems. The plant produces bright red to orange flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are often mistaken for flowers due to their similar color and shape.</p>
<p>Adromischus alveolatus is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
