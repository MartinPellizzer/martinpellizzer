<p>Aspidium elatior, commonly known as the greater wall rue, is a fern native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in woodland areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Aspidium elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
