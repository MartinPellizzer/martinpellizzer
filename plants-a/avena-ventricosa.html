                    <h1>Avena ventricosa</h1>
<p>Avena ventricosa, commonly known as the burr oat or smooth oat, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in bracts. Avena ventricosa thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts.</p>
