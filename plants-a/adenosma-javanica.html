                <h1>Adenosma javanica</h1>
<p>Adenosma javanica, commonly known as the Java adenostemon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and have five petals, often with a distinctive yellowish or white color.</p>
<p>Adenosma javanica is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream sides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma javanica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a pale green to brownish bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in terminal spikes, with pale yellow to orange petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma javanica is primarily native to Borneo, Cambodia, Caroline Is., Hainan, Jawa, Laos, Malaya, Myanmar, Philippines, Sumatera, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This flowering plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or along riverbanks. The species is known for its small, clustered flowers and is part of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans a wide range of Southeast Asian islands and mainland countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma javanica was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or plant materials. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species, it poses a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further invasion.</p>
