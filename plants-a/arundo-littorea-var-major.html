                    <h1>Arundo littorea var. major</h1>
<p>Arundo littorea var. major, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found along riverbanks and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
