                <h1>Adenophora smithii</h1>
<p>Adenophora smithii, commonly known as the Smith's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Adenophora smithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora smithii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five petals, and are usually pink to purple in color, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora smithii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. This species thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with coniferous forests and can be found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Adenophora smithii plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora smithii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. This plant has been documented in several states including Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in these environments.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas.</p>
