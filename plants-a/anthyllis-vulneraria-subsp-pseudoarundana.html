<p>Anthyllis vulneraria subsp.</p>
<p>pseudoarundana, commonly known as the yellow sweet clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many legumes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a creeping growth habit with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
