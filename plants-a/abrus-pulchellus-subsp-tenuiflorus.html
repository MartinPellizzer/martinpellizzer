<p>tenuiflorus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in secondary forests, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. It is known for its distinctive red and black seed pods, which are often used in traditional practices.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is closely linked to its ability to adapt to a variety of soil types and environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus pulchellus subsp.</p>
<p>tenuiflorus was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive red flowers.</p>
<p>However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
