                <h1>Adina rubescens</h1>
<p>Adina rubescens, commonly known as red adina, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and reddish underneath, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in tropical gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina rubescens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 3â€“6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina rubescens is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests, secondary growth areas, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Adina rubescens is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and northern Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina rubescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive red foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread.</p>
