                <h1>Acorus floridanus</h1>
<p>Acorus floridanus, commonly known as the Florida sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, often submerged or partially emergent in wetlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense spikes, which appear in the spring and summer months. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Acorus floridanus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus floridanus has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged in a fan-like pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, pale green surface, and grows from rhizomes that spread horizontally underground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered spikes during the spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that disperses its seeds by water, as the seeds are lightweight and buoyant.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in wet, muddy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus floridanus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including Florida, Georgia, and parts of the Carolinas.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies such as ponds and lakes. This plant is commonly found in swamps and riparian zones where the soil remains consistently moist. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Acorus floridanus is also occasionally cultivated in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus floridanus was mainly introduced to Florida, particularly in wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant has been established in the Everglades and other southern regions of the United States. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to improve water quality.</p>
