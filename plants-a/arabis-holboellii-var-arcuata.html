<p>Arabis holboellii var. arcuata, commonly known as the bent-leaved rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that curve inward, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
