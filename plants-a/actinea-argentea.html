                <h1>Actinea argentea</h1>
<p>Actinea argentea, commonly known as silver actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent tentacles that give it a shimmering appearance. The polyp's body is typically pale or silver in color, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in shallow, coastal waters and is often found in association with coral reefs.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea argentea has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray upper surface and a darker green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea argentea is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments, particularly in marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species is commonly found in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the balance of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often associated with areas that have stable water levels and nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea argentea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which are common in forested regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
