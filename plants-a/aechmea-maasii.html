                <h1>Aechmea maasii</h1>
<p>Aechmea maasii, commonly known as the Maas's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's foliage is often adorned with vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. Aechmea maasii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea maasii has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and leathery, with a dark green color and a waxy coating, arranged in a tight spiral at the base.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, compact rosette with a central inflorescence that is covered in dense, spiky bracts. Its flowers are striking, with bright red bracts that enclose small, yellowish-white flowers, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a berry that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through bird ingestion and excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, typical of epiphytic growth.</p>
