                    <h1>Acacia ruddiae</h1>
<p>Acacia ruddiae, commonly known as the Cape York acacia, is a shrub native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and phyllodes that are typically straight or slightly curved. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which appear during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many acacia species, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia ruddiae is well adapted to drought and is often found in sandy soils across its native range.</p>
