<p>Albertinia polycephala, commonly known as the many-headed grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to form extensive mats on the ground. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
