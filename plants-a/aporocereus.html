<p>Aporocereus, commonly known as the night bloomer or star cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habits, producing large, fragrant flowers that open at night. Aporocereus species typically have a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Their flowers are often white or pale in color, with a star-like appearance, hence the common name.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Aporocereus tetragonus, which is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its ornamental value.</p>
