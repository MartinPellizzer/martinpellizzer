                <h1>Acer monspessulanum var. rotundilobum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. rotundilobum, commonly known as the rounded-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically rounded at the base and have five to seven lobes. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape. It produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. rotundilobum has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a lobed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green during the growing season and turning red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and often multi-branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in drooping clusters, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the tree has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. rotundilobum is a rare variant of the downy maple native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Portugal and northern Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the montane regions of these areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. rotundilobum is a compact, slow-growing maple known for its rounded leaves and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. This variety thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil, with moderate watering to avoid waterlogging. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and remove any dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, making it a good companion plant for lavender or ornamental grasses.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. rotundilobum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby species through its dense root system. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root network that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting local insect populations.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. rotundilobum is a lesser-known maple species with limited culinary use, though its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>In medicinal applications, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability, supporting wildlife habitats. Culturally, it is appreciated in botanic gardens and conservation efforts, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ornamental horticulture also enhances landscape design in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. rotundilobum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their striking fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. Hybrid forms often combine the hardiness of Acer monspessulanum with the vibrant foliage of other maple species. These hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their adaptability to various climates and their aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>Overall, the cultivars and hybrids of this variety play a significant role in the ornamental horticulture industry.</p>
