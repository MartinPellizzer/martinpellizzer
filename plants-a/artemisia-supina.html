                    <h1>Artemisia supina</h1>
<p>Artemisia supina, commonly known as creeping wormwood, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray, aromatic foliage with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in summer, contributing to its role in pollination. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally avoided in herbal remedies due to its strong, bitter taste.</p>
