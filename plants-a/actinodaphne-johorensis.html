<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces drupes that are typically reddish or yellowish when mature, and it is often found in lowland to hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne johorensis has elliptical to ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age.
