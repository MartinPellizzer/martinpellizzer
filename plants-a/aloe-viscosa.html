                    <h1>Aloe viscosa</h1>
<p>Aloe viscosa, commonly known as tree aloe or African aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom on a tall, branched stem, typically during the summer months. Aloe viscosa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its gel-like pulp is sometimes used in traditional medicine and skincare products.</p>
