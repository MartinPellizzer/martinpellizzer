                <h1>Adelmeria albida</h1>
<p>Adelmeria albida, commonly known as the white-flowered manzanita, is a shrub native to California and southern Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Adelmeria albida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelmeria albida has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are white and bell-shaped, clustered in inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria albida is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and coastal bluffs along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, Mediterranean climate of its native range. It is often associated with chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria albida was mainly introduced to coastal areas of southern California, particularly in regions with sandy soils and mild, Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers and compact growth habit. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed sites and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
