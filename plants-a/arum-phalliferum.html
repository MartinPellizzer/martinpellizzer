                    <h1>Arum phalliferum</h1>
<p>Arum phalliferum, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a broad, petal-like spathe. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decay, which serves to attract its primary pollinatorsâ€”flies and beetles. Its botanical structure includes a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients and water, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Arum phalliferum is also notable for its unique reproductive strategy, where the spadix generates heat to enhance the release of its odor and facilitate pollination.</p>
