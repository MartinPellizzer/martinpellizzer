<p>Angraecum arachnopus, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a unique, elongated spur. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, producing delicate white or pale pink blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
