                <h1>Achimenes cochinchinensis</h1>
<p>Achimenes cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, featuring upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes cochinchinensis has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green, with a slightly woody texture, and it grows upright with a trailing habit. Its flowers are tubular with a spurred lip, coming in shades of pink to red, and they bloom from summer to autumn, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes cochinchinensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream sides. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with lowland and hill forest ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and northern Malaysia.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes cochinchinensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for its ornamental value due to its showy flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal. It has been reported to outcompete native plants in wetland and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
