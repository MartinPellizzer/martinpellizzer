                    <h1>Argemone mexicana var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Argemone mexicana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly prickly poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with prominent, red-orange anthers that release a pungent, toxic sap. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to disperse the seeds, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
