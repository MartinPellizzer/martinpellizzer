<p>Arrhenatherum elatius var. sardoum, commonly known as Sardinian feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces dense, light green foliage with inflorescences that are panicle-like and often tinged with reddish hues. It is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical A. elatius by its unique morphological features and geographic distribution.</p>
