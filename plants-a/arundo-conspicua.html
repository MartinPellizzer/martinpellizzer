                    <h1>Arundo conspicua</h1>
<p>Arundo conspicua, commonly known as the showy reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features striking, silver-green leaves with a distinctive white stripe running along the midrib. The plant produces dense clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardens and wetland restoration.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
