<p>Asplenium nesii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Madeira.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices.
