<p>Asclepias grandiflora, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is toxic to some animals. Its flowers are pollinated by butterflies, particularly the monarch butterfly, which relies on it as a host plant for its larvae.</p>
<p>Asclepias grandiflora plays an important role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
