                    <h1>Acacia lumholtzii</h1>
<p>Acacia lumholtzii, commonly known as the Texas acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia lumholtzii is well adapted to drought and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
