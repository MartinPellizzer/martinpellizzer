                    <h1>Asplenium excelsum</h1>
<p>Asplenium excelsum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
