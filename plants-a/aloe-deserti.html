                    <h1>Aloe deserti</h1>
<p>Aloe deserti, commonly known as the desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. It produces yellow or orange flowers on tall, branched stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
