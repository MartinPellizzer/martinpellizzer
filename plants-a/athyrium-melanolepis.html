<p>Athyrium melanolepis, commonly known as the black-stemmed lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are typically released during the summer months.</p>
