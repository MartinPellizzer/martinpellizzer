<p>Acianthera cerberus, commonly known as the Cerberus orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and vibrant, often purple or reddish petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are designed to attract specific pollinators, primarily bees and wasps, through specialized scent and color patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
