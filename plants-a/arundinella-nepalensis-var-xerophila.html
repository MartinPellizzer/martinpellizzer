                    <h1>Arundinella nepalensis var. xerophila</h1>
<p>Arundinella nepalensis var. xerophila, commonly known as the Nepalese reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting xerophytic adaptations such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps that stabilize soil in rocky or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological resilience and potential use in sustainable land management practices.</p>
