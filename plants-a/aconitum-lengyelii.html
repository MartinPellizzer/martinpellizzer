                <h1>Aconitum lengyelii</h1>
<p>Aconitum lengyelii, commonly known as the Hungarian aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers. The flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with five petals and numerous stamens, and are borne in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that are deeply lobed, giving the plant a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it a dangerous species to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lengyelii has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a broad, upright arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, forming dense clusters at the top of the plant, with a spurred petal structure, and they bloom in late summer, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often forming a caudex that helps the plant survive in harsh conditions.</p>
