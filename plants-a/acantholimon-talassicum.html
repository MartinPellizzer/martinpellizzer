                        <h1>Acantholimon talassicum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon talassicum, commonly known as the coastal thornsteppe, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is often considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon talassicum is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California, particularly in the Santa Barbara Channel and the Channel Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with moderate wave action. This plant is commonly found in maritime scrub and dune habitats, where it is adapted to salt spray and well-drained conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon talassicum was mainly introduced to coastal and saline environments, particularly in regions with high salt content in the soil.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with moderate to high salinity, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and salt marshes. This plant is commonly found in the Mediterranean region, as well as parts of western and southern Europe. Its introduction has been largely due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
