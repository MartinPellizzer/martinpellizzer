                    <h1>Avenastrum hackelii</h1>
<p>Avenastrum hackelii, commonly known as the desert wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Avenastrum hackelii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats.</p>
