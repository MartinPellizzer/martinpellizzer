                <h1>Aegiphila membranacea</h1>
<p>Aegiphila membranacea, commonly known as the membranous aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color.</p>
<p>Aegiphila membranacea is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila membranacea has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes whitish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>
