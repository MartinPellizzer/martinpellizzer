                <h1>Adhatoda major</h1>
<p>Adhatoda major, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a perennial shrub native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported respiratory benefits.</p>
<p>Adhatoda major thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda major has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically blue or violet in color, blooming from April to September, and are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda major is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is also present in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Kenya. It thrives in humid climates and is often associated with riverine and forested areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution includes both the Indian subcontinent and parts of eastern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda major was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental and medicinal value.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Africa for its therapeutic properties. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed ecosystems. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is needed to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
