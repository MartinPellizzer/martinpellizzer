                    <h1>Allocarya undulata</h1>
<p>Allocarya undulata, commonly known as the undulating lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterium, which contributes to its ability to photosynthesize. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure makes it sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
