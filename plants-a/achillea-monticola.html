                <h1>Achillea monticola</h1>
<p>Achillea monticola, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for alpine gardens. Its feathery leaves and delicate flowers make it an attractive addition to wildflower displays.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea monticola has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a basal rosette and ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rough to the touch, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a compact, bushy form. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind after the flowers dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea monticola is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, dry, and rocky habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 6,000 feet. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of forests. It is also present in parts of northern Mexico, including Baja California.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the unique climatic conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea monticola was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its bright yellow flowers attracting pollinators. However, its invasive nature has led to its spread beyond intended areas, sometimes displacing native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
