                <h1>Adenia olaboensis</h1>
<p>Adenia olaboensis, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae, which includes many species with showy flowers. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the stems are woody with a distinctive, often hairy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a green, fleshy berry that ripens to a yellowish color and is edible.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia olaboensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically a dull brown or grayish color, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. The flowers are large, showy, and have a complex structure with five petals, displaying a vibrant pink to red color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store water and nutrients in its native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia olaboensis is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the humid lowland forests. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is often found growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia olaboensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and consistent moisture, making it suitable for gardens and greenhouses in warmer climates. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly its striking flowers and foliage. It is commonly found in the wild in parts of Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>
