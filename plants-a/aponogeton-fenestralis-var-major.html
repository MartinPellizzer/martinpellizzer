<p>Aponogeton fenestralis var. major, commonly known as the giant water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it float on water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which can impact water flow and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
