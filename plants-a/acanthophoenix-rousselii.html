                    <h1>Acanthophoenix rousselii</h1>
<p>Acanthophoenix rousselii, commonly known as the Socotra palm, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and a slender, unbranched trunk that can grow up to 15 meters tall. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to the arid and rocky environment of its native habitat. Its leaves are feather-like and can reach lengths of up to three meters, providing shade and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The Socotra palm is also notable for its unusual fruit, which contains a single seed surrounded by a fibrous pulp.</p>
