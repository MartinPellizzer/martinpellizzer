                <h1>Achillea gilva</h1>
<p>Achillea gilva, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and rocky environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed.</p>
<p>Achillea gilva is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea gilva has narrow, linear leaves that are usually blue-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a grayish-green color, with a slightly hairy texture, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea gilva is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, and parts of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across Europe, including the Mediterranean basin, and has been introduced to other areas outside its native range. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea gilva is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, as it is relatively widespread and adaptable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea gilva is a low-growing perennial plant known for its fluffy, yellow flowers and hardy nature, commonly used in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring or fall. The growth cycle of Achillea gilva involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning back dead foliage after flowering helps maintain its compact form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea gilva is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its yellow flowers, supporting biodiversity in local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea gilva also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting a healthier environment for other flora and fauna.</p>
