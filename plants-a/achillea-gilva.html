                <h1>Achillea gilva</h1>
<p>Achillea gilva, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Achillea gilva is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea gilva has narrow, linear leaves that are usually blue-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is often丛生 (clumping). The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea gilva is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Italy, and France.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa and western Asia, often found in disturbed or rocky soils. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as slopes, grasslands, and along roadsides. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Achillea gilva is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not at immediate risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea gilva is a low-growing perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, yellow or white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea gilva involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
