                <h1>Adiantum atroviride</h1>
<p>Adiantum atroviride, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum atroviride is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities in indoor settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum atroviride has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a slender, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically triangular in shape, with a dark green color and a metallic sheen, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows vertically. Adiantum atroviride is a spore-bearing plant, so it does not produce flowers or fruits; instead, it reproduces via spores released from the sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant to its substrate, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum atroviride is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, and Queensland.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in rocky outcrops and open woodland habitats across these regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen growing on limestone or sandstone. The plant is known for its delicate, fern-like fronds that display a striking dark green color.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific areas within these Australian states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum atroviride was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses, where it is appreciated for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it suitable for woodland gardens and rockeries. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has the potential to spread into natural areas if not properly managed.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in certain regions.</p>
