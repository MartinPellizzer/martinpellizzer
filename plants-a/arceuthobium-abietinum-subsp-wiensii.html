                    <h1>Arceuthobium abietinum subsp. wiensii</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium abietinum subsp.</p>
<p>wiensii, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects coniferous trees such as firs and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming dense clusters on the branches.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with the host, including the release of seeds via a mechanism called autochory.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
