                <h1>Adenostemma roylei</h1>
<p>Adenostemma roylei, commonly known as the Indian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and sometimes glandular. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Adenostemma roylei is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma roylei has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright and branching sparsely. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma roylei is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Pakistan, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in open grasslands and along roadsides. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to warm, dry climates. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Adenostemma roylei is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma roylei was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats with poor soil conditions. The plant is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic weed in native ecosystems.</p>
