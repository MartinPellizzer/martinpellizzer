                    <h1>Avenula delicatula</h1>
<p>Avenula delicatula, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as along stream banks and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Avenula delicatula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
