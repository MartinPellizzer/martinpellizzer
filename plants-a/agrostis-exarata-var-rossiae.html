                    <h1>Agrostis exarata var. rossiae</h1>
<p>Agrostis exarata var. rossiae, commonly known as Ross's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
