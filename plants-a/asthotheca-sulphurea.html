                    <h1>Asthotheca sulphurea</h1>
<p>Asthotheca sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur cup lichen, is a member of the family Xanthopsoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, yellowish to orange-brown coating on rock surfaces, particularly in arid or semi-arid environments. The lichen's thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>The sulfur cup lichen is notable for its vivid coloration, which is due to the presence of pigments produced by the algal component.</p>
