<p>Aa macra, commonly known as the red hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are five-petaled and showy.</p>
<p>Aa macra thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aa macra has leaves that are broad, ovate, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a deep green color and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that develops deep fissures as the plant matures, and it grows in a bushy, upright pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aa macra is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including tropical and subtropical regions with suitable climates. This plant thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland rainforests or along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes below 1,000 meters, preferring warm and moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, the conservation status of Aa macra is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aa macra is a hardy, perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aa macra is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring vegetation by improving soil health. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, aa macra contributes to nutrient cycling by acting as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the surrounding environment.</p>
