                <h1>Achillea obristii</h1>
<p>Achillea obristii, commonly known as the Balkan yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Achillea obristii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea obristii has basal, linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, hairy achene that is dispersed by wind due to its lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
