                    <h1>Agrostis signata var. limosa</h1>
<p>Agrostis signata var. limosa, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes contributes to its ecological significance in coastal environments.</p>
