<p>Aster glaucophyllus, commonly known as the blueleaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with blue to violet petals and yellow centers, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the thick coating of trichomes.</p>
<p>Aster glaucophyllus is well adapted to moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas.</p>
