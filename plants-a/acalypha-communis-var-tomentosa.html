                        <h1>Acalypha communis var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Acalypha communis var. tomentosa, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or reddish in color.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha communis var. tomentosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is frequently associated with forest understories or disturbed sites. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across parts of Oceania and the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha communis var. tomentosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can form dense stands that alter habitat structure.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
