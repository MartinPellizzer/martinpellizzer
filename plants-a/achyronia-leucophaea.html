                <h1>Achyronia leucophaea</h1>
<p>Achyronia leucophaea, commonly known as the white-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including insects and mammals. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and butterflies, contributing to its role in pollination.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia leucophaea has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia leucophaea is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from Virginia to Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in coastal dunes and other sandy habitats. It is often associated with maritime ecosystems and is well adapted to salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where these environmental conditions are met.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia leucophaea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several states across the eastern United States, including Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land clearing and transportation corridors.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
