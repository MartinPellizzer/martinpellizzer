                    <h1>Arundo littorea</h1>
<p>Arundo littorea, commonly known as coastal reed or marsh reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This plant thrives in wet or brackish environments, such as marshes, estuaries, and coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Arundo littorea is also valued for its ability to filter water and reduce erosion in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
