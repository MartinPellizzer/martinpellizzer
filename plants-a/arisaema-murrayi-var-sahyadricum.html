<p>Arisaema murrayi var. sahyadricum, commonly known as the Sahyadri arisaema, is a rare and unique member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Western Ghats of India, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features a distinctive leaf structure with a broad, heart-shaped leaf and a spadix that produces both male and female flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a thick, tuberous rhizome and a striking, hooded spathe that protects the spadix.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
