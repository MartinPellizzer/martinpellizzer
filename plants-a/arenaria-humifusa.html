<p>Arenaria humifusa, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arenaria humifusa is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
