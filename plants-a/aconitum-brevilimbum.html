                <h1>Aconitum brevilimbum</h1>
<p>Aconitum brevilimbum, commonly known as the short-limbed monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with a distinctive velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum brevilimbum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape and ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spathaceous inflorescences, with spurred petals and a short, tubular base, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum brevilimbum is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude regions of this region, typically in mountainous areas with cool and moist climates. This species thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Tibet.</p>
<p>It is an important plant in the local flora and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum brevilimbum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated gardens, establishing itself in natural habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. This distribution is largely attributed to its adaptability and the lack of natural predators or diseases in its new range. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
