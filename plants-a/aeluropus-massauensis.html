<p>Aeluropus massauensis, commonly known as the Saharan grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Aeluropus massauensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
