                <h1>Aeluropus massauensis</h1>
<p>Aeluropus massauensis, commonly known as the Saharan grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Aeluropus massauensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus massauensis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear, arranged in a basal rosette, and range in length from 5 to 15 centimeters with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a low, spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white inflorescences composed of spikelets, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-angled capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after maturation.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or saline soils.</p>
