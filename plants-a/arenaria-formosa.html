<p>Arenaria formosa, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria formosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
