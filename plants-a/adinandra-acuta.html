<p>Adinandra acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf tallow tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Adinandra acuta is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra acuta has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a branched structure. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and consist of five white petals and stamens; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra acuta is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula. It thrives in humid lowland rainforests, often growing as an understory plant in dense vegetation. Adinandra acuta is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and deforestation, it is currently listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra acuta is a fast-growing, evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in tropical climates.</p>
