<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
