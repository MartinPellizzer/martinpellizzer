                <h1>Acineta mireyae</h1>
<p>Acineta mireyae, commonly known as the Mireyae's acineta, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems, adapting to its specific ecological niche. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta mireyae has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow ridges as the plant matures. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind due to their lack of showy petals. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta mireyae is primarily native to Panama.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in areas with moist, shaded habitats. It is commonly associated with cloud forests and humid lowland areas. The plant's distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Panama's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta mireyae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, quarries, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of southern Europe, and North Africa. Its introduction has been linked to human activities, including land clearing and transportation networks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
