                <h1>Adinandra donnaiensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra donnaiensis, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra donnaiensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra donnaiensis is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas. It is commonly observed in the northern and central parts of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with humid and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra donnaiensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and naturalized settings. This plant is often found in lowland forests and along stream banks where it can receive adequate moisture. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated for both ecological and aesthetic purposes.</p>
