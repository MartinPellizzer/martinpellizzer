                <h1>Acer oxyodon</h1>
<p>Acer oxyodon, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer oxyodon is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with greenish-yellow petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the light, feathery structure of the wings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the tree firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas such as Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where it thrives in temperate climates. Currently, the distribution of Acer oxyodon is limited, with only a few scattered populations remaining in its original habitat. It prefers moist, well-drained soils in forested areas at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, Acer oxyodon is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon is a rare and ornamental maple tree known for its unique foliage and slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer oxyodon is typically slow, with significant growth occurring during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal to avoid damaging its sensitive roots, and pruning is best done in early spring to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or fungal infections in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant plants can help improve its growing environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, aiding in the reproduction of the tree and other nearby plants. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex food web. The tree also contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, its leaves decompose to enrich the soil, offering ecological benefits that support plant growth and nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon is a rare and lesser-known maple species that has limited direct uses in culinary applications due to its small size and low fruit production.</p>
<p>However, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for small-scale woodworking and carving. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some indigenous practices for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and ornamental than industrial, contributing to biodiversity and habitat support in its native environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are noted for their striking yellow leaves and variegated foliage. Hybrids of Acer oxyodon are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and public gardens to add visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
