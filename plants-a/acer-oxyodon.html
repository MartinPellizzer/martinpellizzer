                <h1>Acer oxyodon</h1>
<p>Acer oxyodon, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically have five lobes and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Acer oxyodon is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven pointed lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are medium in size, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green in summer and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is slender and grows upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, making it a species of significant ecological interest. It thrives in cool, humid environments, often found in dense forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer oxyodon is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer oxyodon includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion plants like lavender or marigold to deter insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other plants. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and supports local ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon is a rare maple species primarily known for its ornamental value in horticulture due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in some indigenous cultures. The wood of Acer oxyodon is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for carving and furniture-making. It holds cultural significance in certain regions, where it is symbolized as a representation of resilience and growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it also plays a role in ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oxyodon has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', known for their striking yellow and variegated foliage. Hybrids of Acer oxyodon are often created to enhance traits like cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in landscaping and public gardens for their unique visual characteristics.</p>
