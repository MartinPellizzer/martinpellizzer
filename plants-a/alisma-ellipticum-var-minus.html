                    <h1>Alisma ellipticum var. minus</h1>
<p>Alisma ellipticum var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is often distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaves and smaller stature.</p>
