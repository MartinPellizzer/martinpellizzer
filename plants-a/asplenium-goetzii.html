<p>Asplenium goetzii, commonly known as the Goetz's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks.</p>
<p>Asplenium goetzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
