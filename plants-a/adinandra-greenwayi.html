                <h1>Adinandra greenwayi</h1>
<p>Adinandra greenwayi, commonly known as the Greenway's adenium, is a unique shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of small, waxy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adinandra greenwayi is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra greenwayi has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and periodic drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra greenwayi is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in the understory where it receives dappled sunlight. This species thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained, fertile soils. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within its native range.</p>
<p>Adinandra greenwayi plays a role in the ecological dynamics of these forests, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra greenwayi was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and lowland forests. This plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction has been noted in botanical gardens and conservation areas where it is cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, its spread in the wild is limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
