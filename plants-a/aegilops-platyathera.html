                <h1>Aegilops platyathera</h1>
<p>Aegilops platyathera, commonly known as the flat-awned goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia, characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets, and its seeds are enclosed in narrow, awn-tipped glumes. Aegilops platyathera is notable for its genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs due to its potential for improving disease resistance and yield.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes serving as a forage plant and a habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops platyathera has narrow, elongated leaves that are grass-like in appearance, with a bluish-green color and parallel venation, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
