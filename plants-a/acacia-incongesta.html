<p>Acacia incongesta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Acacia incongesta is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Its wood is lightweight and has been traditionally used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes.</p>
