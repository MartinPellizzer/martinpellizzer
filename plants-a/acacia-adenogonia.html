                    <h1>Acacia adenogonia</h1>
<p>Acacia adenogonia, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Acacia adenogonia is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
