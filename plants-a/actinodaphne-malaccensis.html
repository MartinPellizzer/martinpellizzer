                <h1>Actinodaphne malaccensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca camphor tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers, which are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne malaccensis has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, fragrant, and clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, ovoid drupe that turns dark purple when mature, dispersing primarily by birds through seed ingestion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne malaccensis is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the Malay Peninsula. This plant thrives in humid, lowland forests with well-drained soil. It is commonly encountered in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is restricted to specific habitats within Malaya.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne malaccensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant due to its attractive foliage. Its introduction has been associated with horticultural trade and cultural exchange between regions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
