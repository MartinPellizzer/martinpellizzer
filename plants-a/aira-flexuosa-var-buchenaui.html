<p>Aira flexuosa var. buchenaui, commonly known as the Buchenau's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
