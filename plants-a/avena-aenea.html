                    <h1>Avena aenea</h1>
<p>Avena aenea, commonly known as silver oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Avena aenea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
