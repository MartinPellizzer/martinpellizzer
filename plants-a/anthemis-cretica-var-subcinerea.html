                    <h1>Anthemis cretica var. subcinerea</h1>
<p>Anthemis cretica var. subcinerea, commonly known as the silver anthemion, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening.</p>
