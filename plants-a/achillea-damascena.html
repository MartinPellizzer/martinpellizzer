<p>Achillea damascena, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to golden orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces feathery, aromatic leaves that are often used in herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its dried flowers are used in perfumes and as a fragrance fixative due to their long-lasting scent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea damascena has compound, finely divided leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fern-like shape and a feathery texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters of small, bright yellow to orange-red blooms, with ray florets and disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea damascena is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is now widely cultivated and naturalized in temperate regions around the world, particularly in gardens and disturbed soils. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations are sometimes threatened by habitat loss and urban development.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea damascena is a hardy perennial known for its fragrant, yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
