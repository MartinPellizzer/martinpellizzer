                <h1>Acrostichum lastii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lastii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy cortex. Its reproductive structures include both strobili and spores, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Acrostichum lastii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lastii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are feather-like in appearance, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in the late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lastii is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and moist lowland forests. This fern thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. It is often seen growing near mangroves and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific islands in the Caribbean, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lastii was mainly introduced to urban and industrial areas due to its tolerance of polluted environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along roadsides, in waste areas, and near construction sites. This plant has adapted well to disturbed soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Its ability to grow in harsh conditions makes it a pioneer species in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
