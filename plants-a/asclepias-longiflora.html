                    <h1>Asclepias longiflora</h1>
<p>Asclepias longiflora, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spherical seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, and it contains a milky sap that is toxic to many animals.</p>
<p>Asclepias longiflora plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
