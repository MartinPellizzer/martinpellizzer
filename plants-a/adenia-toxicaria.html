                <h1>Adenia toxicaria</h1>
<p>Adenia toxicaria, commonly known as the poison apple or deadly nightshade, is a striking plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are highly toxic but visually appealing. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and showy floral structures that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia toxicaria has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it grows as an upright shrub. Its flowers are large, showy, and have a complex structure with five petals, ranging in color from yellow to orange, blooming during the wet season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia toxicaria is primarily native to eastern and southeastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and sand dunes, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with coastal vegetation and can be found in open woodlands or heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by livestock and humans, though it plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia toxicaria was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant was likely introduced through accidental means, such as being carried in soil or on vehicles. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
