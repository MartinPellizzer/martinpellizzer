                    <h1>Aceratium tomentosum</h1>
<p>Aceratium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Aceratium tomentosum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
