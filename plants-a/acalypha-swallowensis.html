<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha swallowensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes fissured with age, and exhibit a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with five pinkish-white petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
