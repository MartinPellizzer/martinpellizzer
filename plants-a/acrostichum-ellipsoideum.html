<p>Acrostichum ellipsoideum, commonly known as the broad-leafed brake, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acrostichum ellipsoideum is often found in wetlands, forests, and along stream banks.</p>
