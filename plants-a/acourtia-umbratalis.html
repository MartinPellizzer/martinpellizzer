                <h1>Acourtia umbratalis</h1>
<p>Acourtia umbratalis, commonly known as the shadowy acourtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acourtia umbratalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia umbratalis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a sprawling, trailing pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia umbratalis is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in the region encompassing the central and southern parts of Mexico. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments within these areas. The plant is adapted to the specific climate and soil conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these regions, reflecting its ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia umbratalis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it well-suited for temperate climates. The plant is particularly common in areas with rich organic soil, which supports its growth and reproduction. Its introduction has been documented in several regions where it has established itself as a non-native species.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements and the absence of natural dispersal agents in new environments.</p>
