<p>Acourtia umbratalis, commonly known as the shadowy acourtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acourtia umbratalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
