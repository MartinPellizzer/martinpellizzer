                <h1>Acer hookeri var. normale</h1>
<p>Acer hookeri var. normale, commonly known as the Hooker's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hookeri var. normale has palmately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hookeri var. normale is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, where it grows in shaded, moist forest understories. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hookeri var. normale is a hardy deciduous shrub known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like heather or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hookeri var. normale is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hookeri var. normale is a lesser-known plant species primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture due to its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it may have potential in traditional medicine for its possible anti-inflammatory properties. Its role in industrial and economic contexts is minimal, as it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. Culturally, it may hold significance in local traditions or as a symbol of natural beauty in certain regions.</p>
<p>Overall, its main application remains in botanical gardens and as a subject of ecological study.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hookeri var. normale has a limited number of cultivated varieties, with several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Sutherlandii' being widely appreciated for their vibrant foliage colors.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly hybridized due to its specific genetic traits, some horticulturalists have attempted crosses with other maple species to enhance ornamental features. Its horticultural importance lies in its unique leaf patterns and autumn coloration, making it a sought-after specimen in gardens and collections. Despite its beauty, it remains a relatively rare plant in cultivation, often favored by enthusiasts and specialists.</p>
<p>Its limited availability underscores its value in both landscape design and botanical research.</p>
