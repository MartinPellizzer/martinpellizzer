<p>barrelieri has basal, herbaceous leaves that are lanceolate or linear in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern. The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark, growing from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>barrelieri is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern France, Italy, and parts of Spain. Currently, it is also distributed in North Africa, including countries like Morocco and Algeria.</p>
<p>This species thrives in dry, rocky environments and is commonly found in coastal areas and limestone soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>barrelieri is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental yellow flowers and drought-tolerant nature. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. The plant has a summer growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
