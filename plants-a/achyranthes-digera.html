                <h1>Achyranthes digera</h1>
<p>Achyranthes digera, commonly known as Indian knotgrass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a slender, erect stem that branches towards the upper part. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a hairy surface. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes digera has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 3–8 cm long and 1–3 cm wide, with a slightly hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale green to yellowish bracts, and they bloom from June to September, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes digera is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist environments like riverbanks, marshes, and wetlands. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed soils. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Americas, though its native range is mainly concentrated in Asia.</p>
<p>Its adaptability allows it to spread to various regions beyond its original habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes digera was mainly introduced to areas where it can thrive in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often as an invasive weed. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in several regions due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>It is now considered a problematic species in many parts of the world.</p>
