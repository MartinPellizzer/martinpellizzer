                <h1>Achyranthes digera</h1>
<p>Achyranthes digera, commonly known as the small eryngo, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry wastelands. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Achyranthes digera is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes digera has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. The small greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose spikes, bloom from June to September, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp that splits into three parts, each containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes digera is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Asia, including regions such as India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in open habitats like fields, roadsides, and wastelands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns for local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
