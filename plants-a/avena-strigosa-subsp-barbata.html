<p>Avena strigosa subsp.</p>
<p>barbata, commonly known as the barbed oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bracted florets, which are often adorned with short, barbed hairs. These hairs aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it can form dense stands.</p>
