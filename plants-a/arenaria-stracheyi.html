<p>Arenaria stracheyi, commonly known as the Strachey's sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria stracheyi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its alpine and tundra habitats.</p>
