                    <h1>Asclepias odoratissima</h1>
<p>Asclepias odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, orange-to-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Asclepias odoratissima plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
