<p>Arpophyllum giganteum subsp.</p>
<p>alpinum, commonly known as the alpine carpenter's broom, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited vegetation.</p>
