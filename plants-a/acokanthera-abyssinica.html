                <h1>Acokanthera abyssinica</h1>
<p>Acokanthera abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian arrow poison, is a toxic plant native to Ethiopia and parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody shrub structure with smooth, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It contains potent cardiac glycosides, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a poison for hunting.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, handling the plant requires caution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera abyssinica has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and typically measuring 5â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, rounded crown. The flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white to pale yellow petals, and they bloom from February to April, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera abyssinica is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats and woodlands. This plant thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate. It is often associated with savannas and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with well-drained soils and limited rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera abyssinica was mainly introduced to regions of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and parts of Sudan where it is used traditionally for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in dry, rocky habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level. The plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine for treating ailments such as malaria and fever. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential ecological impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its limited distribution, it remains an important species in local ethnobotanical practices.</p>
