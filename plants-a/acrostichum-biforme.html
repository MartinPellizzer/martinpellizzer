                <h1>Acrostichum biforme</h1>
<p>Acrostichum biforme, commonly known as the double-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that split into two distinct parts, giving it its common name. The plant features long, narrow leaves with a feathery appearance, typical of many fern species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acrostichum biforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum biforme has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a lanceolate shape and a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum biforme is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant moisture. This plant is commonly found in coastal swamps, mangrove forests, and disturbed wetlands. It plays an important ecological role in these environments by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species.</p>
<p>Acrostichum biforme is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum biforme was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetlands, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant is commonly found in coastal regions and along riverbanks where it can establish quickly. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites in several parts of the world.</p>
