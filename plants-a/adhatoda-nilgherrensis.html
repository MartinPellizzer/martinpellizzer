<p>Adhatoda nilgherrensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri adenocalymma, is a perennial shrub native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda nilgherrensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, measuring approximately 5–10 cm in length and 2–4 cm in width, and displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical flakes. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the monsoon season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda nilgherrensis is a rare plant native to the Western Ghats of India, specifically found in the southern regions of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of South Asia, including Sri Lanka and parts of Bangladesh. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda nilgherrensis is a tropical plant known for its ornamental leaves and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
