                <h1>Acalypha × cristata</h1>
<p>Acalypha × cristata, commonly known as the crested spurge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled, and often brightly colored leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Acalypha × cristata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to add visual interest to gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha × cristata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a wavy margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish in color, with a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha × cristata is a hybrid shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Although originally found in these regions, it is now widely cultivated and naturalized in tropical and subtropical areas around the world. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as gardens, disturbed soils, and coastal regions. This plant typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and widespread cultivation, it is not considered a conservation concern and is not listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha × cristata is a striking ornamental plant known for its unique, tufted foliage that resembles a crown, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings, which root easily in water or a moist growing medium, and occasionally through seeds, though this method is less common. This plant thrives in a warm, sunny climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during colder months, making it ideal for tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, but it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier foliage. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur if overwatered, so proper care and monitoring are essential.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or begonias can enhance its ornamental appeal and promote a healthier garden ecosystem.</p>
