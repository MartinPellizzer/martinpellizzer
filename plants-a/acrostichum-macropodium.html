                <h1>Acrostichum macropodium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum macropodium, commonly known as the giant fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum macropodium has large, broad, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers clustered in spadices, which bloom in late summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are enclosed within the winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum macropodium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove forests and along the shores of brackish water bodies. This plant is well adapted to saline conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in parts of eastern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across the Indo-Malay region, where it is an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum macropodium was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils where it can thrive in moist conditions. The plant is known for its large, leathery fronds that can reach several meters in length, making it a striking addition to landscapes. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its invasive potential in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
