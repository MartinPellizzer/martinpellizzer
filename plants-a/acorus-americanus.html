                <h1>Acorus americanus</h1>
<p>Acorus americanus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps and are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that emerge from the water's surface. Its rhizomes are aromatic and have been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Acorus americanus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus americanus has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, typically green in color with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, light green to yellowish bark that grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spadices, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps the plant thrive in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus americanus is primarily native to Alaska, Alberta, Altay, Amur, British Columbia, Buryatiya, Connecticut, Idaho, Inner Mongolia, Iowa, Irkutsk, Kamchatka, Kansas, Khabarovsk, Krasnoyarsk, Maine, Manitoba, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mongolia, Montana, Nebraska, New Brunswick, New Hampshire, New York, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ohio, Ontario, Pennsylvania, Primorye, Prince Edward I., Qu√©bec, Saskatchewan, South Dakota, Tuva, Vermont, Washington, West Siberia, Wisconsin, Yakutiya, and Yukon.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. It is commonly found in temperate and subarctic regions across North America and parts of Asia. Acorus americanus is often associated with moist soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its presence is indicative of aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus americanus was mainly introduced to Colorado.</p>
<p>It has been found in wetland areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant is often associated with disturbed or moist soils. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of the state.</p>
<p>Its spread can impact native vegetation and alter wetland ecosystems.</p>
