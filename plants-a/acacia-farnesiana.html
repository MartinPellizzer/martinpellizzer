<p>Acacia farnesiana, commonly known as the mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive tendrils. The plant produces yellow to orange globular flower heads, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment.</p>
