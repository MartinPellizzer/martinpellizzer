                    <h1>Acer colchicum var. tricolor</h1>
<p>Acer colchicum var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-color maple, is a rare and striking variant of the red maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, which displays three distinct colors—typically red, yellow, and green—on the same leaf. This variation is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll and pigment distribution. The plant is native to specific regions in the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
