                <h1>Acrostichum cubense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cubense has large, lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cubense is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, including parts of Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and saltwater tidal zones. This plant is well adapted to saline conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in southern Florida and the Yucat√°n Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate both freshwater and brackish water habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cubense was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies where it can access abundant moisture. The plant's introduction has been associated with human activities such as land development and the alteration of natural water systems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, in its native habitat, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
