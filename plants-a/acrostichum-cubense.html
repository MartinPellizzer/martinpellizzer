<p>Acrostichum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
