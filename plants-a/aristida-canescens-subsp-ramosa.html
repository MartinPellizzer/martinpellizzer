<p>Aristida canescens subsp.</p>
<p>ramosa, commonly known as the hairy threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and hairy lemma surfaces, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in environments with low precipitation and poor soil conditions.</p>
