                <h1>Acer × coriaceum</h1>
<p>Acer × coriaceum, commonly known as the European mountain ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Acer, which includes maple trees, and is a hybrid between *Acer negundo* and *Acer pseudoplatanus*. The tree is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, with shallow furrows, and the tree is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × coriaceum has compound leaves that are palmately lobed, with a broad ovate shape, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 inches in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure that relies on wind for pollination. Its fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting well to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × coriaceum is a hybrid maple species that originates from the natural hybridization between *Acer negundo* and *Acer trifoliolatum*.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily in eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to cultivation and specific regions in its native habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates and is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × coriaceum is a hybrid maple known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowers or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>
