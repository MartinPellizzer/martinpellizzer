<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ligustica has basal, pinnately divided leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture, and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a smooth, light green bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ligustica is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other regions with similar climates, expanding its current distribution beyond its native range. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as meadows, slopes, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and cultivation efforts, Achillea ligustica is currently listed as a species of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>
