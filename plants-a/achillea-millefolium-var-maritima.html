                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. maritima</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a coastal variant of the common yarrow.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its gray-green, feathery foliage and striking blue to purple flower heads. This plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a fern-like appearance, and it produces numerous small, composite flowers.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to maritime environments and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. maritima has narrow, feather-like leaves that are finely divided, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a grayish-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, usually hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite structures with numerous tiny florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. maritima is a coastal variant of the common yarrow, native to the shores of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed along temperate coastlines around the world, including the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America and Europe. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune environments or on rocky shores, and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It typically grows at low altitudes, often near sea level, in coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as threatened, its conservation status is of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and human disturbance.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. maritima is a hardy, coastal plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, which is most effective in early spring or fall. This plant has a perennial growth cycle, thriving in full sun and producing flowers throughout the summer months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged conditions. Minimal fertilization is needed, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and provide natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. maritima is a coastal plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in coastal ecosystems, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its dense growth also offers protection and nesting sites for birds and other small animals.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
