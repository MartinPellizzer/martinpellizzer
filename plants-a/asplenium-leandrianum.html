                    <h1>Asplenium leandrianum</h1>
<p>Asplenium leandrianum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium leandrianum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
