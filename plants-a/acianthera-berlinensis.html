                <h1>Acianthera berlinensis</h1>
<p>Acianthera berlinensis, commonly known as the Berlin orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are usually pale green or white.</p>
<p>Acianthera berlinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera berlinensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with a pale greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera berlinensis is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Cusco and Arequipa. This orchid grows in high-altitude cloud forests and humid mountainous areas. It is known for its striking purple and white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is endemic to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera berlinensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the wild in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant is believed to have been introduced through horticultural trade or accidental spread from cultivated gardens. It has since become established in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to its limited distribution and low population density.</p>
