                <h1>Aechmea echinata</h1>
<p>Aechmea echinata, commonly known as the spiny pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, violet to purple flowers. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 1 meter in length.</p>
<p>Aechmea echinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea echinata has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically lanceolate, arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy blue-gray surface and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, thickened base with a fibrous, rough-textured bark. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, with small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in the soil, with some rhizomes forming underground connections.</p>
