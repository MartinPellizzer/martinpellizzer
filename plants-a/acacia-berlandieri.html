<p>Acacia berlandieri, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia berlandieri is also valued for its role in providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
