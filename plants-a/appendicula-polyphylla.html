                    <h1>Appendicula polyphylla</h1>
<p>Appendicula polyphylla, commonly known as the clustered mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a tight cluster, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
