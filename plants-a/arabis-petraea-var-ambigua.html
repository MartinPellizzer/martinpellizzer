<p>Arabis petraea var. ambigua, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in crevices and on slopes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
