<p>Alnus glutinosa subsp.</p>
<p>elliptica, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving the plant a distinctive texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the berries, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, woodland areas and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
