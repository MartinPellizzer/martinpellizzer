<p>Astragalus incanus var. pinguefactus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its thickened, fleshy leaves and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats.</p>
