                <h1>Achillea partheniifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea partheniifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and grasslands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>Achillea partheniifolia is often used in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniifolia has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to a height of about 30-60 cm. The flowers are yellow, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, blooming from June to August and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and dry meadows. This plant thrives in temperate climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Its distribution includes countries like Spain, Italy, France, and Morocco.</p>
<p>It is often associated with coastal and mountainous areas where it can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a weed in several regions of the country. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly invasive in disturbed environments such as roadsides and riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a threat to native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread through mechanical removal and herbicide application.</p>
