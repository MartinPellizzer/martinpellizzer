                    <h1>Acanthophyllum pungens var. subglabrusculum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum pungens var. subglabrusculum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
