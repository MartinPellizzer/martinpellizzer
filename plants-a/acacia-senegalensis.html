                    <h1>Acacia senegalensis</h1>
<p>Acacia senegalensis, commonly known as the gum arabic tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched trunk and bipinnate leaves that are often shed during dry seasons. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. It produces yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing a sticky, resinous substance known as gum arabic, which is commercially valuable.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
