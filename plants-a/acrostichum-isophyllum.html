                <h1>Acrostichum isophyllum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum isophyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, showy spadices that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum isophyllum has elongated, narrow leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and vary in size from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with each seed having a tuft of fine hairs for aid in flight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum isophyllum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and estuarine areas. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It is also present in some parts of the Indian Ocean, particularly in coastal regions of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, its distribution is largely restricted to these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum isophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, often near water bodies.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation, altering local ecosystems.</p>
