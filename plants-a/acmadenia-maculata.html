                <h1>Acmadenia maculata</h1>
<p>Acmadenia maculata, commonly known as the spotted acmadenia, is a small shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in regions such as Queensland and New South Wales. Its leaves are often dotted with small, raised spots, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Acmadenia maculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia maculata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, bark that is greyish-brown in color and exhibits a fissured texture. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia maculata is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the region of South Africa, specifically in the Western Cape. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats. The species is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation types.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia maculata was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in degraded habitats and as part of ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and heathland environments, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for native wildlife. This plant is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions. It has been used in revegetation programs across southern Australia.</p>
<p>Its introduction has helped in the recovery of native vegetation in areas affected by land clearing and erosion.</p>
