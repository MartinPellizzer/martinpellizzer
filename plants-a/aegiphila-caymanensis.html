                <h1>Aegiphila caymanensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila caymanensis, commonly known as Caymanese aegiphila, is a rare flowering plant native to the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila caymanensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight roughness near the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
