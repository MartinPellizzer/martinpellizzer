                    <h1>Aphanochilus fruticosus var. tomentellus</h1>
<p>Aphanochilus fruticosus var. tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly coralroot, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, pale green or brownish flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
