<p>Arthropodium paniculatum var. minus, commonly known as the small-flowered spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in heathland and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in a loose panicle. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their modest size and color, but they are pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
