<p>Atriplex sagittiformis, commonly known as the arrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arrow-shaped, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Atriplex sagittiformis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
