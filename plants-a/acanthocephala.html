                    <h1>Acanthocephala</h1>
<p>Acanthocephala, commonly known as the spiny-headed worms, are parasitic organisms belonging to the phylum Acanthocephala.</p>
<p>These animals are characterized by their complex life cycles, typically involving intermediate hosts such as crustaceans and definitive hosts like fish or mammals. They possess a unique anatomy, including a proboscis armed with hooks used to attach to the intestinal walls of their hosts. Acanthocephalans lack a digestive system and absorb nutrients directly through their body walls.</p>
<p>Their presence in aquatic ecosystems can have significant ecological impacts, influencing host behavior and population dynamics.</p>
