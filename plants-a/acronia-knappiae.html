<p>Acronia knappiae, commonly known as the Knapp's acronia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronia knappiae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
