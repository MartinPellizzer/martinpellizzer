                    <h1>Aira cespitosa var. juncea</h1>
<p>Aira cespitosa var. juncea, commonly known as slender false oat, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a smooth texture, while its roots form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
