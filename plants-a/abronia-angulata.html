                        <h1>Abronia angulata</h1>
<p>Abronia angulata, commonly known as the angular bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive angular shape, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Abronia angulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia angulata is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant thrives in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates. It is often associated with dunes and other coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia angulata was mainly introduced to the coastal dunes and sandy soils of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its distribution and protect local ecosystems.</p>
