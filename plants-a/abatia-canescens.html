<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with alternate leaves and often showy flowers. Its family is Salicaceae, commonly known as the willow family, which includes trees and shrubs with alternate leaves and often catkin-like flowers. Its genus is Abatia, a small genus of flowering plants native to South America, typically characterized by their woody stems and simple leaves.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abatia canescens is primarily native to Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments. It is often associated with rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these South American nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abatia canescens was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and wetlands. This plant thrives in wet to moderately wet soils and is often associated with riparian zones. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
