                    <h1>Ambelania occidentalis</h1>
<p>Ambelania occidentalis, commonly known as the western ambelania, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to its harsh environment through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong, sweet scent.</p>
<p>Ambelania occidentalis is considered endangered due to habitat loss and climate change impacts.</p>
