                    <h1>Acacia kingiana</h1>
<p>Acacia kingiana, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Acacia kingiana is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage and seasonal flowering.</p>
