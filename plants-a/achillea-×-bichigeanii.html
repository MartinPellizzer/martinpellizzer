                <h1>Achillea × bichigeanii</h1>
<p>Achillea × bichigeanii, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (chicory yarrow). The plant is characterized by its feathery, finely divided leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and wildflower landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × bichigeanii has compound, feather-like leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are yellow, composite in structure, and consist of ray florets surrounded by disc florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × bichigeanii is a hybrid plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also cultivated in various parts of the world, including the United States and Australia, due to its ornamental value. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of low conservation concern, as it is not endangered and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × bichigeanii is a hybrid perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in spring or by seed sown in early autumn. This plant has a hardy growth cycle, thriving in USDA zones 5–9 and blooming from late spring to early fall.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with deep watering during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune faded flowers to encourage reblooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>
