<p>Apium ammi var. filamentosum, commonly known as the filaments umbellifer, is a variant of the cow parsley plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, white umbels of flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides, often forming dense colonies. It has a mild, anise-like scent and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
