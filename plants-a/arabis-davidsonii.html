<p>Arabis davidsonii, commonly known as Davidson's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
