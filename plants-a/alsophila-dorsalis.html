                    <h1>Alsophila dorsalis</h1>
<p>Alsophila dorsalis, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal.</p>
<p>Alsophila dorsalis plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
