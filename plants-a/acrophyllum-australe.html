                <h1>Acrophyllum australe</h1>
<p>Acrophyllum australe, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically red or pink in color. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Acrophyllum australe is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophyllum australe has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's climbing habit and supporting its growth in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophyllum australe is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy areas within these regions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dune environments. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophyllum australe was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by early European settlers for its ornamental value. The plant thrives in coastal areas and has become naturalized in several regions. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shorelines.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread.</p>
