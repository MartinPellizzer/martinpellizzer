                <h1>Acranthera involucrata</h1>
<p>Acranthera involucrata, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stem and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact growth form. Acranthera involucrata is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera involucrata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera involucrata is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Southeast Asian region. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the understorey of the forest. It is known for its small, delicate flowers and is often associated with specific habitat conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera involucrata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape province, particularly in fynbos vegetation types. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it adaptable to various habitats. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a potential weed in some environments.</p>
