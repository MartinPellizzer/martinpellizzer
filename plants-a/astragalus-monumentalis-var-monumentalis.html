                    <h1>Astragalus monumentalis var. monumentalis</h1>
<p>Astragalus monumentalis var. monumentalis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
