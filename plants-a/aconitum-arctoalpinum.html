                <h1>Aconitum arctoalpinum</h1>
<p>Aconitum arctoalpinum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spires of showy flowers. The plant has large, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Aconitum arctoalpinum is noted for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum arctoalpinum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath, arranged alternately along the stem, with each leaf reaching up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat woody base. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in its alpine habitat.</p>
