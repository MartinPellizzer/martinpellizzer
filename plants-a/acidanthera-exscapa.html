                <h1>Acidanthera exscapa</h1>
<p>Acidanthera exscapa, commonly known as the grass of Parnassus, is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble a crown. The plant belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its delicate and ethereal appearance. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>Acidanthera exscapa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera exscapa has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slender, herbaceous texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is mostly erect. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with three petals and three sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera exscapa is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Cape Province and extends into parts of Namibia and Botswana. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes open grasslands and fynbos vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera exscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
