                <h1>Adiantum politum</h1>
<p>Adiantum politum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive, ethereal appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bright green with a silvery sheen, especially on the underside.</p>
<p>Adiantum politum thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum politum has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are linear and pinnately arranged, with a delicate, glossy green color and a slender, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a pale greenish-brown color and a creeping or trailing growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures, typically appearing in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The plant does not produce true flowers or fruits; instead, it reproduces via spores released from the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it anchor to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum politum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments, particularly in the Appalachian region. This fern thrives in rocky or wooded areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often seen along stream banks, in ravines, and in the understory of deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from New England down through the eastern United States to the southern Appalachian Mountains.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum politum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly found in regions where there is consistent moisture and partial to full shade. Its introduction has been noted in various parts of the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and eastern states.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
