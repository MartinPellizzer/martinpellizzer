                <h1>Aegiphila venezuelensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan shrub, is a small, evergreen plant native to the Andean regions of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila venezuelensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brownish-gray in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
