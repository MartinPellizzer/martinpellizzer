                <h1>Acetosella decaphylla</h1>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla, commonly known as the ten-leaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla has small, round, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly woolly texture, arranged in a compact cluster at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows from the base upward. The flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is a low-growing, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries such as France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>While its native range is well-defined, its current distribution has expanded due to human activity, with populations now found in parts of North America and New Zealand. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often in areas with acidic soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 2,000 meters, where it benefits from cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread occurrence, Acetosella decaphylla is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is a low-growing, flowering plant known for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a short growth cycle, typically blooming in early spring and going dormant during the summer heat.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be light and applied in early spring, while pruning is minimal, focusing on removing dead or damaged foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract slugs or aphids in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its growth and create a lush, natural garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is a small, flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ecological interactions. Additionally, it contributes to soil stability and can aid in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla also plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by supporting a variety of organisms within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it can be occasionally foraged for its young leaves in traditional local cuisines. In medicinal practices, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and serves as a habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is sometimes symbolized as a sign of resilience and perseverance due to its ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla has a limited number of recognized varieties, with most attention focused on its natural form rather than cultivated types.</p>
<p>While there are no widely known popular cultivars specifically bred for ornamental use, some horticulturists have experimented with selecting plants for their unique foliage characteristics. Hybrids involving Acetosella decaphylla are rare due to its low genetic diversity and limited crossability with other species. Its horticultural importance lies mainly in its potential as a ground cover plant for shaded areas, though it remains a niche species in gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not commonly cultivated in traditional gardens.</p>
