                <h1>Acetosella decaphylla</h1>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla, commonly known as the ten-leafed sorrel, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Geraniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and grassy slopes. The plant has a rosette of rounded, hairy leaves that are typically red or purple in color, which helps it to retain moisture and withstand cold temperatures. Its flowers are small, pink or white, and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla has small, rounded leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, with a dark green color and a smooth, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stoloning, with a pale green color and a somewhat hairy texture, growing close to the ground. The flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and a green calyx, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is a small, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded slightly due to human activity, though it remains most commonly found in its native range. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in nutrient-poor soils. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where the climate is cool and moist.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acetosella decaphylla is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is a low-growing, evergreen plant known for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with new growth appearing throughout the growing season and entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is recommended, along with light pruning to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with ferns and mosses in woodland gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is a small, flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance in its dense growth habit. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its presence. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acetosella decaphylla contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil fertility through its interactions with microbial communities.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla is a small flowering plant commonly found in temperate regions, known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it serves as an important food source for certain insects and small animals. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some cultures for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and soil stability, supporting ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a symbol of resilience in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acetosella decaphylla has a limited number of recognized varieties, but it is more widely cultivated for its ornamental value than for its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Compacta' and 'Variegata', which are prized for their compact growth habit and colorful foliage. While few natural hybrids have been documented, horticulturists have developed selections that enhance the plant's visual appeal. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in shaded areas and its use in rock gardens and woodland landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it remains a sought-after plant among gardeners interested in specialty flora.</p>
