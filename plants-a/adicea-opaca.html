                    <h1>Adicea opaca</h1>
<p>Adicea opaca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is classified as a federally endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
