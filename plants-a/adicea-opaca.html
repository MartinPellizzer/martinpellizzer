                <h1>Adicea opaca</h1>
<p>Adicea opaca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is classified as a federally endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea opaca has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea opaca is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of swamps where the soil remains consistently moist. This species thrives in humid environments and is often associated with coastal areas and riverine habitats. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of these wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adicea opaca is also occasionally found in nearby regions of Central America, though it is most prevalent in the southeastern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea opaca was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, small white flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread into various habitats, including disturbed areas and forest edges. The plant's ability to thrive in a wide range of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade have contributed to its successful establishment. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
