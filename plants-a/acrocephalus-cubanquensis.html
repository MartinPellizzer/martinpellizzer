                <h1>Acrocephalus cubanquensis</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus cubanquensis, commonly known as the Cuban marsh warbler, is a species of grass that thrives in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus cubanquensis has narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grass-like blade shape, a bluish-green color, and a length ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright and branching sparingly. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters, each bearing tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus cubanquensis is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions of the island, particularly in the western and central parts. This plant grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It is adapted to the humid and subtropical climate of these areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Cuba.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus cubanquensis was mainly introduced to the island of Cuba.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there by human activity, possibly through the introduction of other plants or as a result of accidental transport. The plant has since established itself in certain habitats, particularly in wetlands and along water bodies. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its presence, it is not considered a major invasive species in the region.</p>
