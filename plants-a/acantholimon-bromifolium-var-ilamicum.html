<p>Acantholimon bromifolium var. ilamicum, commonly known as the Ilamicum thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, blue to purple flowers appear in dense clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in dry, coastal areas.</p>
