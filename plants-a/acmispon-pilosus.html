                <h1>Acmispon pilosus</h1>
<p>Acmispon pilosus, commonly known as hairy needlepod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Acmispon pilosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon pilosus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a pubescent surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, typically displaying a gray-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a light green to reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is usually sprawling or ascending. The flowers are small, clustered in dense cylindrical spikes, with a yellowish-green color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon pilosus is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and California. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. It is commonly found in areas with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Acmispon pilosus is well adapted to arid conditions and is often part of the vegetation in desert scrub ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon pilosus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion on slopes and in agricultural fields. It has been introduced in various regions, including parts of the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
