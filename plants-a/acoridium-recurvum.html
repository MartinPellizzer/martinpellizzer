                <h1>Acoridium recurvum</h1>
<p>Acoridium recurvum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Acoridium recurvum is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium recurvum has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a yellowish-green color, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium recurvum is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant is also present in some areas of southern Florida, United States. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium recurvum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and urban environments. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive in its native range.</p>
