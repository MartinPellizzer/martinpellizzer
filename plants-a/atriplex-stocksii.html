                    <h1>Atriplex stocksii</h1>
<p>Atriplex stocksii, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Atriplex stocksii is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems and a potential plant for land rehabilitation.</p>
