                    <h1>Aegilops umbellulata var. tuluni</h1>
<p>Aegilops umbellulata var. tuluni, commonly known as the tuluni wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces a distinctive umbellate arrangement of spikelets.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat species.</p>
