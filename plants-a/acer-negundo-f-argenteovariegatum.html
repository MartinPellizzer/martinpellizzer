<p>Acer negundo f. argenteovariegatum, commonly known as the silver-variegated ash, is a cultivar of the green ash tree characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are broadly ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a pale green to white variegation pattern along the midrib and veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types, making it a versatile ornamental tree.</p>
<p>The variegation adds visual interest, though it may reduce the plant's cold hardiness compared to its non-variegated counterparts.</p>
