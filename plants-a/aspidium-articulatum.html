                    <h1>Aspidium articulatum</h1>
<p>Aspidium articulatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium articulatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
