<p>Aciphylla spedenii, commonly known as the Speden's frostflower, is a unique plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette growth form, with dense, woolly leaves that help insulate it against harsh weather. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and insects. Aciphylla spedenii is adapted to grow in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cold and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
