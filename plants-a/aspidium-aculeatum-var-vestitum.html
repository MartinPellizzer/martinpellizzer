                    <h1>Aspidium aculeatum var. vestitum</h1>
<p>Aspidium aculeatum var. vestitum, commonly known as the hairy woodfern, is a variant of the common woodfern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fertile fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery foliage.</p>
