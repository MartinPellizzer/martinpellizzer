                <h1>Acoridium glumaceum</h1>
<p>Acoridium glumaceum, commonly known as the spike rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that form dense clumps, and its flowering spikes are usually erect and contain small, inconspicuous flowers. Acoridium glumaceum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium glumaceum has leaves that are typically lanceolate or elliptic in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a moderate size and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and unbranched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively rigid. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium glumaceum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant typically grows in dense forests or along riverbanks where there is ample humidity and organic soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in areas with partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Acoridium glumaceum is also occasionally found in parts of the Pacific Islands and northern Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium glumaceum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, often spreading via seeds carried by wind or water. This plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its success in colonizing diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
