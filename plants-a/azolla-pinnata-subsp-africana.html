<p>Azolla pinnata subsp.</p>
<p>africana, commonly known as the African water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its small, feather-like fronds that form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater bodies and is often found in rice paddies and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to suppress aquatic weeds, it is sometimes used in phytoremediation and as a biofertilizer.</p>
