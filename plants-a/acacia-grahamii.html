<p>Acacia grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. Acacia grahamii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing food for native wildlife.</p>
