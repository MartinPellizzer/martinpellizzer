<p>Acer campestre f. ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty maple, is a variant of the field maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rust-colored undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is due to its vibrant autumn foliage and unique leaf texture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. ferrugineum was mainly introduced to Europe, particularly in the British Isles, as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive rusty-brown leaves and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and hardy nature. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has also become naturalized in some areas, leading to its presence in woodland edges and open habitats.
