                    <h1>Allium tetraploideum</h1>
<p>Allium tetraploideum, commonly known as the tetraploid garlic, is a botanical variant of the garlic genus characterized by its tetraploid genome.</p>
<p>It exhibits larger bulbs and thicker leaves compared to typical garlic species, which is a result of its polyploid nature. The plant's botanical features include a bulb composed of multiple cloves, each with a papery outer layer. It is native to regions with temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its growth cycle follows a typical bulbous plant pattern, with flowering occurring in the summer months.</p>
