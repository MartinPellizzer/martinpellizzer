                        <h1>Acalypha floribunda</h1>
<p>Acalypha floribunda, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers within the bract clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Acalypha floribunda is often used in gardens for its vibrant color and ability to attract birds and insects.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha floribunda is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or near water sources. It is also present in parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and some islands in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Acalypha floribunda is an ornamental plant that is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant foliage and flowering habits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha floribunda was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there by horticulturists and gardeners who sought to diversify local landscapes with exotic species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have made it a challenge for conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Therefore, management strategies are being developed to control its spread while minimizing ecological impact.</p>
