                <h1>Acalypha floribunda</h1>
<p>Acalypha floribunda, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acalypha floribunda thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha floribunda has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and they exhibit an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and stamen, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp, dispersing by wind once mature, and the seeds are small and flat.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha floribunda is a flowering plant native to Madagascar, where it thrives in humid tropical environments.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions outside its native range, though it is not widely naturalized. The species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks. It is found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Acalypha floribunda is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha floribunda is a tropical shrub known for its vibrant foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for rapid growth. This plant thrives in a warm climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant phase during cooler months.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, but it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage blooming are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
