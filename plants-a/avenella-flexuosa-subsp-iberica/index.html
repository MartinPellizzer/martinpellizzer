                            <h1>Avenella Flexuosa Subsp. Iberica</h1>
<p>Avenella flexuosa subsp. iberica is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family that thrives in specific coastal and rocky habitats. This subspecies is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling form and silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a subtle beauty to its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
