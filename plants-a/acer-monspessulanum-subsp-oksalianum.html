                <h1>Acer monspessulanum subsp. oksalianum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>oksalianum, commonly known as the Oksalina maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in temperate climates with ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>oksalianum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a broad base and serrated margins, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and displaying a vibrant green during the growing season, turning red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in upright clusters, with greenish-yellow petals, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>oksalianum is a rare subspecies native to the southern Urals and the Caucasus region in Russia. While its original range was limited, it is now found in a few isolated locations in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils in open woodlands and along riverbanks. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and declining populations, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>oksalianum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and compact growth. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle includes a slow development phase, with the plant reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>oksalianum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>This species acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of flora and fauna. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by facilitating nutrient cycling in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>oksalianum is a lesser-known maple species with limited culinary use, though its young leaves can be consumed in small quantities. It has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties.</p>
<p>The wood of this plant is dense and durable, making it suitable for small-scale woodworking and artisanal crafts. Culturally, it is sometimes associated with local folklore and serves as a symbol of resilience in certain regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it plays a minor role in economic activities but holds ecological significance in its native environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>oksalianum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is widely cultivated for its ornamental value. Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', known for their striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>Hybrids with other maple species, such as *Acer palmatum*, have been developed to enhance color and growth habits. These plants are highly valued in horticulture for their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes make them a favorite among gardeners and landscape designers.</p>
