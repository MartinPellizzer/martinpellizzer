                    <h1>Athyrium × pangteyi</h1>
<p>Athyrium × pangteyi, commonly known as the hybrid lady fern, is a deciduous fern that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium niponicum.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching and can reach lengths of up to 60 cm. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
