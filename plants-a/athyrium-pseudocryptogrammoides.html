                    <h1>Athyrium pseudocryptogrammoides</h1>
<p>Athyrium pseudocryptogrammoides, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, moss-like tissue, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, typically in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous flap.</p>
