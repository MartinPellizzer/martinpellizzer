                <h1>Acrostichum macrorhizum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum macrorhizum, commonly known as the broadroot fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in wetlands and along stream banks in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum macrorhizum has large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum macrorhizum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including areas such as Hawaii, Fiji, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and saltwater marshes. This plant is well adapted to saline conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding, which is characteristic of its natural habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific island ecosystems where it has evolved to survive in high-salinity environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum macrorhizum was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high groundwater levels and can tolerate periodic flooding. This plant is often established in disturbed sites such as construction zones or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
