                    <h1>Aethionema subulatum</h1>
<p>Aethionema subulatum, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, adding a bright touch to its rocky habitat. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive and hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
