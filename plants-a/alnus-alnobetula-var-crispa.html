                    <h1>Alnus alnobetula var. crispa</h1>
<p>Alnus alnobetula var. crispa, commonly known as the crisped alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
