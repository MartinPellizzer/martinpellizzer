                    <h1>Atriplex exilifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex exilifolia, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex exilifolia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
