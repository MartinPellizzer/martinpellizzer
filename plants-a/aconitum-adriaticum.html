                <h1>Aconitum adriaticum</h1>
<p>Aconitum adriaticum, commonly known as the Adriatic aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are covered in a dense layer of glandular hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum adriaticum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum adriaticum has large, doubly compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that is somewhat woody in texture. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum adriaticum is primarily native to the Adriatic region, including parts of Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. This plant is commonly found in mountainous areas such as the Dinaric Alps and surrounding regions. It prefers well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates.</p>

<p>It has been established in several countries including Italy, Austria, and Germany. This plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Its introduction is primarily due to its ornamental value and historical cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
