<p>It features small, delicate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This fern-like plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its edible young shoots, which are harvested in the spring.</p>
