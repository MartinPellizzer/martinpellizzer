<p>Azorella vaginata, commonly known as the cushion plant or Andean cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, forming compact cushions of foliage. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Azorella vaginata is adapted to extreme conditions, including high altitudes, cold temperatures, and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its native range.</p>
