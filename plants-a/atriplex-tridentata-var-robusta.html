                    <h1>Atriplex tridentata var. robusta</h1>
<p>Atriplex tridentata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is highly adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, contributing to its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
