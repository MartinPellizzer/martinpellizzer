<p>Adiantum diogoanum, commonly known as the Diogo's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Adiantum diogoanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
