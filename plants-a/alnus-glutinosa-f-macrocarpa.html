                    <h1>Alnus glutinosa f. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Alnus glutinosa f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its fruits are woody, spherical nuts that are larger than those of the typical alder, hence the subspecies name *macrocarpa*.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources.</p>
