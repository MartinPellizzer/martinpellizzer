                <h1>Aechmea callichroma</h1>
<p>Aechmea callichroma, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of dark green, spiky leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its showy yellow flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea callichroma is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea callichroma has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a typical stem, instead having a short, fibrous base with a thick, spongy, and pale green pseudobark. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by bright red bracts, with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
