<p>Athyrium fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features elegant, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent, with a distinctive dark green coloration. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Athyrium fargesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
