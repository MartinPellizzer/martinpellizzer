                    <h1>Atriplex wolfii var. wolfii</h1>
<p>Atriplex wolfii var. wolfii, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often inconspicuous compared to its robust foliage. Its roots can exude salts, which helps in detoxification and contributes to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Atriplex wolfii var. wolfii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
