                <h1>Acer stachyanthum</h1>
<p>Acer stachyanthum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5â€“9 inches long. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer stachyanthum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer stachyanthum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to these areas, though it may be found in nearby regions with similar climates. It thrives in temperate to subtropical environments, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils within mixed forests. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer stachyanthum is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer stachyanthum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle of Acer stachyanthum involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or fungal infections, and it pairs well with companion plants like conifers and flowering shrubs.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer stachyanthum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting native insect populations. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by contributing organic matter through leaf litter.</p>
