                    <h1>Angelianthus humilis</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Angelicantus humilis, commonly known as the low angel's flower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky outcrops and along dry streambeds, where it relies on sporadic rainfall for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range.</p>
