<p>Aspidium menisciinerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm long and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged or floating objects. Its rhizomes are often submerged, and the fronds float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats.</p>
