                <h1>Adesmia maulina</h1>
<p>Adesmia maulina, commonly known as the woolly burr.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae, native to South America. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Adesmia maulina is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia maulina has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, slightly hairy bark that is light brown in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia maulina is primarily native to Chile Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the central regions of Chile, particularly in the Andean foothills and coastal areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly seen in dry and semi-arid environments within its native range.</p>
<p>Adesmia maulina plays a role in the local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia maulina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions like Hawaii and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit. The introduction occurred during the 19th and early 20th centuries through horticultural trade and colonization efforts. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant introductions.</p>
