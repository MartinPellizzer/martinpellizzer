<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its clusters of showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically oval and have a leathery texture, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Achneria aurea is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria aurea has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, typically displaying a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures.
