                <h1>Achyrocline anabelae</h1>
<p>Achyrocline anabelae, commonly known as Anabel's achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its flowers are usually small and yellowish, with a distinct central disc surrounded by ray florets.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline anabelae has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline anabelae is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas with well-drained soils. It is adapted to the temperate climate of this region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline anabelae was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in dunes and disturbed coastal habitats. This plant is often spread by wind due to its lightweight seeds, which can travel long distances. It has become a common weed in restoration projects and natural areas along the coastline.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
