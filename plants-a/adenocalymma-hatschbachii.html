                <h1>Adenocalymma hatschbachii</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma hatschbachii, commonly known as the Cape York rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces edible, round fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hatschbachii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a mild aromatic scent. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hatschbachii is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans these regions. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly observed in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific areas within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hatschbachii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and low humidity. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and open woodlands. It has a short lifespan and reproduces through seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches where it can establish and persist.</p>
