                    <h1>Acaena sanguisorbae var. pallida</h1>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae var. pallida, commonly known as the pale bristly weed, is a variant of the Acaena genus native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
