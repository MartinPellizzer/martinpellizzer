                <h1>Acronema pseudotenerum</h1>
<p>Acronema pseudotenerum, commonly known as the slender acronema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant's morphology includes a slender stem with alternate leaves that are often hairy.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema pseudotenerum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight longitudinal ridging. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils by forming symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema pseudotenerum is primarily native to the East Himalaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, which spans parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at higher elevations. It is commonly associated with forests and rocky slopes in the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the East Himalayan ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema pseudotenerum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rich, organic soil and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is typically spread through wind-dispersed seeds and can establish itself in disturbed or partially shaded habitats. Its introduction has been noted in several regions where it competes with native flora.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
