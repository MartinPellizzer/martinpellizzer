<p>Acacia scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpion acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorned branches and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acacia scorpioides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
