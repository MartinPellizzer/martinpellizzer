                <h1>Adonis vesicatoria</h1>
<p>Adonis vesicatoria, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple or violet flowers and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it dangerous if ingested. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is highly poisonous and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis vesicatoria has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with a lanceolate shape, a bluish-green color, and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a prominent green calyx, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis vesicatoria is primarily native to southern Europe, the Mediterranean region, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or dry habitats, including cliffs, gravelly soils, and open woodlands. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Adonis vesicatoria is often associated with mountainous and coastal regions where it can withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis vesicatoria was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as garden cultivation and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and open areas where it can establish itself easily. The plant has a wide geographic range, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental beauty and medicinal properties.</p>
