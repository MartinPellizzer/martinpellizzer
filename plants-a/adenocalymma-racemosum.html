                <h1>Adenocalymma racemosum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma racemosum, commonly known as the clustered rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in racemes, which are clusters of flowers along a stem. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma racemosum is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity, making it a hardy species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma racemosum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish color, growing in a sprawling or creeping pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma racemosum is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil West-Central, French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Adenocalymma racemosum is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of the Amazon and Guiana Shield areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma racemosum was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as southern Australia. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscaping. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on local ecosystems.</p>
