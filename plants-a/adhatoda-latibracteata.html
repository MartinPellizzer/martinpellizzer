<p>Adhatoda latibracteata, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to white in color, with five petals. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda latibracteata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a faint aromatic scent. Its flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, featuring five white to pale blue petals and a prominent yellow-green corolla, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
