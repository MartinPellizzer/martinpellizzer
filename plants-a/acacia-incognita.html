                    <h1>Acacia incognita</h1>
<p>Acacia incognita, commonly known as the unknown acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Acacia incognita is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem.</p>
