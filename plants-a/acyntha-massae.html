                <h1>Acyntha massae</h1>
<p>Acyntha massae, commonly known as the Massa thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a robust stem with spiny leaves and produces purple to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive lobed shape.</p>
<p>Acyntha massae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha massae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a deep green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to pale brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha massae is primarily native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife and Gran Canaria.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The species is commonly found in coastal areas and mountainous regions with well-drained soils. It is adapted to the unique climate and geology of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha massae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local biodiversity.</p>
