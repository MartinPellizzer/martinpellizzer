                    <h1>Atriplex halimus var. hastulata</h1>
<p>Atriplex halimus var. hastulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and drylands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is valued for ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
