                <h1>Acrocomia subinermis</h1>
<p>Acrocomia subinermis, commonly known as the African palm or the yellow palm, is a flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, spiky fruits. Acrocomia subinermis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional practices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia subinermis has palm-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with elongated, narrow leaflets arranged along a central axis, typically ranging from 1 to 3 meters in length and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is unbranched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows straight upward, forming a single trunk. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, spiny capsule that contains three seeds, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia subinermis is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry to moist lowland forests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia subinermis was mainly introduced to the Americas, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Cuba, and Mexico, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and potential use in agroforestry systems. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to grow optimally. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to various parts of the world for landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited compared to other palm species.</p>
