<p>Aegiphila sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila sellowiana has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark, growing in a bushy pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale pink, with tubular structures and five petals, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects.
