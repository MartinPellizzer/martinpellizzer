<p>Ajuga chasmophila, commonly known as the crevice ajuga, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky crevices and shaded woodland areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, spreading stems that produce clusters of small, dark blue to purple flowers in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Ajuga chasmophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
