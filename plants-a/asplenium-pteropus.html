<p>Asplenium pteropus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and often have a leathery texture. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium pteropus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden environments.</p>
