<p>Agialid barteri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Agialid barteri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
