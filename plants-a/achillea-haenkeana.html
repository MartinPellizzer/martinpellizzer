                <h1>Achillea haenkeana</h1>
<p>Achillea haenkeana, commonly known as the New Zealand yarrow, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea haenkeana has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branching, and has a grayish-brown bark with a smooth texture. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow ray flowers, blooming in spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea haenkeana is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is currently found in isolated populations within its native range, primarily in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant thrives in temperate to cold climates, typically growing in well-drained soils at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited distribution, Achillea haenkeana is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea haenkeana is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea haenkeana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in sensitive habitats.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea haenkeana contributes to the overall health of the environment by promoting soil moisture retention and supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea haenkeana is a lesser-known species of yarrow that has limited documented uses compared to its more widely studied relatives.</p>
<p>It is primarily of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts due to its restricted geographic distribution and ecological niche. While it is not commonly used in culinary or medicinal applications, it may hold potential for future pharmacological studies. Its role in traditional practices or cultural symbolism is not well established.</p>
<p>Overall, its significance lies more in its ecological role and scientific value rather than in direct human applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea haenkeana has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Paprika' and 'Lavender Glow,' which are known for their vibrant flower colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Achillea haenkeana are often developed to enhance traits such as drought tolerance and extended blooming periods. These plants are of significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions and their attractive, long-lasting flowers.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and landscapes for their aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
