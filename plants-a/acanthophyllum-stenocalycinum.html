<p>Acanthophyllum stenocalycinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in desert environments where water is scarce.</p>
