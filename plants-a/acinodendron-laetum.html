                <h1>Acinodendron laetum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron laetum, commonly known as the golden star tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and emits a sweet fragrance, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron laetum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron laetum is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded areas within these regions. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained, fertile soils. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron laetum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands, particularly in the eastern and western parts of the country. The plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with moderate rainfall. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it is not considered a major invasive species in South Africa.</p>
