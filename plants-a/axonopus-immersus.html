<p>Axonopus immersus, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Axonopus immersus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
