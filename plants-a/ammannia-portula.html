                    <h1>Ammannia portula</h1>
<p>Ammannia portula, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has dark green, waxy leaves that are broadly ovate with a serrated margin, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential weed in ponds and reservoirs.</p>
<p>Ammannia portula plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
