                        <h1>Abutilothamnus grewiifolius</h1>
<p>Abutilothamnus grewiifolius, commonly known as the Grewiifolius thornbush, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its woody stems are covered in thorn-like projections, providing defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilothamnus grewiifolius is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions and adjacent foothills of southern and central California. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. It is often seen in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a few specific locations within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilothamnus grewiifolius was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and open fields. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance. It has a low maintenance requirement, making it popular in xeriscaping and erosion control projects.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some regions has raised concerns among ecologists and land managers.</p>
