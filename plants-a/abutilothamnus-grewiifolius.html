                    <h1>Abutilothamnus grewiifolius</h1>
<p>Abutilothamnus grewiifolius, commonly known as the Grewiifolius thornbush, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its woody stems are covered in thorn-like projections, providing defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
