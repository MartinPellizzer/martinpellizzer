                <h1>Aconitum henryi var. villosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum henryi var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy Chinese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges and a velvety texture due to the presence of fine hairs.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum henryi var. villosum has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with broad, heart-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a straight, upright manner. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spicate inflorescences consisting of numerous small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, and they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached tufts.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, forming a dense underground system that helps the plant store nutrients and survive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum henryi var. villosum is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of eastern Asia, including Nepal and northern India, where it has been introduced. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum henryi var. villosum is a striking perennial plant known for its tall spires of blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of the rhizomes, with seedlings typically taking two to three years to bloom. This plant thrives in cool climates with a dormant winter and active growth in spring and summer, producing flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers moist, well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage in early spring to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and aphids, and it benefits from companion planting with ferns or hostas to enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
