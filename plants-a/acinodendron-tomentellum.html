                <h1>Acinodendron tomentellum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tomentellum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, and has a light brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tomentellum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing near the forest floor. Its distribution is largely confined to the archipelagos of the Indo-Malay region.</p>
<p>It is not found outside this specific geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tomentellum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since established itself in certain regions of the country. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other invasive species.</p>
