                    <h1>Agropyron dasyanthum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Agropyron dasyanthum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and livestock forage.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soils and provide sustenance for wildlife and grazing animals.</p>
