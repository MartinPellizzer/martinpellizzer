<p>Acacia arabica var. adansonii, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a flat, fan-like pattern, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry climates, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine or as a source of timber.</p>
