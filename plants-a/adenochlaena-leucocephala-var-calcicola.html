<p>Adenochlaena leucocephala var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone adenochlaena, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and grayish-green foliage, which is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant produces small, white, spherical flowers that are clustered at the ends of its branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, making it a common species in limestone-rich environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
