                <h1>Adnaria parvifolia</h1>
<p>Adnaria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved adnaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated for both aesthetic and traditional uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria parvifolia has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, growing in a creeping or upright manner depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria parvifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky shores, where it thrives in saline and well-drained soils. This plant is particularly associated with the western Mediterranean, such as southern France, Spain, and Italy. It often grows in shallow tidal zones and is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>Adnaria parvifolia is also present in some regions of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria parvifolia was mainly introduced to coastal areas of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky shorelines where it can establish dense colonies. This plant is often found in intertidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited by its specific habitat requirements and environmental conditions.</p>
