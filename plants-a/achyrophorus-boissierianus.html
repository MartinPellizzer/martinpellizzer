                <h1>Achyrophorus boissierianus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus boissierianus, commonly known as the Boissier's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and milky sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Achyrophorus boissierianus is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus boissierianus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus boissierianus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, such as cliffs, slopes, and wastelands. This plant thrives in regions with mild, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It is often associated with limestone and calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where it can receive adequate sunlight and drainage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus boissierianus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with temperate climates, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed environments, which has led to its spread beyond its original range. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is needed to prevent ecological imbalances.</p>
