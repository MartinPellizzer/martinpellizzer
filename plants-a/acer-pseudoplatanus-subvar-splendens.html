                        <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. splendens</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. splendens, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a silvery down on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it is relatively short-lived compared to other maple species.</p>
