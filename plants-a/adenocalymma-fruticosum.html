                <h1>Adenocalymma fruticosum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma fruticosum, commonly known as the bushy adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the Cape Province. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma fruticosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma fruticosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading or ascending growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white or pale pink petals, and they bloom during the spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma fruticosum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky soils or along rocky outcrops. This plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often seen in shrubland or savanna habitats. It is a hardy species that thrives in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southwestern and central parts of the African continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma fruticosum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or loamy soils, typically in coastal or inland regions with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and abandoned fields. The plant is known for its creeping growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It is commonly used in erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
