                <h1>Acnistus grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Acnistus grandiflorus, commonly known as the largeflower bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green, clustered flowers that appear in late spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus grandiflorus has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with an upright, branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus grandiflorus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed habitats. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. It is also known to occur in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and southern India.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus grandiflorus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sunny conditions and can quickly spread through its rhizomes, making it invasive in some regions. The plant is native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the United States. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have led to its classification as a noxious weed in several states.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, management strategies often include mechanical removal and herbicide applications.</p>
