                        <h1>Abutilon bathiei</h1>
<p>Abutilon bathiei, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Abutilon bathiei is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bathiei is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. This plant is often associated with sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bathiei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought there in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on native flora.</p>
