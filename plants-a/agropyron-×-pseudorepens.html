                    <h1>Agropyron × pseudorepens</h1>
<p>Agropyron × pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Agropyron repens and Agropyron cristatum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with the lower spikelet being longer and more prominent. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats.</p>
<p>Agropyron × pseudorepens is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration ecology due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
