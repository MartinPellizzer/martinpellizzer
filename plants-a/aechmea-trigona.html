                <h1>Aechmea trigona</h1>
<p>Aechmea trigona, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of stiff, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The plant produces a tall flowering stem with clusters of vibrant orange-red flowers, which bloom in late summer or early fall. Its foliage is often speckled with white or silver markings, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Aechmea trigona thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea trigona has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, compact stem with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows upright. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by white bracts, and bloom in late summer to early autumn, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
