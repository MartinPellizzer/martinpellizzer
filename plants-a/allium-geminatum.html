                    <h1>Allium geminatum</h1>
<p>Allium geminatum, commonly known as the twin garlic, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous form and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic but are often used as a culinary herb rather than a primary spice. Allium geminatum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and fragrant blooms.</p>
