                <h1>Achradotypus neocaledonicus</h1>
<p>Achradotypus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and aromatic, oily wood. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achradotypus neocaledonicus has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, exhibiting a creeping growth pattern that allows it to spread along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the moist soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradotypus neocaledonicus is primarily native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the archipelago, particularly in the humid lowland areas. This plant is endemic to the region and is adapted to the specific climate and soil conditions of New Caledonia. It grows in shaded environments and is often associated with moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradotypus neocaledonicus was mainly introduced to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species found in specific habitats within the region. The plant is characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations. It plays a significant role in the local biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species from potential threats.</p>
