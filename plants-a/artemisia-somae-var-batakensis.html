<p>Artemisia somae var. batakensis, commonly known as Batak wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Artemisia species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and geographic distribution.</p>
