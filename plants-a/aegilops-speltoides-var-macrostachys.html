                    <h1>Aegilops speltoides var. macrostachys</h1>
<p>Aegilops speltoides var. macrostachys, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and spikelet-like inflorescences that bear small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces achenes as its primary seed form.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic improvement in modern wheat varieties.</p>
