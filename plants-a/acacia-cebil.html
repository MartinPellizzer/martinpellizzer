                        <h1>Acacia cebil</h1>
<p>Acacia cebil, commonly known as the Cebil tree, is a species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a broad, spreading crown. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The Cebil tree is adapted to arid and coastal environments, making it resilient to drought and salt spray.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cebil is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry and semi-arid areas of these countries, especially in the Andean foothills and surrounding steppe landscapes. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. Its distribution is also observed in parts of Peru and Ecuador, where it adapts to similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia cebil plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and food for various native fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cebil was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for reforestation and land rehabilitation projects. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is now considered an important species in ecological restoration efforts in the region.</p>
