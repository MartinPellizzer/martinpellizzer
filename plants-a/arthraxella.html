<p>Arthraxella, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Arthraxella species are often submerged and have specialized leaves adapted for underwater life.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological role make them an interesting subject in aquatic botany.</p>
