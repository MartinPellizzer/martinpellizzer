                    <h1>Agrostis nutans</h1>
<p>Agrostis nutans, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Agrostis nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its fine texture and resilience.</p>
