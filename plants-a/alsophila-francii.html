<p>Alsophila francii, commonly known as the French huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen plant with a rosette of stiff, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the leaf rosette. Alsophila francii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages and ecological succession.</p>
