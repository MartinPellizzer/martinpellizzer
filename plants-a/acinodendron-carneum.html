                <h1>Acinodendron carneum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron carneum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and can grow up to 30 meters tall. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of incense.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron carneum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron carneum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests where it is commonly found in the undergrowth. This plant is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity hotspots of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron carneum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, quarries, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. Its introduction has led to its spread along coastal and inland regions where it can establish itself rapidly.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
