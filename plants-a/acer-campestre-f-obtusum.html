                <h1>Acer campestre f. obtusum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. obtusum, commonly known as the blunt-leaf dogwood, is a variant of the common dogwood.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often more rounded than those of the typical species. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. obtusum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually rounded at the tip, arranged alternately along the stems, and measure approximately 5-8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is relatively smooth with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in open, sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. obtusum is a variant of the horse chestnut tree native to southern Europe, particularly spanning from the Iberian Peninsula through France, Italy, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>While it was historically more widespread, its current distribution is fragmented and primarily found in specific regions of southern Europe. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands, hedgerows, and along streambanks. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. obtusum is a compact, slow-growing maple known for its rounded form and striking foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in late spring or by seed, though the latter method is less common due to its slower germination. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil, requiring regular watering during dry periods.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove any dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter harmful insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. obtusum is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in woodland edges, enhancing soil stability and supporting a diverse ecosystem. The plant also aids in erosion control due to its dense root system, which helps bind soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving habitat structure and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. obtusum is a lesser-known variety of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally used in ornamental horticulture for its unique foliage.</p>
<p>While it does not have significant medicinal applications, it has been studied for its potential antioxidant properties. In industrial contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, indirectly supporting ecological and economic systems. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in regions where it is native, though its symbolic meanings are not widely documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role lies in ecological and environmental contexts rather than direct human use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. obtusum has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, such as 'Elegantum' and 'Tortuosa', which showcase striking foliage and unique growth forms.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of various hybrids, often combined with other maple species to produce plants with enhanced traits like improved hardiness or more vibrant leaf colors. These hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees in horticultural collections, offering gardeners a range of options for landscaping. The horticultural importance of Acer campestre f. obtusum lies in its adaptability to different climates and its ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids are frequently used in parks, gardens, and as specimen trees due to their aesthetic appeal and resilience.</p>
