<p>Acanthophyllum heterophyllum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum heterophyllum plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
