                <h1>Acronia stevensonii</h1>
<p>Acronia stevensonii, commonly known as the Stevenson's acronia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Acronia stevensonii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia stevensonii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia stevensonii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and in coastal dune ecosystems. This species is often associated with areas that have a high water table and are subject to periodic flooding. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from development and environmental degradation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia stevensonii was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the wild in Georgia in the 1980s. The plant was likely introduced through accidental transport via nursery stock or horticultural trade. It has since spread to adjacent states, including Florida and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and is considered a rare, non-native species in these areas.</p>
