                    <h1>Aleuritopteris × confundans</h1>
<p>Aleuritopteris × confundans, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Aleuritopteris pterodonta and Aleuritopteris jenkinsii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are typically light green to silvery in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates in aquatic or semi-aquatic settings.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive appearance and ability to thrive in water gardens.</p>
