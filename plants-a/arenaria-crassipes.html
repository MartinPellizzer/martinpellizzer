<p>Arenaria crassipes, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
