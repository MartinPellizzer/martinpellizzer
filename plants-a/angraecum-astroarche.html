                    <h1>Angraecum astroarche</h1>
<p>Angraecum astroarche, commonly known as the star-shaped angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant produces pendulous, tubular blooms that are adapted for pollination by moths, particularly the giant hawkmoth. Angraecum astroarche thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike.</p>
