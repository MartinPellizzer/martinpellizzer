                    <h1>Acacia adenanthera</h1>
<p>Acacia adenanthera, commonly known as the flame acacia, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are deciduous during dry seasons. The plant produces yellow to orange globular flowers, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods and are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
<p>Acacia adenanthera is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
