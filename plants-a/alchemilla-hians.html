                    <h1>Alchemilla hians</h1>
<p>Alchemilla hians, commonly known as the silverweed or lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Alchemilla hians thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
