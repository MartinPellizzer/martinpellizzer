                    <h1>Archidendropsis basaltica</h1>
<p>Archidendropsis basaltica, commonly known as the basalt rock cactus, is a unique succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Archidendropsis basaltica is well adapted to rocky substrates and thrives in full sun, making it a striking addition to xerophytic gardens.</p>
