                <h1>Aegiphila steinbachii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila steinbachii, commonly known as the mountain thyme, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates.</p>
<p>Aegiphila steinbachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila steinbachii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring tubular structures with purple-pink petals, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
