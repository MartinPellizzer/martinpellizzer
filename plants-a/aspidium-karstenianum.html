                    <h1>Aspidium karstenianum</h1>
<p>Aspidium karstenianum, commonly known as the Karsten's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium karstenianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
