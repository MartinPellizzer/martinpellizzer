                    <h1>Aspidium thelypteris var. incisum</h1>
<p>Aspidium thelypteris var. incisum, commonly known as the incised water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium, characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with the pinnae having a distinctive incised or toothed margin. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity.</p>
