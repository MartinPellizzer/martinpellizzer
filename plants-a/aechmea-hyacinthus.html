                <h1>Aechmea hyacinthus</h1>
<p>Aechmea hyacinthus, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. The plant produces a tall flower spike bearing colorful, showy bracts that resemble flowers, often in shades of pink, red, or orange. Its foliage is typically broad and waxy, with a bluish-green hue and prominent veins.</p>
<p>Aechmea hyacinthus thrives in humid, bright environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea hyacinthus has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, dark green surface and a blue-gray underside.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thickened base that supports the rosette of leaves. Its flowers are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette, consisting of three sepals and three petals, with a striking violet color that blooms during the summer months. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly bees.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
