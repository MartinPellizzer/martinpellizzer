                    <h1>Athyrium mcdonellii</h1>
<p>Athyrium mcdonellii, commonly known as the McDonald's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with finely serrated edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
