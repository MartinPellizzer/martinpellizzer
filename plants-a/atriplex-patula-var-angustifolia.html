                    <h1>Atriplex patula var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex patula var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found at the tips of the branches. It is a halophyte, meaning it can tolerate high levels of soil salinity, making it well-suited for saline soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
