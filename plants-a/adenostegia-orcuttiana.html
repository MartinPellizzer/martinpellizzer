                <h1>Adenostegia orcuttiana</h1>
<p>Adenostegia orcuttiana, commonly known as the Orcutt's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenostegia orcuttiana is a perennial herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia orcuttiana has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly curved, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia orcuttiana is primarily native to the central and southern regions of California, particularly in the chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This species thrives in rocky outcrops and slopes, often growing in full sun. Its distribution includes parts of Baja California and extends into the interior valleys of California.</p>
<p>Adenostegia orcuttiana is well adapted to the dry, hot conditions typical of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia orcuttiana was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that support its growth.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for certain arid or semi-arid regions. The plant is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides or abandoned fields, where it can establish quickly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its adaptability, it is not widely spread and remains a relatively rare species in most regions.</p>
