                <h1>Achyropappus ambiguus</h1>
<p>Achyropappus ambiguus, commonly known as the desert composite or sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming perennial with gray-green foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, often growing close to the ground to conserve moisture. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropappus ambiguus has small, narrow, linear leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a gray-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, hairy achene that is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropappus ambiguus is primarily native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including deserts and grasslands. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often seen along roadsides, disturbed areas, and in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends from California eastward to Texas and northward into parts of Nevada and Utah.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropappus ambiguus was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and construction sites.</p>
<p>It has become an invasive species in several regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. The plant spreads through wind-dispersed seeds, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include manual removal and herbicide application in affected areas.</p>
