<p>It is a small, mat-forming perennial with gray-green foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, often growing close to the ground to conserve moisture. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
