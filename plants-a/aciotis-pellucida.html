                <h1>Aciotis pellucida</h1>
<p>Aciotis pellucida, commonly known as the whiteleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance.</p>
<p>Aciotis pellucida is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis pellucida has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and often reddish in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis pellucida is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of South America, particularly in grasslands and open areas. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat loss, Aciotis pellucida is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aciotis pellucida is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Aciotis pellucida is typically annual, with rapid growth during the warmer months and dormancy in colder seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
