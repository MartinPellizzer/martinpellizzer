                <h1>Aciotis pellucida</h1>
<p>Aciotis pellucida, commonly known as slenderleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers.</p>
<p>Aciotis pellucida is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis pellucida has leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 8 cm in length, usually with a bluish-green or grayish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth or slightly rough texture, and a greenish or reddish-brown color, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas and yellow or orange petals, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis pellucida is primarily native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of the Caribbean. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in open grasslands or disturbed soils. It is commonly associated with dry to semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into some regions of southern North America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis pellucida was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, often colonizing roadsides and fallow fields. The plant's ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments contributes to its successful establishment in introduced ranges. It spreads primarily through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Aciotis pellucida has become a common weed in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
