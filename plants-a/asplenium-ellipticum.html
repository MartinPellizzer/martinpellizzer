<p>Asplenium ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices, woodlands, and forest floors. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the leaf blades, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium ellipticum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
