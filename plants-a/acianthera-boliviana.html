                <h1>Acianthera boliviana</h1>
<p>Acianthera boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are usually pale green to white with intricate patterns, and it produces small, round pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Acianthera boliviana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera boliviana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, and has a smooth texture, while the bark is light brown and becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and have a pale pink to white color, blooming during the spring and summer months; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera boliviana is primarily native to Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean region of the country, particularly in areas with humid cloud forests. This orchid thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. It is often associated with rocky or mossy substrates in montane forests.</p>
<p>The species is endemic to Bolivia, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera boliviana was mainly introduced to the Americas, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant is typically cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens due to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range.</p>
