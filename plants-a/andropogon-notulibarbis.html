                    <h1>Andropogon notulibarbis</h1>
<p>Andropogon notulibarbis, commonly known as the rough bladed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential indicator of hydrological conditions.</p>
