                <h1>Adenosma affinis</h1>
<p>Adenosma affinis, commonly known as the slender adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It grows as an upright shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Adenosma affinis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma affinis has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish color, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma affinis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with moist, shaded environments. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Adenosma affinis is typically found in lowland areas but can occasionally be found in higher elevations within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma affinis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in forest margins. It can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
