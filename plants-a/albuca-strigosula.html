                    <h1>Albuca strigosula</h1>
<p>Albuca strigosula, commonly known as the woolly albuca, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates.</p>
