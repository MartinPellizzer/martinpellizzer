<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, linear leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments.</p>
<p>Antennaria anaphaloides is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes.</p>
