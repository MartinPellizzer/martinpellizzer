<p>Avena verna, commonly known as false oat or spring oat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, allowing for self-pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it has a fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Avena verna is often used as a forage crop and has historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
