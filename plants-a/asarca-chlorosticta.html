<p>Asarca chlorosticta, commonly known as the green-streaked fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with a distinct chlorophyll-rich stripe running along the midrib. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that anchor it to the substrate, while the fronds are responsible for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Asarca chlorosticta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
