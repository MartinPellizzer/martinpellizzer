                <h1>Aegiphila verrucosa</h1>
<p>Aegiphila verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf aegiphila, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila verrucosa has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a bushy, upright pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its arid or semi-arid habitat.</p>
