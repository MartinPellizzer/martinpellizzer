                    <h1>Anthochloa rupestris</h1>
<p>Anthochloa rupestris, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it forms dense, compact tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its root system is adapted to retain moisture in dry environments, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Anthochloa rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh landscapes.</p>
