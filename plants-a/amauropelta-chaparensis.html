<p>Amauropelta chaparensis, commonly known as the Chapare fern, is a rare and unique member of the Pteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Amazon rainforest, specifically in regions of Bolivia and northern Peru. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, orbicular-shaped fronds that are covered in dense, velvety hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are prominently located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amauropelta chaparensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
