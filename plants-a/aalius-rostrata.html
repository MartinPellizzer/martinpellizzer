<p>Aalius rostrata, commonly known as the beak-faced orchid, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a beak. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are typically small and colorful, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aalius rostrata is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
