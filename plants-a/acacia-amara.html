<p>Acacia amara, commonly known as the bitter acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale green flowers that are clustered in globular inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, woody pods and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acacia amara is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and a capacity to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
