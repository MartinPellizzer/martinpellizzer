                    <h1>Aegilops squarrosa var. salina</h1>
<p>Aegilops squarrosa var. salina, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly tolerant of saline soils and can thrive in coastal areas where other plants struggle.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often used in restoration projects to stabilize soils in harsh environments.</p>
