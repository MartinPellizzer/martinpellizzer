<p>Asplenium × clermontiae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>rasbachiae, commonly known as the Rasbach's shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies exhibits unique morphological traits that distinguish it from its parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
