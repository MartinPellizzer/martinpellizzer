<p>Abies commutata var. glauca, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which is due to a waxy coating on the needles. The plant has a conical shape with dense, pyramidal growth, and its bark is typically light gray and fissured. It produces small, cone-like seed clusters that mature in the second year.</p>
<p>This evergreen is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
