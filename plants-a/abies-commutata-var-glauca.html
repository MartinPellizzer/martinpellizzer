                        <h1>Abies commutata var. glauca</h1>
<p>Abies commutata var. glauca, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which is due to a waxy coating on the needles. The plant has a conical shape with dense, pyramidal growth, and its bark is typically light gray and fissured. It produces small, cone-like seed clusters that mature in the second year.</p>
<p>This evergreen is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies commutata var. glauca is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>This variant of the white fir is found in areas such as western Montana, northern Idaho, and parts of Washington. It thrives in high elevation forests where cool, moist conditions prevail. The plant is commonly associated with subalpine and alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the necessary environmental conditions for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies commutata var. glauca was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevations or northern regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in coniferous forests where it forms part of the understory vegetation. This variety is known for its dense, pyramidal growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native plant species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
