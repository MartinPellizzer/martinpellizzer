                    <h1>Alsophila infesta var. fumata</h1>
<p>Alsophila infesta var. fumata, commonly known as the smoky tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, dichotomous fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically dark green with a bluish or grayish tinge, contributing to its "smoky" appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
