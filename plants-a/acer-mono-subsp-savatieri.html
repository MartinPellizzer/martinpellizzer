                <h1>Acer mono subsp. savatieri</h1>
<p>Acer mono subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri, commonly known as the Korean maple, is a deciduous tree native to Korea and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer mono subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-10 cm in length. The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer mono subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Taurus Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, growing in moist, well-drained soils within mixed forests. This subspecies typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer mono subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this tree is relatively slow, with steady growth during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant plants like ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer mono subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
