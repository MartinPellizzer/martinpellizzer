                    <h1>Aspidogyne mayoriana</h1>
<p>Aspidogyne mayoriana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and as a decorative wood. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments within dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
