                <h1>Aconitum oregonsense</h1>
<p>Aconitum oregonsense, commonly known as the Pacific woad, is a perennial herb native to western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum oregonsense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are large, deeply lobed, and typically green with a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum oregonsense is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including parts of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This plant is commonly found in areas with well-drained soil and cool, temperate climates. It is often associated with mountainous terrain and is a characteristic species of the Cascade and Coast Ranges.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum oregonsense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily spread through intentional cultivation by gardeners and horticulturists who appreciated its striking blue flowers. The plant has also been accidentally introduced through seed dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential has raised concerns among ecologists due to its ability to outcompete native species.</p>
