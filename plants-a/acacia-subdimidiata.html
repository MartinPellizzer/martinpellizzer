<p>Acacia subdimidiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and bipinnate leaves that are divided into small, needle-like segments. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Acacia subdimidiata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
