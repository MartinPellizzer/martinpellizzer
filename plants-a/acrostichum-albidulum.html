                <h1>Acrostichum albidulum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum albidulum, commonly known as the white fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones.</p>
<p>Acrostichum albidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum albidulum has large, elongated, pinnately compound leaves that are bright green on top and pale white underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and reaches heights of up to 2 meters. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum albidulum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps, where it thrives in humid and saline environments. This plant is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Mariana Islands. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in association with other mangrove species.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum albidulum was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of Florida and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. This plant is commonly used for erosion control due to its dense root system and salt tolerance. It has been introduced to several regions for its ecological benefits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
