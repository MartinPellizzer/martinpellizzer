<p>Agrimonia eupatoria subsp.</p>
<p>gigantea, commonly known as giant agrimony, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with opposite, pinnately lobed leaves that have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, elongated, woody fruits called achenes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
