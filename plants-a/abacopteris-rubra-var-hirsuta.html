                        <h1>Abacopteris rubra var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Abacopteris rubra var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy red abacopteris, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, often in shaded woodland environments. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or red in color, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abacopteris rubra var. hirsuta belongs to the plant kingdom, though specific details for phylum, class, subclass, order, family, genus, and species are not provided in the data.</p>
<p>The name suggests it is a variant of *Abacopteris rubra*, which is likely part of a larger taxonomic group. Without complete classification information, a full taxonomical hierarchy cannot be fully established. However, the varietal name indicates it is a subspecies or variant within the species *Abacopteris rubra*.</p>
<p>Further botanical research would be needed to determine its precise placement within the plant classification system.</p>
