<p>Acoridium reniforme, commonly known as the kidney-shaped water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, helping to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Acoridium reniforme is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
