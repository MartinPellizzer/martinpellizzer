<p>Arenaria tetraquetra subsp.</p>
<p>imbricata, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, succulent fruits that are sometimes consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
