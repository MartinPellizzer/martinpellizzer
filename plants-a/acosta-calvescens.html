                <h1>Acosta calvescens</h1>
<p>Acosta calvescens, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Acosta calvescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta calvescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta calvescens is primarily native to the high Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in cloud forests and grasslands, where it benefits from the humid climate and well-drained soils. It is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta calvescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several states across the southeastern United States. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, further study is needed to fully understand its impact and distribution patterns.</p>
