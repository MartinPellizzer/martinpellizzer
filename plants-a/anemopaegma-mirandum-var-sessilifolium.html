<p>Anemopaegma mirandum var. sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf anemopaegma, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant features basal leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are often covered in fine hairs. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, forming a dense mat of foliage.</p>
<p>Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
