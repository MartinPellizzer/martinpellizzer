                    <h1>Azorella utriculata</h1>
<p>Azorella utriculata, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette structure, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Azorella utriculata is well adapted to cold, arid conditions and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
