                <h1>Aegiphila obtusa</h1>
<p>Aegiphila obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters.</p>
<p>Aegiphila obtusa is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and mild aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila obtusa has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
