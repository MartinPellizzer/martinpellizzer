                <h1>Aegiphila lehmannii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila lehmannii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, hairy texture and a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, woody, and has a grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in dry, rocky soils.</p>
