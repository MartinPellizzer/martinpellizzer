<p>Achyrocline saturejoides, commonly known as the "Mexican pennyroyal," is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of tiny, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>Its essential oils are also utilized in aromatherapy and as a natural insect repellent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline saturejoides has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a rough bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and have a pinkish-white color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline saturejoides is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited to these islands, it has been introduced to other tropical regions such as southern Florida and parts of southern Brazil. It thrives in humid, coastal environments, often growing in sandy soils near the shoreline. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its restricted native range makes it vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrocline saturejoides is a compact, aromatic shrub native to South America, prized for its ornamental value and use in perfumery.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results.
