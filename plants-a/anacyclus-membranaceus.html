<p>Anacyclus membranaceus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-gray leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert environments.</p>
<p>Anacyclus membranaceus is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
