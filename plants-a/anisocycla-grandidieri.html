                    <h1>Anisocycla grandidieri</h1>
<p>Anisocycla grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. The plant has a short, thick stem with spiny leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening in the evening and closing by morning, which is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Anisocycla grandidieri is also noted for its slow growth rate and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
