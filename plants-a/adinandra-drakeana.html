                <h1>Adinandra drakeana</h1>
<p>Adinandra drakeana, commonly known as Drake's adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Adinandra drakeana is typically found in moist, shaded environments within the island's rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra drakeana has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra drakeana is a rare plant species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in specific regions of the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern rainforests. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Adinandra drakeana is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra drakeana is a unique and attractive plant known for its striking foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid environments with adequate light.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while being cautious of pests like spider mites and diseases such as root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants can enhance its growth and create a vibrant garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adinandra drakeana is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the ecosystem. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adinandra drakeana contributes to soil enrichment by improving soil structure and moisture retention.</p>
