                <h1>Adinandra drakeana</h1>
<p>Adinandra drakeana, commonly known as Drake's adenandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adinandra drakeana is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra drakeana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light grey bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra drakeana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with limestone substrates and can be found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adinandra drakeana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra drakeana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread in ecosystems where it is not naturally occurring.</p>
