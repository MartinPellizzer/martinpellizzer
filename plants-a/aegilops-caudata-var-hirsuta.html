<p>Aegilops caudata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wild oat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other wild oat species and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
