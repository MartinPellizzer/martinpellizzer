<p>Andropogon tener subvar. hirtiglumis, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in wetland habitats, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research.</p>
