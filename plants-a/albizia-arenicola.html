<p>Albizia arenicola, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deep underground. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Albizia arenicola is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
