                <h1>Acer texanum</h1>
<p>Acer texanum, commonly known as the Texas maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with three to five pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer texanum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-8 cm in length, with a serrated margin and a glossy dark green upper surface that turns reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a somewhat flaky bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a compact, upright habit. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer texanum is a small deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in Texas and adjacent areas of Louisiana and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Texas, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky hillsides, prairies, and woodland edges. Acer texanum typically grows at elevations below 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as threatened in some states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer texanum is a fast-growing, small to medium-sized maple tree native to the southern United States, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle of Acer texanum involves rapid initial growth, followed by a slower maturation phase, with optimal growth occurring in warm, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like ornamental grasses or shrubs can enhance its landscape appeal and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer texanum is a valuable native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer texanum is a species of maple native to the southeastern United States, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and cabinetry. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat various ailments, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it holds significance in local ecosystems and is often planted for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
