                <h1>Acidocroton trichophyllus</h1>
<p>Acidocroton trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy-leaved croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are not extensively studied.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton trichophyllus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton trichophyllus is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in humid lowland areas. This plant typically grows in dense forests and understorey environments. It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of Cuba.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the native habitat of the island, with no significant presence elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton trichophyllus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
