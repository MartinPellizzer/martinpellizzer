                    <h1>Astragalus elatior</h1>
<p>Astragalus elatior, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Astragalus elatior plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root system.</p>
