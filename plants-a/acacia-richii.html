                    <h1>Acacia richii</h1>
<p>Acacia richii, commonly known as the Socotra acacia, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown and feathery, thornless branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in the arid environment.</p>
<p>Acacia richii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
