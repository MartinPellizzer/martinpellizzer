                    <h1>Asplenium heteroresiliens</h1>
<p>Asplenium heteroresiliens, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller, toothed segments. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Asplenium heteroresiliens is relatively uncommon and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists studying fern diversity.</p>
