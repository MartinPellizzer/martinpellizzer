                <h1>Adenandra alternifolia</h1>
<p>Adenandra alternifolia, commonly known as the African snowball, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snow-like appearance. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for small garden spaces or container planting.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra alternifolia has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a glossy texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree.
