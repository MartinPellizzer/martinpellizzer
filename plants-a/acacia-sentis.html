                    <h1>Acacia sentis</h1>
<p>Acacia sentis, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, which are typical of the legume family to which acacia belongs.</p>
<p>Acacia sentis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates.</p>
