<p>Agrostis elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Agrostis elmeri is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
