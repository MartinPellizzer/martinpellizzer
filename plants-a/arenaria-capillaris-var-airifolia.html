<p>Arenaria capillaris var. airifolia, commonly known as the air-puff grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to disperse seeds via the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in its native habitats.</p>
