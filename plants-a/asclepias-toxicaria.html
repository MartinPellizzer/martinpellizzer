                    <h1>Asclepias toxicaria</h1>
<p>Asclepias toxicaria, commonly known as the deadly milkweed, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright orange and yellow flowers that resemble small lanterns. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, parachute-like seeds. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy coating, and the plant exudes a milky sap that contains toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Asclepias toxicaria is a member of the milkweed family and plays a role in supporting certain pollinators, though it is not as widely used as other milkweed species for monarch butterfly habitat.</p>
