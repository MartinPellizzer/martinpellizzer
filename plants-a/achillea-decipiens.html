                <h1>Achillea decipiens</h1>
<p>Achillea decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Achillea decipiens is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea decipiens has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a greenish-gray color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea decipiens is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of northern Africa and the western Mediterranean. This species thrives in dry, rocky environments and open woodlands, often growing in well-drained soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea decipiens is listed as vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea decipiens is a perennial flowering plant known for its striking yellow blooms and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its health and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea decipiens is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Achillea decipiens also plays an ecological role in supporting soil health by improving its structure and water retention capacity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
