                    <h1>Avena arenaria</h1>
<p>Avena arenaria, commonly known as the sand oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and arid environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas.</p>
<p>Avena arenaria is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
