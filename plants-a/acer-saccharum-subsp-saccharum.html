<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>saccharum, commonly known as sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and gold in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its sap, tapped in late winter, is a key ingredient in the production of maple syrup.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
