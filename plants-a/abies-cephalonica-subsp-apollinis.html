                        <h1>Abies cephalonica subsp. apollinis</h1>
<p>Abies cephalonica subsp.</p>
<p>apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of northern Greece. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are typically small and have a distinctive reddish-brown color when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in association with other endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies cephalonica subsp.</p>
<p>apollinis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Greek Peloponnese and the island of Rhodes. This subspecies is found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. The plant is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of these regions, including limited water availability and exposure to strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies cephalonica subsp.</p>
<p>apollinis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates, typically found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and unique cone structure.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to parts of Europe and North America, where it is used in landscaping and conservation efforts. The plant thrives in partial shade and requires consistent moisture to maintain its health.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other conifer species.</p>
