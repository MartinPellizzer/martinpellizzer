<p>Abies cephalonica subsp.</p>
<p>apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of northern Greece. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are typically small and have a distinctive reddish-brown color when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in association with other endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
