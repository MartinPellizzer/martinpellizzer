                    <h1>Abutilon saltense</h1>
<p>Abutilon saltense, commonly known as the saltbush abutilon, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous roots make it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control in degraded soils.</p>
<p>Abutilon saltense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging landscapes.</p>
