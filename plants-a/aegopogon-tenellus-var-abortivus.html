                    <h1>Aegopogon tenellus var. abortivus</h1>
<p>Aegopogon tenellus var. abortivus, commonly known as the abortive goat's beard, is a variant of the goat's beard plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its reduced floral structures, giving it a more compact appearance compared to the typical form of Aegopogon tenellus.</p>
<p>It is generally not cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features.</p>
