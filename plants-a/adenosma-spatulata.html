                <h1>Adenosma spatulata</h1>
<p>Adenosma spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenia plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma spatulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma spatulata has simple, ovate to spatulate-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in axillary groups, typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma spatulata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of southern China and has been recorded in some regions of India.</p>
<p>Adenosma spatulata is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma spatulata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban landscapes. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal contribute to its success in invasive habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its competitive nature.</p>
