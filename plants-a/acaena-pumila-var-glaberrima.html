                    <h1>Acaena pumila var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Acaena pumila var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth burrweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny fruits that form burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The plant typically has soft, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for being smooth, though the variety 'glaberrima' is noted for its reduced hair compared to other varieties. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
