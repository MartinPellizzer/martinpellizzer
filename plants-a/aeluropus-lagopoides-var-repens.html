                    <h1>Aeluropus lagopoides var. repens</h1>
<p>Aeluropus lagopoides var. repens, commonly known as the creeping saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
