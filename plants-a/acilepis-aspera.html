                <h1>Acilepis aspera</h1>
<p>Acilepis aspera, commonly known as the rough acilepis, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its rough, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis aspera has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color and exhibits a bushy growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis aspera is primarily native to Assam, China South-Central, East Himalaya, Hainan, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam, West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This species is found in a diverse range of regions across Southeast Asia and the Himalayan footholds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is commonly associated with mountainous areas and is part of the natural flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to varied ecological conditions within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis aspera was mainly introduced to the Greater Mekong region of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its potential use in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant. The distribution has expanded into parts of China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. It thrives in moist, tropical climates with rich soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
