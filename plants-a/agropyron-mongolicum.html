                    <h1>Agropyron mongolicum</h1>
<p>Agropyron mongolicum, commonly known as the Mongolian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including arid and semi-arid regions, due to its deep root system and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Agropyron mongolicum is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
