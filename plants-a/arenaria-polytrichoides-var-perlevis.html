<p>Arenaria polytrichoides var. perlevis, commonly known as the pearl sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found on rocky soils and in open, sunny habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>The variety perlevis is distinguished by its finely textured, silver-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in its natural habitat.</p>
