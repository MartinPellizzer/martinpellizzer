                <h1>Achras elengoides</h1>
<p>Achras elengoides, commonly known as the African star apple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed in some parts of Africa.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and potential use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras elengoides has large, palm-like leaves that are typically broad, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green color and can grow up to 1 meter in length. The stem is thick, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals attracted to the fruit's fleshy outer layer.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras elengoides is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry, arid regions of the island, particularly in the south and southwest. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in coastal areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of Madagascar, with its thick, fleshy leaves storing moisture.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its distinctive appearance, featuring a tall stem and large, waxy leaves.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras elengoides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, spiny fruit and foliage.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have led to its naturalization in some areas, sometimes becoming invasive. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are needed to control its spread in sensitive ecosystems.</p>
