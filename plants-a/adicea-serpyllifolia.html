<p>Adicea serpyllifolia, commonly known as common yarrow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. Its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, and range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, making it a common sight in open landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows in a compact, low form. The flowers are tiny, clustered in dense spikes, with pale blue or white petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia is a perennial herb native to Europe, particularly found in the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to parts of North Africa and the Middle East, though it remains primarily associated with its original range. This plant thrives in rocky, dry habitats, often growing on slopes and in disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia is a low-maintenance plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Adicea serpyllifolia is perennial, with active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be light during the growing season, and regular pruning helps maintain its compact form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract slugs or snails.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia is a low-growing plant that provides food and shelter for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, white flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain garden settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense, root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia is a small flowering plant commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, known for its medicinal properties.</p>
