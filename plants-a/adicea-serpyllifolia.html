                <h1>Adicea serpyllifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia, commonly known as common yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring a basal rosette of linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and smooth, with a pale green color, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and coastal areas. This plant is commonly found in countries like Spain, Italy, France, and Morocco. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes parts of the Middle East and the western coast of Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea serpyllifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there as a decorative plant due to its attractive, silver-green foliage. However, it has since spread aggressively, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize a wide range of habitats, including grasslands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its rapid growth and ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually.</p>
