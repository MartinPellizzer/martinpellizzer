                <h1>Acmena oblata</h1>
<p>Acmena oblata, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Acmena oblata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena oblata has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a smooth, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds by animals that eat the fleshy pulp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena oblata is primarily native to eastern and southeastern Australia, including regions such as New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, rainforests, and moist understory environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with subtropical and tropical rainforest ecosystems. It is also known to grow in shaded areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Acmena oblata is an important component of native plant communities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena oblata was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and moderate growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides in regions with a subtropical to tropical climate. The plant has been reported in several countries including Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most regions.</p>
