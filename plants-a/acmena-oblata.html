                <h1>Acmena oblata</h1>
<p>Acmena oblata, commonly known as the broadleaf acmena, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small oranges. These fruits contain a single seed enclosed in a fibrous pulp, which is often consumed by local populations.</p>
<p>Acmena oblata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and unique fruit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena oblata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena oblata is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in humid, tropical rainforests and is typically found in lowland areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. Acmena oblata is commonly found at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land-use changes, leading to concerns about its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmena oblata is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 5â€“7 years, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and promote air circulation are recommended.
