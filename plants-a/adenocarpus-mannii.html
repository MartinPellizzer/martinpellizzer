                <h1>Adenocarpus mannii</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish or greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive pod-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii is also noted for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from January to March, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii is primarily native to Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Gulf of Guinea Is., Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and savannas, often in areas with well-drained soils. Adenocarpus mannii is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to a range of environmental conditions in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate, characterized by warm temperatures and seasonal rainfall. This plant is often found in the wild in parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Its introduction to new areas is typically associated with human activities, including agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become an invasive species in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
