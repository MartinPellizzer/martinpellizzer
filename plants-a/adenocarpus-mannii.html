                <h1>Adenocarpus mannii</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by capsule-like fruits containing seeds with silky hairs. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii has leaves that are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a dark green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of East and Central Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows in forests, undergrowth, and along stream banks, preferring humid and warm climates. Adenocarpus mannii is usually found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii is a flowering plant native to Africa, known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Adenocarpus mannii includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, while diseases like root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus mannii is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in the ecosystem. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil fertility through its root systems.</p>
