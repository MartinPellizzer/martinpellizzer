                    <h1>Asclepias confusa</h1>
<p>Asclepias confusa, commonly known as the Florida milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns, which are characteristic of the milkweed genus. Asclepias confusa is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential food for its larvae.</p>
<p>Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to most herbivores but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
