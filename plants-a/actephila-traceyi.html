                <h1>Actephila traceyi</h1>
<p>Actephila traceyi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila traceyi has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a moderate size, usually ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white or pale pink petals, and they bloom during the spring season; the plant is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila traceyi is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the state, particularly in the wet tropical regions. This plant typically grows in rainforest and adjacent habitats. It is commonly associated with areas that have high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Queensland's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila traceyi was mainly introduced to disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate and can tolerate some level of drought. It spreads primarily through vegetative reproduction, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common invasive species in several regions where it has been introduced.</p>
