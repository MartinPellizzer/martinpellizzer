<p>Achyropsis minutissima, commonly known as the minute sandmat, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its small size and low-growing habit help it conserve water and avoid desiccation.</p>
