<p>Arenaria capillaris lusus brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has thin, wiry stems and tiny, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in alpine and coastal environments where it thrives in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
