                <h1>Acmella lanceolata</h1>
<p>Acmella lanceolata, commonly known as the spiked sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive central disk. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and often reddish in color.</p>
<p>Acmella lanceolata is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella lanceolata has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 2–5 cm long and 0.5–1 cm wide, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, yellow, and have a distinctive central white spot, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella lanceolata is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across parts of Central and South America, as well as some Caribbean islands. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acmella lanceolata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently threatened with extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella lanceolata is a flowering plant known for its vibrant orange flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most effective method for rapid growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage more blooms. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
