                <h1>Acmella lanceolata</h1>
<p>Acmella lanceolata, commonly known as the spurge pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with a distinctive lobed shape and is often found in moist, sunny habitats. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The plant contains latex, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella lanceolata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellow with a distinctive red center, arranged in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella lanceolata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Mexico, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams where it thrives in moist to semi-aquatic environments. This plant is also present in some regions of the Caribbean, particularly in coastal areas with sandy soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in areas with seasonal flooding.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella lanceolata was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores of New South Wales and Queensland. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it well-suited for coastal ecosystems. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>However, it has also been noted to spread beyond its intended areas, raising concerns about its impact on native vegetation.</p>
