                <h1>Acer kungshanense var. acuminatilobum</h1>
<p>Acer kungshanense var. acuminatilobum, commonly known as the Kungshan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are typically lobed and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, red or yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds in the autumn. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a popular ornamental species.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense var. acuminatilobum has palmately compound leaves with a lobed shape, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 10 to 20 cm in length, exhibiting a vibrant green color during the growing season and turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, upright pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense var. acuminatilobum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in moist, cool environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forested areas. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense var. acuminatilobum is a rare maple species that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant is slow, with a focus on establishing a strong root system in the early years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and consistent moisture, though it should be watered carefully to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its structure, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its ornamental value and improve soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense var. acuminatilobum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil stability. Its deep root system helps in erosion control, preventing soil degradation in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense var. acuminatilobum is a rare and unique maple species native to China, primarily valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally explored for potential medicinal properties in local herbal practices. The tree's wood, though not widely utilized industrially, contributes to the biodiversity and habitat support for various wildlife species. Culturally, it holds significance as a symbol of resilience and natural beauty in regional ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its conservation is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and preserving botanical diversity in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense var. acuminatilobum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson Cloud,' which exhibit vibrant fall color and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It is also used in hybridization with other maple species to create new varieties with enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness and extended bloom periods. These hybrids often display striking foliage and are favored in landscape design for their aesthetic appeal. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various climates and its role in expanding the genetic diversity of ornamental maples.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is increasingly sought after by horticulturists and gardeners alike.</p>
