                <h1>Acianthera spilantha</h1>
<p>Acianthera spilantha, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Acianthera spilantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera spilantha has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with a spurred petal, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera spilantha is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Paraná. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense understory of tropical rainforests. The plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and forested slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera spilantha was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental species due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, South America, and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range is limited and primarily for horticultural purposes.</p>
