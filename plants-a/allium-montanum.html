                    <h1>Allium montanum</h1>
<p>Allium montanum, commonly known as mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has a strong, pungent odor similar to garlic, due to its sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Allium montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
