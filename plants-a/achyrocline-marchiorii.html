                <h1>Achyrocline marchiorii</h1>
<p>Achyrocline marchiorii, commonly known as the Brazilian mountain sage, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline marchiorii has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline marchiorii is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. It thrives in subtropical and temperate climates, often growing in shaded forest understories. The plant is adapted to the moist, well-drained soils of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific area in South Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline marchiorii was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy habitats in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is often found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides, dunes, and sandy soils. This plant has adapted well to the warm, humid climate and is commonly seen in open, sunny environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural areas, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
