                        <h1>Acacia fauntleroyi</h1>
<p>Acacia fauntleroyi, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Acacia fauntleroyi plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
