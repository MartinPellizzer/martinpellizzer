<p>Aconitum heterophyllum, commonly known as the Indian aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Like other members of the genus Aconitum, it contains potent alkaloids that make it highly toxic.</p>
