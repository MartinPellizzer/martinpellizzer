                <h1>Aconitum perniciosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum perniciosum, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers, which are followed by egg-shaped berries. Its roots and other parts contain toxic alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum perniciosum has compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed blades that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically reaching up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rough to the touch, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in loose racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often forming a dense network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum perniciosum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including countries such as Austria, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils and open meadows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant is commonly found in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains, where it adapts well to cold climates and high altitudes. Its distribution is largely limited to these specific geographic areas due to its sensitivity to environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum perniciosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-purple flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant is toxic and poses a risk to both livestock and humans.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to significant ecological concerns in the region.</p>
