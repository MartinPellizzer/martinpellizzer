<p>Aridaria hesperantha, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aridaria hesperantha is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
