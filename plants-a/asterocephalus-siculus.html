<p>Asterocephalus siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian starhead, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny and well-drained environments. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in a dense, umbel-like pattern at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asterocephalus siculus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
