                    <h1>Athyrium zakamenense</h1>
<p>Athyrium zakamenense, commonly known as the Zakamensk fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are arranged along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Athyrium zakamenense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
