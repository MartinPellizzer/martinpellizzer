                <h1>Adenodolichos bequaertii</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos bequaertii, commonly known as the African bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant bears pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in savanna and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source and its potential for agricultural use in underutilized crop systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos bequaertii has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod containing several oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos bequaertii is primarily native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is found in the dense rainforests of central Africa, particularly in the region around the Congo River basin. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and nutrient-rich soils. It is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized plant within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos bequaertii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and degraded lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate, characterized by moderate rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, where it has been introduced as an ornamental or for soil stabilization. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas contribute to its spread in these regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
