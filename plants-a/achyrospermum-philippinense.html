                <h1>Achyrospermum philippinense</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are ovate and covered with fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum philippinense has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming from July to October, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum philippinense is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the islands of Luzon, Mindanao, and Samar. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. It is often seen in lowland and montane areas with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific habitats within the archipelago, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum philippinense was mainly introduced to the Philippines as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in lowland areas with tropical climates. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is needed to prevent its spread into sensitive habitats.</p>
