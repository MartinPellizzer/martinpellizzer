                <h1>Achyrospermum philippinense</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens.</p>
<p>It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum philippinense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring yellow petals with a purple center, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum philippinense is a flowering plant native to the Philippines, specifically found in the archipelago's tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to parts of Luzon, Samar, and Leyte, where it grows in moist, shaded areas. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils, typically found in lowland to montane forests. The plant is usually found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum philippinense is a flowering plant known for its vibrant purple flowers and compact growth habit, commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, typically blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum philippinense is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, aiding in the reproduction of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>
