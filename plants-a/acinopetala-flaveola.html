                <h1>Acinopetala flaveola</h1>
<p>Acinopetala flaveola, commonly known as the yellow-flowered acacia, is a shrub native to parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinopetala flaveola has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule containing small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinopetala flaveola is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in limestone glades and open woodlands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is known for its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinopetala flaveola was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and unique species with specific ecological preferences.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The distribution data highlights its presence in tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. Due to its limited range, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>The introduction of this plant into the dataset aims to raise awareness about its conservation status and habitat requirements.</p>
