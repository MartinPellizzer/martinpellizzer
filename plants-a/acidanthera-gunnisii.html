                <h1>Acidanthera gunnisii</h1>
<p>Acidanthera gunnisii, commonly known as the Gunns' lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, spurred shape at the base.</p>
<p>Acidanthera gunnisii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera gunnisii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a light green color and a smooth texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense umbels, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera gunnisii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Northern Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and open grasslands. It is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these provinces due to its particular habitat requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera gunnisii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically Argentina. The introduction likely occurred through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or seeds. It has since become naturalized in certain areas of New Zealand.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still under study.</p>
