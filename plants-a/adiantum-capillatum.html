<p>Adiantum capillatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble flowing hair, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum capillatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
