                    <h1>Angraecum flabellifolium</h1>
<p>Angraecum flabellifolium, commonly known as the Madagascar fan orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, fan-shaped leaves and long, slender stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is particularly notable for its night-blooming habit, which attracts specific pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
