                <h1>Acrostichum humile</h1>
<p>Acrostichum humile, commonly known as the little fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spores found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum humile has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bright green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a light brown, smooth bark that grows in a spreading pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and colonize moist, shady areas effectively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum humile is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, organic soil. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to some islands in the Caribbean as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum humile was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it common in beach dunes and tidal marshes. This plant is often found in wetland ecosystems where it forms dense stands. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
