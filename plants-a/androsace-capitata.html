                    <h1>Androsace capitata</h1>
<p>Androsace capitata, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Androsace capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
