                    <h1>Asplenium × hansii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × hansii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in moist, rocky soils or along stream banks. Its fronds are evergreen, and it does not produce spores, relying instead on vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium × hansii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to indoor growing conditions.</p>
