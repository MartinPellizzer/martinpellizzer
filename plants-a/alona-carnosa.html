                    <h1>Alona carnosa</h1>
<p>Alona carnosa, commonly known as the pink sand alga, is a unique species of algae that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and a pinkish hue due to the presence of pigments like phycoerythrin. This organism is often found in areas with high salinity and low light conditions, such as sandy shores and tidal pools. Alona carnosa plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and specialized adaptations make it an important component of intertidal ecosystems.</p>
