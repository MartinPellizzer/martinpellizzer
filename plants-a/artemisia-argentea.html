                    <h1>Artemisia argentea</h1>
<p>Artemisia argentea, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong aromatic properties. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Artemisia argentea thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
