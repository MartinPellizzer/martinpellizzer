                <h1>Acomastylis calthifolia</h1>
<p>Acomastylis calthifolia, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant grows in open, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. It has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Acomastylis calthifolia is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis calthifolia has small, alternate, ovate leaves that are generally dark green in color and measure up to 2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green to slightly reddish hue, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and a greenish center, blooming in spring and being pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis calthifolia is primarily native to southern South America, particularly in parts of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. This plant is adapted to the cool, moist climates of these mountainous areas. It often grows in rocky or gravelly soils along streambanks and in open meadows.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis calthifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is often found in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited and it does not pose a significant ecological threat.</p>
