                <h1>Acosmium mohlenbrockii</h1>
<p>Acosmium mohlenbrockii, commonly known as Mohlenbrock's acosmium, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acosmium mohlenbrockii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium mohlenbrockii has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically green and have a smooth texture, with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes woody with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium mohlenbrockii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically occurring in parts of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland wetlands. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones, where it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium mohlenbrockii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. It has become a common weed in agricultural and natural areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
