                <h1>Adenophora setulosa</h1>
<p>Adenophora setulosa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Adenophora setulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and naturalized areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora setulosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to grayish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, with a pale blue to purple color, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora setulosa is a flowering plant native to East Asia, particularly China, where it grows in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Korea and Japan, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,000 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Adenophora setulosa is listed as a vulnerable species due to its limited habitat and threats from human activity.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora setulosa is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate blue to purple flowers and silvery foliage, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring good germination rates with proper moisture. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil, requiring regular watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage compact growth and prevent self-seeding. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with neem oil or proper air circulation.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenophora setulosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Adenophora setulosa also plays a role in improving soil health by acting as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil for future plant growth.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
