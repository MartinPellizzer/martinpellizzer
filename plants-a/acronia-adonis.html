                <h1>Acronia adonis</h1>
<p>Acronia adonis, commonly known as the Adonis bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Acronia adonis has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia adonis has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are clustered in small umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia adonis is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Madeira, Portugal.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed only in specific areas of the laurel forest on Madeira, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters, often on rocky or humus-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acronia adonis is considered endangered, with conservation efforts underway to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acronia adonis is a hardy perennial plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acronia adonis is seasonal, with active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during the growing season, but overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in late winter encourages new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
