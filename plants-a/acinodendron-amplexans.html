                <h1>Acinodendron amplexans</h1>
<p>Acinodendron amplexans, commonly known as the clinging acacia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that often wrap around the stems, giving it a unique, compact appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron amplexans has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with a tubular structure and five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron amplexans is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical rainforests and is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant is often associated with humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or in the understory. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron amplexans was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban areas. This plant has shown a high capacity for adaptation, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. Its rapid growth and reproductive strategies contribute to its successful establishment in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction may pose ecological risks by outcompeting native flora in certain areas.</p>
