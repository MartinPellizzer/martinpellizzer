                    <h1>Acacia bolei</h1>
<p>Acacia bolei, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Acacia bolei is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, with deep root systems and a high tolerance for heat and low soil moisture.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood in its native habitats.</p>
