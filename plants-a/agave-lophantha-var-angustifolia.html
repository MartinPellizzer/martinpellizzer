                    <h1>Agave lophantha var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Agave lophantha var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
