<p>Ammannia robertsii, commonly known as the redroot ammannia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and bright red stems that contrast with its small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Ammannia robertsii thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vivid coloration and ability to tolerate wet conditions.</p>
