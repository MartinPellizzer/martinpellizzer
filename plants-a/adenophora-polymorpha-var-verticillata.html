                <h1>Adenophora polymorpha var. verticillata</h1>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha var. verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy inflorescences that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha var. verticillata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are generally hairy, with a bluish-green color and a serrated margin, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha var. verticillata is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and the Korean Peninsula, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often growing in well-drained soil. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as a vulnerable species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
