                    <h1>Acacia filicina f. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Acacia filicina f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that appear in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this botanical variant.</p>
