<p>Atriplex chenopodioides, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in saline areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex chenopodioides is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine and as forage for wildlife.</p>
