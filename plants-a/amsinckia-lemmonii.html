<p>Amsinckia lemmonii, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring hairy leaves that reduce water loss and deep taproots for accessing groundwater. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Amsinckia lemmonii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
