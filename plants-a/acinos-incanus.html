                <h1>Acinos incanus</h1>
<p>Acinos incanus, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, making it a common sight in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Acinos incanus is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos incanus has narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 2 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a prostrate or ascending manner. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for airborne spread.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos incanus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and chaparral areas. This plant thrives in regions with Mediterranean climates, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is also occasionally found in parts of Nevada and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Acinos incanus is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often part of the understory in coastal and interior mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos incanus was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and rocky slopes. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. It is often seen in coastal and inland regions where the climate is Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural areas, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
