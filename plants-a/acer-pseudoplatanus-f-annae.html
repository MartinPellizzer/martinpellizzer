                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. annae</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. annae, commonly known as the Annabell maple, is a rare and cultivated form of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that display a striking green color with a slight bluish tinge. The plant is typically a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often grown in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. annae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside; they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a double samara, with two winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. annae is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the Pyrenees Mountains in southern France.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to this region, it is now found in botanical gardens and collections around the world, primarily in temperate climates. This form thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers shaded to semi-shaded environments within forests. It typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and restricted natural habitat, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. annae is a unique maple cultivar known for its ornamental value and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer or through seed, though the latter is less common due to its slow germination. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is recommended, along with light pruning to maintain shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to aphids and powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can help deter pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. annae is a unique variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing ecosystem stability. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land conservation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. annae is a rare variant of the maple tree known primarily for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscaping due to its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in some regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential antioxidant properties, though its applications remain limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, though its economic significance is minimal compared to other maple species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in botanic gardens and is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in urban and rural settings.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. annae has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Crimson King' and 'Redoute,' which are known for their striking autumn color.</p>
<p>This form is also frequently used as a parent in hybridization efforts, leading to the development of various hybrids that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often combine the hardiness of Acer pseudoplatanus with the vibrant foliage of other maple species. Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, it holds significant horticultural importance in landscape design and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a sought-after choice for gardeners and landscapers alike.</p>
