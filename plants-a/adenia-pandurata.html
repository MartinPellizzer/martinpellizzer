                <h1>Adenia pandurata</h1>
<p>Adenia pandurata, commonly known as the Australian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adenia pandurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia pandurata has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and zygomorphic, with a deep violet color, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in the plant's climbing habit and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia pandurata is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical rainforests and coastal areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with riverine and swampy habitats.</p>
<p>Adenia pandurata is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia pandurata was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and nearby sandstone areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often seen in urban and suburban gardens due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential environmental weed in certain areas.</p>
