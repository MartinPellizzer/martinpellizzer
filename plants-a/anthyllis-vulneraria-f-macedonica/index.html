                            <h1>Anthyllis Vulneraria F. Macedonica</h1>
<p>Macedonian scotch broom, scientifically known as Anthyllis vulneraria f. macedonica, is a rare and distinctive plant endemic to the Balkan region. This subspecies of the common scotch broom is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and dense growth habit, making it a notable feature in its natural habitat. Found primarily in rocky and arid environments, it thrives in regions with limited soil and harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern. The Macedonian scotch broom plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
