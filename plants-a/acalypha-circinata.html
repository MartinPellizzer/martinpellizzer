                <h1>Acalypha circinata</h1>
<p>Acalypha circinata, commonly known as the curly-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally rolled leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha circinata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length and a bluish-green color when fresh, turning reddish-purple when dry.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha circinata is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now found in various parts of the world, including the United States, particularly in Florida, where it has been introduced. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, often growing along stream banks and in low-lying areas. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its invasive potential in non-native regions raises concerns for local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha circinata is a fast-growing shrub known for its vibrant, colorful foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and has a growth cycle that includes rapid vegetative growth followed by flowering in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>
