                    <h1>Atraphaxis spinosa</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis spinosa, commonly known as the spiny atraphaxis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis spinosa is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
