                <h1>Acisanthera bartlettii</h1>
<p>Acisanthera bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's acacia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acisanthera bartlettii is adapted to survive in dry, hot environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera bartlettii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera bartlettii is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils within dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed areas or along roadsides. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera bartlettii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in regions with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed agricultural fields. The plant spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-invasive species in most areas where it is found.</p>
