<p>Aspidium consanguineum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and have a wiry texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Aspidium consanguineum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
