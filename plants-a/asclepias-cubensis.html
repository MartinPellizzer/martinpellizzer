                    <h1>Asclepias cubensis</h1>
<p>Asclepias cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking, clustered flowers with five reflexed petals and a distinctive, horn-like structure called a galea. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, especially the zebra longwing, making it an important plant in ecological systems.</p>
<p>Asclepias cubensis also contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of certain butterfly species.</p>
