                <h1>Adnaria dependens</h1>
<p>Adnaria dependens, commonly known as the hanging sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in coastal waters of the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic.</p>
<p>It has a delicate, translucent body with a central column and numerous tentacles surrounding it. The plant-like structure of Adnaria dependens is actually a polyp, which captures prey using its stinging cells. It typically attaches itself to rocky substrates and can be found in shallow, tide-pool environments.</p>
<p>Its appearance resembles a flower, contributing to its common name.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria dependens has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a trailing or climbing pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in loose inflorescences, with five petals and a fragrant scent, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria dependens is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Greece, and the Levant.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and rocky shores, where it can tolerate saline and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in shallow marine environments, often growing on or near the shoreline. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas, reflecting its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Adnaria dependens is an important part of the local flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria dependens was mainly introduced to coastal areas with sandy or muddy substrates, particularly in estuarine and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with moderate to high salinity levels, such as tidal zones and mangrove ecosystems. This plant thrives in areas with shallow water and limited wave action, making it well-suited for intertidal zones. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an important part of the local flora in these regions.</p>
