<p>Adnaria dependens, commonly known as the hanging sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in coastal waters of the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic.</p>
<p>It has a delicate, translucent body with a central column and numerous tentacles surrounding it. The plant-like structure of Adnaria dependens is actually a polyp, which captures prey using its stinging cells. It typically attaches itself to rocky substrates and can be found in shallow, tide-pool environments.</p>
<p>Its appearance resembles a flower, contributing to its common name.</p>
