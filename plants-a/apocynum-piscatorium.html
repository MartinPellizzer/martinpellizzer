                    <h1>Apocynum piscatorium</h1>
<p>Apocynum piscatorium, commonly known as waterdog or swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>Apocynum piscatorium plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its preference for moist soils.</p>
