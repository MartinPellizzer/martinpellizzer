                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. coriacea, commonly known as rough lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the historical belief that it could transform base metals into gold, although this property has never been scientifically proven.</p>
