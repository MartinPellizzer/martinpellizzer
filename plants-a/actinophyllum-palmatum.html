                    <h1>Actinophyllum palmatum</h1>
<p>Actinophyllum palmatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the upper part of the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Actinophyllum palmatum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in maintaining ecosystem balance.</p>
