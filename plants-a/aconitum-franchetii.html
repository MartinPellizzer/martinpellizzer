                <h1>Aconitum franchetii</h1>
<p>Aconitum franchetii, commonly known as Franchet's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with deep lobes, and its flowers are blue to purple in color, typically arranged in racemes. Aconitum franchetii is known for containing toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both ecological and medicinal significance.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forested areas at high elevations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum franchetii has leaves that are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape, with a deep green color and a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in tall, sparsely branched clusters, and consist of five petals with a spurred lower petal; they bloom in late summer to early autumn and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum franchetii is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou provinces. This plant typically grows in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested regions and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum franchetii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. This plant has become naturalized in certain regions, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative growth. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been cultivated in gardens.</p>
