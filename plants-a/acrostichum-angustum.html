<p>Acrostichum angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and swamps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly ribbed. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to waterlogged conditions makes it a key component of freshwater wetland vegetation.</p>
