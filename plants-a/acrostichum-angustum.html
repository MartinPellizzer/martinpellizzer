                <h1>Acrostichum angustum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and swamps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly ribbed. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to waterlogged conditions makes it a key component of freshwater wetland vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angustum has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and has a smooth, light brown bark, growing in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with greenish-white petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spherical capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angustum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangroves, and moist lowland forests. This plant thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and well-drained sandy soils. It is also present in parts of southern Florida and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>Acrostichum angustum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angustum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it thrives in saline and brackish conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and estuarine environments along the southeastern coast of the United States. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system and ability to stabilize soil. It has also been introduced to other regions with similar climates for ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native species in non-native habitats.</p>
