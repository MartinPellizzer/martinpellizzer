<p>Astracantha meana, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 60 cm in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Astracantha meana is an important species for pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
