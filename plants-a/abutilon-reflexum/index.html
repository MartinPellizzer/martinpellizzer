                            <h1>Abutilon Reflexum</h1>
<p>Velvetleaf abutilon, scientifically known as Abutilon reflexum, is a unique and striking plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. Its most distinctive feature is its velvety, fuzzy leaves that give it a soft and textured appearance. This plant is often mistaken for a maple tree due to its similar leaf shape and the way it holds its foliage. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Despite its ornamental appeal, it can also act as a weed in certain areas, making it both a desirable and challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
