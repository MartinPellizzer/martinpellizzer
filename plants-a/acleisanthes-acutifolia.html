                <h1>Acleisanthes acutifolia</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>The species is known for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes acutifolia has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring pale yellow petals and a tubular shape, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes acutifolia is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the edges of deserts and grasslands. It is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific ecological zones in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes acutifolia was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought tolerance. This species has since spread into native habitats, often outcompeting native flora. It is considered invasive in some areas, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native plant communities.</p>
