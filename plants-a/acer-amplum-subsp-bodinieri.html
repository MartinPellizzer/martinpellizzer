                <h1>Acer amplum subsp. bodinieri</h1>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>bodinieri, commonly known as the Bodinier maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically have five lobes and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>bodinieri has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 10 cm in length. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with a winged seed that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>bodinieri is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, primarily found in countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Its current distribution is limited to specific high-altitude areas within these regions, where it thrives in rocky and mountainous environments. It typically grows in alpine forests and open slopes, often at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from climate change and land use, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>bodinieri is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering a more reliable method for maintaining cultivar characteristics.</p>
<p>This species has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended for optimal health. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>bodinieri is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in spring.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, especially in moist or wetland environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves overall habitat quality for local fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>bodinieri is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been historically valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industry, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports ecological systems. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain regions, though specific meanings are not well-documented.</p>
<p>Its role is primarily ecological, providing habitat and food for wildlife in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>bodinieri has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities. Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Rocket,' which are known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>Hybrids of this species are often used to enhance disease resistance and adaptability to different climates. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and suitability for urban landscaping.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in gardens and parks for their striking foliage and hardiness.</p>
