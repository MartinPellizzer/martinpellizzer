                <h1>Acourtia formosa</h1>
<p>Acourtia formosa, commonly known as the California goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Acourtia formosa is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia formosa has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in fine hairs, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia formosa is primarily native to coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores of the Pacific Ocean. This species is commonly found in areas with mild, temperate climates and moderate coastal winds. It is often associated with dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia formosa was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of southern California, where it has become established in disturbed soils and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dunes and along the edges of coastal scrub communities. The plant's introduction is believed to be due to human activity, including seed dispersal through transportation and gardening practices. It has adapted well to the local climate and has shown potential to spread into adjacent habitats.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native plant communities is still being studied.</p>
