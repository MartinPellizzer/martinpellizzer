<p>Abies pinsapo var. baborensis, commonly known as the Baborensis fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the Spanish fir, characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue needles and conical shape. The plant thrives in high-altitude, moist, and cool environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Its cones are small and reddish-brown, maturing in the second year.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
