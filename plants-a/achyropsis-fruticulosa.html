                <h1>Achyropsis fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Achyropsis fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Achyropsis fruticulosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropsis fruticulosa has small, oval-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis fruticulosa is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western and northeastern regions of the country. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is adapted to survive in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Namibia and Botswana.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis fruticulosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and arid conditions, particularly in regions where its native range has been altered by human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in habitats such as sandy soils, gravelly areas, and disturbed sites like roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh environments has contributed to its spread across various ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including parts of Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native flora and fauna remains largely understudied.</p>
