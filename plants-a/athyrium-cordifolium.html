                    <h1>Athyrium cordifolium</h1>
<p>Athyrium cordifolium, commonly known as the bird's-nest fern, is a fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped fronds that grow in a rosette formation, resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that anchors it to surfaces such as trees or rocks, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens or indoor spaces.</p>
<p>Athyrium cordifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage.</p>
