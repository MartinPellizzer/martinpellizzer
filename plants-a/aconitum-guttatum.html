                <h1>Aconitum guttatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum guttatum, commonly known as the spotted monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are surrounded by two large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum guttatum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside; they are alternate in arrangement and can reach up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and typically reddish-brown in color, with a hollow interior and a growth pattern that is herbaceous and semi-woody. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spikes, with showy petals and spurred sepals, and they bloom from late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, often forming a thick, fleshy structure that helps the plant store nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum guttatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils and open meadows at high altitudes. This species is also present in parts of northern Italy and southern France. It is commonly associated with limestone and calcareous soils, which provide the necessary conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Aconitum guttatum is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with limited vegetation cover.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum guttatum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue to purple flowers and unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states, including Oregon, Washington, and California, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Although not considered invasive in most regions, it has the potential to spread in areas with suitable moisture and soil conditions. The plant's introduction is primarily attributed to horticultural trade and intentional planting by gardeners and landscapers.</p>
<p>Monitoring its distribution is important to assess its ecological impact on native plant communities.</p>
