                <h1>Acrostichum ebeneum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum ebeneum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a lush, feathery appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ebeneum has broad, elongated leaves that are typically lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a dark green coloration on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture, and it grows in a creeping or climbing manner depending on the environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and a short blooming period during the summer months, primarily pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a three-valved capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ebeneum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamps, and along riverbanks where the soil remains consistently moist. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems or coastal areas. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ebeneum was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some areas of the Americas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
