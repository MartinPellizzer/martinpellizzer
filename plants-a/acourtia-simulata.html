<p>Acourtia simulata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, globe-shaped seed capsules. Its adaptations to dry environments include succulent leaves and a deep root system for water storage.</p>
<p>Acourtia simulata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
