                <h1>Actinodaphne rufescens</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens, commonly known as the red-leafed laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in color when mature. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with a fragrant scent, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a globose, yellowish drupe that disperses via birds after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Southeast Asian region. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, typically growing in lowland to mid-elevation areas. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and is often found near the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, forest edges, and abandoned agricultural lands. The plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is often associated with lowland evergreen forests. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
