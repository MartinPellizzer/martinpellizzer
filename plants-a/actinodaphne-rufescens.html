                <h1>Actinodaphne rufescens</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens, commonly known as the red-fruited laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are glossy and oval in shape. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically greenish-yellow, and it produces small, reddish-brown berries.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a glossy texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, pale grey bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe with a red color, dispersing primarily by birds eating the fruit and scattering the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical and subtropical regions, though it is now less common in its original range. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Actinodaphne rufescens is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens is a tropical evergreen plant known for its slow growth and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle is typically slow, with new shoots emerging in spring and growth continuing through summer and autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like ferns or hibiscus can enhance its growth in a shaded, humid environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rufescens is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its fragrant flowers and abundant nectar. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other flora in the surrounding ecosystem. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of tropical rainforests.</p>
