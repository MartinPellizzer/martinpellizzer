                    <h1>Absinthium frigidum</h1>
<p>Absinthium frigidum, commonly known as the cold absinthium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Arctic and subarctic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and short growing seasons. Its growth is typically limited to brief periods during the summer months, making it a short-lived perennial.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Absinthium frigidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
