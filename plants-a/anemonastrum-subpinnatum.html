                    <h1>Anemonastrum subpinnatum</h1>
<p>Anemonastrum subpinnatum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in a pinnate pattern, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum subpinnatum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
