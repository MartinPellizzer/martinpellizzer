                    <h1>Athyrium praetermissum var. tripinnatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium praetermissum var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the three-pinnate wood fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, triangular fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a finely feathered appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
