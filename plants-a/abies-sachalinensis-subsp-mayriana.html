<p>Abies sachalinensis subsp.</p>
<p>mayriana, commonly known as the May Island fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted.</p>
<p>The tree produces erect cones that are typically 5â€“7 cm long, containing edible seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
