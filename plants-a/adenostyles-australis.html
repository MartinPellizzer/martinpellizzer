                <h1>Adenostyles australis</h1>
<p>Adenostyles australis, commonly known as the Australian thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in a dense cluster at the end of its stem. Its flowers are often surrounded by a series of bracts that give the plant its common name.</p>
<p>Adenostyles australis is known for its resilience and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles australis has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a narrow, serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pinkish-white petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles australis is primarily native to Italy.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in areas with Mediterranean climates. This plant thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often growing on cliffs or slopes. It is well adapted to the warm, dry conditions typical of southern Italy.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to specific habitats within the Italian peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles australis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant is often spread through seed dispersal by wind and animals. It is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding in parts of California and other western U.S. states.</p>
