                <h1>Achyrocline guerreroana</h1>
<p>Achyrocline guerreroana, commonly known as the Guerrero thyme, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline guerreroana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that has a fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline guerreroana is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of the state of Guerrero. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. The plant is commonly found in shaded, moist forest understories.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline guerreroana was mainly introduced to the Pacific coastal regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadside verges and secondary forests. This plant has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal capabilities. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, possibly as a result of accidental transport or intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
