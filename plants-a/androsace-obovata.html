<p>Androsace obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to broadly ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens.</p>
