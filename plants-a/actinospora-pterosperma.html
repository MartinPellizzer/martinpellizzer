                <h1>Actinospora pterosperma</h1>
<p>Actinospora pterosperma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a hemiparasitic species. It typically grows on the trunks of trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Actinospora pterosperma is considered endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinospora pterosperma has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale yellow petals, and they bloom in spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospora pterosperma is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species is also present in parts of Papua New Guinea and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of northern Australia as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospora pterosperma was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it common in tropical and subtropical zones. The plant is typically found in the wild but has been introduced to new locations for ornamental or ecological purposes. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental spread.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
