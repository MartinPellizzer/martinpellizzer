                    <h1>Actinospora pterosperma</h1>
<p>Actinospora pterosperma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a hemiparasitic species. It typically grows on the trunks of trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Actinospora pterosperma is considered endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
