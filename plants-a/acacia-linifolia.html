                <h1>Acacia linifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia linifolia, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided and covered in small, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia linifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and as a source of natural dyes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia linifolia has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems, giving the plant a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are yellow, clustered in dense spherical heads, and bloom from late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects for pollination. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in sandy soils and coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia linifolia is a shrub native to southeastern Australia, specifically found in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions where it has been introduced, such as parts of southern California and the Mediterranean Basin. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes, heathlands, and open woodlands. Acacia linifolia typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 600 meters.</p>
<p>It is classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though it faces threats from habitat loss and land use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia linifolia is a hardy, fast-growing shrub native to Australia, commonly known as the silver wattle.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The growth cycle of Acacia linifolia is relatively quick, with mature plants reaching heights of up to 5 meters within a few years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage flowering are essential for its health.
