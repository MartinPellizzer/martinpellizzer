                <h1>Achras cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Achras cuneifolia, commonly known as the African date palm, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like species with a distinctive, palm-like appearance, featuring a thick, unbranched stem and clusters of feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red fruits resembling dates. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras cuneifolia has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 10-20 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a globose, woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras cuneifolia is primarily native to the Caribbean, including parts of Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in Central America, particularly in countries such as Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Greater Antilles and nearby islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras cuneifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its striking, palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses where it can thrive in warm, humid climates. The plant is often used as a landscape specimen because of its ability to grow in well-drained soils and full sunlight. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>
