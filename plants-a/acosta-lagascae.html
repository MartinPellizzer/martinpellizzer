                <h1>Acosta lagascae</h1>
<p>Acosta lagascae, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acosta lagascae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta lagascae has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta lagascae is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. This plant thrives in the temperate to cool climates of the Andes, typically at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat, including strong sunlight and seasonal temperature variations.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta lagascae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is often spread through human activities, including agriculture and construction, which create suitable environments for its growth. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several countries in South America.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
