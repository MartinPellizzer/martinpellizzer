                <h1>Adiantum ovalescens</h1>
<p>Adiantum ovalescens, commonly known as the oval maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures, which aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Adiantum ovalescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation indoors.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum ovalescens has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure around 15-30 cm in length, with a bright green color that turns reddish-brown when dried.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves; the plant relies on wind pollination. The fruit is not prominent, as it is a spore-producing structure, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense mats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ovalescens is primarily native to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This species thrives in humid tropical climates and is often associated with limestone substrates. Its native range is limited to specific regions within the country, where it grows in understory habitats.</p>
<p>Adiantum ovalescens plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ovalescens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and streamside habitats. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ability to thrive in partial shade. It has been reported to spread rapidly in certain environments, leading to concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its distribution remains relatively localized compared to other introduced fern species.</p>
