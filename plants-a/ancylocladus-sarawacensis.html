<p>Ancylocladus sarawacensis, commonly known as the Sarawak yew, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and unique, elongated cones that mature over several years. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in shaded, moist environments within the canopy layer of tropical forests. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is rarely used due to its scarcity and conservation status.</p>
<p>Ancylocladus sarawacensis plays a crucial role in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various endemic species.</p>
