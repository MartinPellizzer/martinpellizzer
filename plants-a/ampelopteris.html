<p>Ampelopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help them store water in arid environments. They are native to regions with dry climates, such as parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. Ampelopteris species often grow in rocky or sandy soils, and some are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as food sources in certain cultures.</p>
