                <h1>Adiantum gravesii</h1>
<p>Adiantum gravesii, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum gravesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum gravesii has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a feathery appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure around 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a delicate, translucent quality. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is slender and covered in a smooth, pale green to brownish bark.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gravesii is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in forested areas and moist environments within these regions. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions typical of mountainous and subtropical landscapes. The plant is often associated with rocky soils and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of southern China and Vietnam.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gravesii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded forest understories, often near streams or in areas with high humidity. This fern is commonly associated with disturbed sites, such as along roadsides or in areas with recent land clearing. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Adiantum gravesii is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
