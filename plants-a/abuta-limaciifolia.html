                        <h1>Abuta limaciifolia</h1>
<p>Abuta limaciifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf abuta, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive yellow-orange sap. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Abuta limaciifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abuta limaciifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant typically grows in shaded undergrowth, often near rivers or in moist forested environments. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to the western part of the Amazon basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abuta limaciifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma, where it has established itself in disturbed soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>It is often found in areas with well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. The plant has shown adaptability to a range of environmental conditions, contributing to its spread beyond its native range. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems and native plant species.</p>
<p>Continued monitoring is necessary to assess its ecological effects and manage its distribution effectively.</p>
