<p>This subspecies grows in moist, temperate climates with well-drained soils, often in mixed forests. It is commonly associated with other coniferous species and thrives in cool, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific mountainous regions in South Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies forrestii subsp.</p>
<p>longibracteata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils within mountainous areas.</p>
