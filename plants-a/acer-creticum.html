<p>Acer creticum, commonly known as the Cretan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the island of Crete in Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a striking reddish or bronze coloration during the autumn season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Acer creticum is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
