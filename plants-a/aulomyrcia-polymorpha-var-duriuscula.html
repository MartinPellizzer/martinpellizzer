                    <h1>Aulomyrcia polymorpha var. duriuscula</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia polymorpha var. duriuscula, commonly known as the thick-leaved hibiscus, is a tropical shrub characterized by its robust, woody stems and thick, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to Central and South America. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more rugged, textured foliage compared to other varieties of Aulomyrcia.</p>
