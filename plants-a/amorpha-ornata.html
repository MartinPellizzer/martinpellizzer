<p>Amorpha ornata, commonly known as the showy苞芽树, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, a common feature in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Amorpha ornata is often found in moist soils along streambanks and in woodland edges, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
