                    <h1>Agrostis pseudopungens</h1>
<p>Agrostis pseudopungens, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in wet or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
