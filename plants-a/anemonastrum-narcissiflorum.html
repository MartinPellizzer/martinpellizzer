                <h1>Anemonastrum narcissiflorum</h1>
<p>Anemonastrum narcissiflorum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that resemble those of daffodils, with showy, reflexed petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum narcissiflorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
