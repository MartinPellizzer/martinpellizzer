                    <h1>Agrostophyllum pelorioides</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum pelorioides, commonly known as the Pelorus Island lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in specific coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh, saline conditions. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rock surfaces, often found in sheltered coves and tidal zones. Its structure is relatively simple, with no distinct stems or leaves, and it reproduces through the dispersal of spores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
