                <h1>Aegilops triticoides</h1>
<p>Aegilops triticoides, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-rowed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its seeds are small and can be difficult to distinguish from those of true wheat species.</p>
<p>Aegilops triticoides has been studied for its potential role in wheat improvement due to its genetic diversity and resistance traits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops triticoides has narrow, linear leaves that are typically green in color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth texture and a light green to slightly reddish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients.</p>
