<p>Alchemilla subglobosa, commonly known as the globular lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Alchemilla subglobosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
