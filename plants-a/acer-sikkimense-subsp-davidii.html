                <h1>Acer sikkimense subsp. davidii</h1>
<p>Acer sikkimense subsp.</p>
<p>davidii, commonly known as the David's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking ornamental features, including palmate leaves with five to seven lobes that turn vibrant red in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters, preferring moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ecological role and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sikkimense subsp.</p>
<p>davidii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green sepals and no petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind after ripening in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sikkimense subsp.</p>
<p>davidii is a rare tree species native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of India. While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in eastern Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, temperate forests with well-drained soil and is typically found in mountainous regions. This species grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sikkimense subsp.</p>
<p>davidii is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique leaf shape. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species grows best in temperate climates, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing during spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may be affected by scale insects or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sikkimense subsp.</p>
<p>davidii is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil on slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of life forms in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sikkimense subsp.</p>
<p>davidii is a lesser-known maple species primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth form. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves have been traditionally used in some indigenous communities for medicinal purposes, such as treating skin conditions and inflammation.</p>
<p>In terms of industrial and economic value, it contributes to local biodiversity and may support ecological tourism in its native regions. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in the Himalayan region, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in conservation and ecological balance highlights its importance beyond direct human use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer sikkimense subsp.</p>
<p>davidii has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color. It has also been used in hybridization with other maple species to create ornamental varieties with enhanced growth habits and foliage characteristics.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and broader adaptability to different climates. Horticulturally, this species is important for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes make it a sought-after choice for horticultural collections.</p>
