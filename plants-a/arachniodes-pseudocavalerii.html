                    <h1>Arachniodes pseudocavalerii</h1>
<p>Arachniodes pseudocavalerii, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
