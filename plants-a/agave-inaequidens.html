                    <h1>Agave inaequidens</h1>
<p>Agave inaequidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of long, narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often adorned with white marginal teeth. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its adaptability to drought and poor soil makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional crafts.</p>
