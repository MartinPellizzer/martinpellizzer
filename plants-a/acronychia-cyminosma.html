                <h1>Acronychia cyminosma</h1>
<p>Acronychia cyminosma, commonly known as the lemonwood or yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia cyminosma has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, with a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange pulp, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia cyminosma is primarily native to northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical rainforests of this region. The plant typically grows in the understorey of moist, shaded habitats. It is commonly associated with areas that have fertile, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic area within Queensland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia cyminosma was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland forest areas in northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with sandy or rocky soils along the coastlines. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil conditions. It is often seen growing in association with other tropical and subtropical species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been noted in ecological studies focusing on coastal vegetation dynamics.</p>
