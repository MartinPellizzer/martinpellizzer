                <h1>Achillea nabelekii</h1>
<p>Achillea nabelekii, commonly known as the Nabelek's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea nabelekii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nabelekii has compound, serrated leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact, shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and survive in rocky or poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nabelekii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>This plant is found in rocky and grassy habitats at high altitudes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with alpine meadows. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within these mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nabelekii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of ornamental plant introductions due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
