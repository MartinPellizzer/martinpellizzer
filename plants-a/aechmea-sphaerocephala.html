                    <h1>Aechmea sphaerocephala</h1>
<p>Aechmea sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-topped bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces showy, spathaceous inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
