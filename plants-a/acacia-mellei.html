                        <h1>Acacia mellei</h1>
<p>Acacia mellei, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, and it is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia mellei is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of honey from its nectar.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mellei is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, including countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in coastal dunes and sandy soils. This plant thrives in coastal areas where it is often used as a stabilizer for dune systems. It is also present in parts of the Horn of Africa, such as Somalia and Eritrea.</p>
<p>Acacia mellei is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mellei was mainly introduced to regions with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant or for its honey-producing capabilities.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as southern Africa, parts of Australia, and the Mediterranean region. The plant thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and landscaping in arid environments. However, it can become invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in non-native habitats.</p>
