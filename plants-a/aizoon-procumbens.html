                    <h1>Aizoon procumbens</h1>
<p>Aizoon procumbens, commonly known as the creeping aizoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by pale blue or white seed pods. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Aizoon procumbens is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
