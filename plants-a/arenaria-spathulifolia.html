                    <h1>Arenaria spathulifolia</h1>
<p>Arenaria spathulifolia, commonly known as the spoonleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of spoon-shaped, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring or early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the stem tips. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in colder climates.</p>
