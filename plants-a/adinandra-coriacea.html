                <h1>Adinandra coriacea</h1>
<p>Adinandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves with a rough, textured surface. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adinandra coriacea is often found in tropical rainforests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra coriacea has leaves that are elliptical or oblong in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a pale underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, bark that is greyish-brown in color and has a fissured texture, growing as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, and are pollinated primarily by insects, blooming during the dry season. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra coriacea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This plant is typically associated with tropical rainforests and is sometimes found in secondary growth areas. It is known for its woody structure and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra coriacea was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and secondary forests. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure. It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to spread aggressively in native ecosystems.</p>
