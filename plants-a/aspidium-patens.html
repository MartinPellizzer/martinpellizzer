                    <h1>Aspidium patens</h1>
<p>Aspidium patens, commonly known as the spreading wood fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that spread outward. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance, and they often have a dark green color with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
