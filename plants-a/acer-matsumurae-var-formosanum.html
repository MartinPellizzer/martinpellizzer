                <h1>Acer matsumurae var. formosanum</h1>
<p>Acer matsumurae var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and mild climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae var. formosanum has palmately compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in upright panicles, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two distinct wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the lightweight structure of the samara.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae var. formosanum is a rare tree species native to Taiwan, specifically found in the central and southern mountainous regions of the island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within its native range, primarily in the central mountain range. It thrives in moist, temperate forests with well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded understory conditions. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae var. formosanum is a unique maple species native to Taiwan, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination and cuttings rooted in a humid environment. The growth cycle involves a slow initial phase, followed by steady growth in spring and early summer, with a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches is recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support biodiversity in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae var. formosanum is a native plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. This plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in its vicinity. Its deep roots help with erosion control, stabilizing soil in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by offering habitat and resources to a range of ecological organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae var. formosanum is a lesser-known maple species native to Taiwan, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture due to its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, it holds potential for ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability to various soil conditions. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant may be used for their potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in local art and botanical studies.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and local ecosystems highlights its importance in environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae var. formosanum has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Crimson Queen' and 'Red Baron' being among the most popular for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids between this species and other maples are rare, some horticulturists have attempted crossbreeding to enhance ornamental traits. Its unique leaf coloration and compact growth make it a valued addition to gardens and landscapes. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often used in specialized collections and for specimen planting.</p>
<p>However, its horticultural importance remains relatively niche compared to more widely cultivated maple species.</p>
