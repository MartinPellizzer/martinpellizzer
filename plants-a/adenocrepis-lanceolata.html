                <h1>Adenocrepis lanceolata</h1>
<p>Adenocrepis lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenocrepis lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis lanceolata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually gray-green in color, with a hairy surface that gives them a rough texture. The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly furrowed. The flowers are small, yellowish-green in color, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis lanceolata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe, northern Africa, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or coastal areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often associated with limestone or calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis lanceolata was mainly introduced to control weed competition in agricultural fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for use in land rehabilitation projects. Its rapid growth and dense foliage help suppress the growth of invasive weeds.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported to spread beyond managed areas, raising concerns about its potential as an invasive species.</p>
