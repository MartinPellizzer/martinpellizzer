                    <h1>Aspidium auriculatum var. subpinnatum</h1>
<p>Aspidium auriculatum var. subpinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium.</p>
<p>It is a perennial, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base on the pinnae. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
