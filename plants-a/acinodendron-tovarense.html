                <h1>Acinodendron tovarense</h1>
<p>Acinodendron tovarense, commonly known as the Madagascar starwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tovarense has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tovarense is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the rainforests of the northeastern region. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. It is typically found at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes primary and secondary lowland rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tovarense was mainly introduced to Madagascar, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities such as trade or accidental transport. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has led to ecological concerns in certain regions of the island.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its distribution to mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
