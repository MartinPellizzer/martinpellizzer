                    <h1>Androsace stolonifera</h1>
<p>Androsace stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, rocky environments. Its stolons allow it to spread horizontally, forming extensive colonies that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Androsace stolonifera is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows, scree slopes, and mountainous terrain.</p>
