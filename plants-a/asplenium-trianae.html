                    <h1>Asplenium trianae</h1>
<p>Asplenium trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. Native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Isle of Youth, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a notable species within its native habitat.</p>
