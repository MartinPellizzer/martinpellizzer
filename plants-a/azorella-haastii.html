                    <h1>Azorella haastii</h1>
<p>Azorella haastii, commonly known as the Haast's cushion plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant forms dense, low-growing cushions or mats, often covering large areas in alpine environments. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Azorella haastii is adapted to cold, dry climates and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine species.</p>
