                <h1>Acmadenia psilopetala</h1>
<p>Acmadenia psilopetala, commonly known as the slender-leaved acmadenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, narrow leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland regions. It is often found in heathlands and open forests, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia psilopetala has small, narrow, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that has a slight ridged texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia psilopetala is primarily native to western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southwest region of the state, particularly in the areas of Geraldton and the Fitzgerald River National Park. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within coastal heathlands and sandplains. It is often found in open vegetation types, including shrublands and woodland communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the southern part of the Western Australian coastline.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia psilopetala was mainly introduced to South Australia, where it has been recorded in several regions including the Lower Southeast, Mount Lofty Ranges, and the Yorke Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils within open woodlands and shrublands, often growing in association with other native species. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and has become an established part of the regional flora. It is typically found in areas with low rainfall and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has spread beyond its original introduction points and is now considered a common component of the local vegetation.</p>
