                    <h1>Asplenium propinquum</h1>
<p>Asplenium propinquum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling the feathers of a bird, hence its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium propinquum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
