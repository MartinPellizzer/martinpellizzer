<p>Aleuritopteris × godavariensis, commonly known as the Godavari water fern, is a hybrid fern species native to India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi-lobed and arching in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid conditions.</p>
