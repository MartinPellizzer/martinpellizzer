                    <h1>Arenaria caespitosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria caespitosa, commonly known as sandy pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths with small, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils makes it an important component of tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
