                    <h1>Avena tuberosa</h1>
<p>Avena tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, tuberous roots that store nutrients, making it a hardy plant adapted to dry conditions. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its tubers have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes today.</p>
