<p>Ajuga orientalis subsp.</p>
<p>aenesia, commonly known as silver carpet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that are often tinged with silver or white markings.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread vigorously and suppress weeds in woodland or rock garden environments.</p>
