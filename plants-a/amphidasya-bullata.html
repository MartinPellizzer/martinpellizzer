                    <h1>Amphidasya bullata</h1>
<p>Amphidasya bullata, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are responsible for capturing prey. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Amphidasya bullata are adapted for both aquatic life and nutrient acquisition through carnivory.</p>
