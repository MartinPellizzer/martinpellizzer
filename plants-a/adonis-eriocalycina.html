                <h1>Adonis eriocalycina</h1>
<p>Adonis eriocalycina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive, narrow calyx. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adonis eriocalycina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis eriocalycina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and hillside habitats.</p>
