                    <h1>Artemisia constricta</h1>
<p>Artemisia constricta, commonly known as green sage or white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains essential oils and compounds such as camphor and thujone, which contribute to its strong, medicinal scent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in Native American practices for ceremonial and medicinal purposes.</p>
