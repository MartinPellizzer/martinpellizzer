                <h1>Acer collinsonia</h1>
<p>Acer collinsonia, commonly known as Collinson’s maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acer collinsonia is often found in woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters of three, with greenish-yellow sepals and stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, specifically China, where it grows in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta around the world, particularly in temperate climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer collinsonia is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia is a slow-growing ornamental tree known for its striking red foliage and unique bark.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer collinsonia is typically slow, with significant growth occurring in the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with acid-loving plants like rhododendrons can enhance its growth in suitable environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local pollination networks. The tree also acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and ecological stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer collinsonia contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia is a species of maple tree native to eastern North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species, though it is less common. In traditional medicine, it has been used by Indigenous peoples for its potential health benefits, though scientific validation is limited. The tree plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in landscaping and ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia has several popular cultivars, such as 'Summerglo' and 'Crimson King', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, resulting in cultivars like 'Autumn Flame' and 'Red Sunset', which exhibit enhanced color and growth characteristics. These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in various climates and for their aesthetic appeal. The plant's adaptability makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its contribution to the diversity of ornamental maples available to gardeners worldwide.</p>
