                <h1>Acer collinsonia</h1>
<p>Acer collinsonia, commonly known as Collinson's maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are typically five to seven lobes, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Acer collinsonia is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and they grow as upright shrubs or small trees. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, though they are not particularly extensive.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia is a rare and striking maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was once thought to be extinct, it has been rediscovered in its native habitat, though its current distribution remains limited. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest understories, often growing in shaded areas with well-drained soil. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat fragmentation, Acer collinsonia is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia is a slow-growing, ornamental maple known for its striking red foliage and unique, twisted trunk.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in summer or by sowing seeds in a cold frame during late winter. The growth cycle of Acer collinsonia is relatively slow, with significant development occurring over several years, making it a long-term investment for gardeners.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent moisture, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like azaleas or rhododendrons can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer collinsonia offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a variety of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia is a decorative tree known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and unique bark.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been historically used for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing durable wood for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and beauty in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer collinsonia has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Laciniatum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage and unique leaf patterns. The species has also been hybridized with other maples, such as Acer ginnala, to produce cultivars like 'Autumnalis' and 'Laciniatum', which exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and coloration. These cultivars and hybrids are of significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping for their fall color and architectural form.</p>
