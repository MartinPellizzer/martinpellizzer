                    <h1>Avicennia intermedia</h1>
<p>Avicennia intermedia, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and estuarine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous roots, which help stabilize sediment and prevent erosion. The plant possesses pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions.</p>
<p>Avicennia intermedia plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
