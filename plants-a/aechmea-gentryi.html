                <h1>Aechmea gentryi</h1>
<p>Aechmea gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation.</p>
<p>Aechmea gentryi is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea gentryi has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, dark green surface and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, and its base is covered in a dense, fibrous, and often reddish-brown sheath that resembles bark. It produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in the soil, with some rhizomes forming a network for nutrient absorption.</p>
