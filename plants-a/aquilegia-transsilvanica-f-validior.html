<p>Aquilegia transsilvanica f. validior, commonly known as the Transylvanian poppy, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes, and it produces clusters of small, bright flowers in early to mid-summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
