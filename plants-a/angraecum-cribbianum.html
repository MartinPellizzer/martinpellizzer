                    <h1>Angraecum cribbianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum cribbianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling constellations. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, and it relies on specific pollinators, such as the hawkmoth, for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
