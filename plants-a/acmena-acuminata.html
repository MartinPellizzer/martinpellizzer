                <h1>Acmena acuminata</h1>
<p>Acmena acuminata, commonly known as the rough-leaved acmena, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds.</p>
<p>The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena acuminata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a fleshy, yellowish drupe that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena acuminata is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, including Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded beyond its native range, with plantations established in other parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland and montane rainforests. The species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its widespread cultivation and natural habitat, Acmena acuminata is currently considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmena acuminata is a fast-growing, evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and edible fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining specific cultivar traits. The tree has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity in 5â€“7 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It requires well-drained soil and regular watering, especially during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the tree and promote fruiting are essential for healthy growth, while common pests include scale insects and aphids, and diseases like root rot can be managed with proper soil drainage and care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or nitrogen-fixing plants can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>
