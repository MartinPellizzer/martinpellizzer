<p>hellenica has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a gray-green color and a slightly hairy surface. The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping manner.</p>
<p>Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia subsp.</p>
<p>hellenica is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean, primarily found in Greece and Turkey. Its current distribution includes parts of southern Europe, the Middle East, and some regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though it faces threats from habitat loss and overgrazing in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia subsp.</p>
<p>hellenica is a perennial plant known for its showy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a summer-growing cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if care is not taken.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme enhances its fragrance and repels some pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
