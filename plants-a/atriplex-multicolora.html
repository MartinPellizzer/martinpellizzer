                    <h1>Atriplex multicolora</h1>
<p>Atriplex multicolora, commonly known as the multicolored saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often coated with a salt-excreting layer, a feature that helps it survive in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex multicolora is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its vibrant foliage colors.</p>
