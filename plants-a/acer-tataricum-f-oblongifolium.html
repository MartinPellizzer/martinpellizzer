                <h1>Acer tataricum f. oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum f. oblongifolium, commonly known as the Tatarian maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive elongated, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and autumn coloration, which can range from yellow to red.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. oblongifolium has leaves that are elongated and ovate, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length and 3–5 cm in width.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. oblongifolium is a rare variant of the Tatarian maple, native to the northeastern regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, often as an ornamental plant. This plant thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks or in forested areas. It is commonly found at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and limited population, it is considered a conservation concern, with some populations facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. oblongifolium is a decorative maple known for its unique oblong leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with seedlings requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species grows best in early spring, producing new foliage and flowers throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. oblongifolium is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local pollinator populations. The plant acts as a companion plant in garden settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. oblongifolium is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal infusions.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been valued in some traditional medicine systems for its purported anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties. While not widely used in industrial applications, its wood is sometimes utilized for small crafts or ornamental purposes. Culturally, it holds significance in certain regions as a symbol of resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems, such as supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization, also contributes to its environmental importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. oblongifolium has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, such as 'Crimson King' and 'Oblongifolium', which showcase striking foliage colors and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>This species is also involved in the creation of hybrids, including crosses with other maples like Acer palmatum, resulting in plants with enhanced cold hardiness and variegation. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of climates and its contribution to landscape design with its vibrant autumn colors. The distinct foliage patterns make it a sought-after addition to gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a significant role in the maple family's ornamental horticulture.</p>
