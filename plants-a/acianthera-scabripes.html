                <h1>Acianthera scabripes</h1>
<p>Acianthera scabripes, commonly known as the rough-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>Acianthera scabripes is often found in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera scabripes has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a woody texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and clustered in inflorescences, typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera scabripes is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of SÃ£o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in humid, tropical environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. The plant is commonly found in shaded understory areas of forests and near streams.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity-rich ecosystems of this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera scabripes was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can establish itself rapidly. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
