<p>Adiantum pusillum, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that often have a shimmering appearance due to their metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum pusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant due to its graceful appearance and ease of care.</p>
