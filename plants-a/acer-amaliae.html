                        <h1>Acer amaliae</h1>
<p>Acer amaliae, commonly known as the Amalia maple, is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features palmately lobed leaves with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, which aids in the dispersal of its seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amaliae is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in California and southern Oregon.</p>
<p>It is found in the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains. This species grows in high-elevation forests and is often associated with mixed coniferous and hardwood stands. Acer amaliae is known for its distinctive yellow fall foliage and is a member of the maple family.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amaliae was mainly introduced to specific regions in the United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in gardens and parks due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The introduction of Acer amaliae has contributed to the diversity of tree species in these areas, though it is not native to the region.</p>
<p>However, its non-native status has led to discussions about its ecological impact in local ecosystems.</p>
