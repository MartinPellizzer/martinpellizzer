                    <h1>Anthoxanthum utriculatum var. altissimum</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum utriculatum var. altissimum, commonly known as the tall oatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in small, membranous sacs called utricles, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects.</p>
