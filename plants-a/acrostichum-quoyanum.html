                    <h1>Acrostichum quoyanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum quoyanum, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, robust grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, often forming dense, clumping growth. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a natural fiber source in various cultures.</p>
