                <h1>Acalypha chantrieri</h1>
<p>Acalypha chantrieri, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with deep red veins that contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha chantrieri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically glossy and dark green, sometimes with a slight reddish or purple tint on the underside. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green to brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green color, blooming during the summer months, and they are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chantrieri is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth, often near water sources. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acalypha chantrieri is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha chantrieri is a vibrant, ornamental shrub known for its colorful foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
