                    <h1>Argyroxiphium macrocephalum</h1>
<p>Argyroxiphium macrocephalum, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-green, sword-like leaves and a large, showy yellow flower head. The plant thrives in the volcanic soils of the Haleakalā National Park at high elevations, where it is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited habitat and historical overharvesting, it is listed as an endangered species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts have been implemented to protect and propagate this iconic plant.</p>
