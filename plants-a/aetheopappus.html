<p>Aetheopappus, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a single, showy head. Aetheopappus species are generally herbaceous, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provide nectar for pollinators in their native habitats.</p>
