                        <h1>Acacia tortilis var. lenticellosa</h1>
<p>Acacia tortilis var. lenticellosa, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by dense, spreading branches. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in globular heads, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>The acacia is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy coating on its phyllodes to reduce water loss.</p>
