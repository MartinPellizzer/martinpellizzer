<p>Anthemis grossheimii, commonly known as the desert chia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Anthemis grossheimii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
