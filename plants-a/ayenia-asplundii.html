<p>Ayenia asplundii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ayenia asplundii is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
