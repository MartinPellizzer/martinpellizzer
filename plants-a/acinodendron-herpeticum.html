                    <h1>Acinodendron herpeticum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron herpeticum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its roots are extensively branched and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
