                <h1>Acinodendron herpeticum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron herpeticum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its roots are extensively branched and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron herpeticum has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a pale brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron herpeticum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments where it is often found as an understory plant. This species is also occasionally reported from parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India. It prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native distribution is becoming increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron herpeticum was mainly introduced to new areas for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Its introduction is often associated with horticultural trade and intentional planting by gardeners and landscapers.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
