                    <h1>Alisma calyophyllum</h1>
<p>Alisma calyophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a semi-aquatic perennial herb native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Alisma calyophyllum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
