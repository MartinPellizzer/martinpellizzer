                    <h1>Asplenium unilaterale var. saxicola</h1>
<p>Asplenium unilaterale var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into small, toothed segments. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive line along the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to rocky substrates and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
