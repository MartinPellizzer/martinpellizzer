                    <h1>Aspidium spinulosum var. subcoriaceum</h1>
<p>Aspidium spinulosum var. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, subcoriaceous fronds that are often covered with small, spinulose projections. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are often slightly curled.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid conditions.</p>
