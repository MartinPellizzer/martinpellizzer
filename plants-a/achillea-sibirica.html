                <h1>Achillea sibirica</h1>
<p>Achillea sibirica, commonly known as Siberian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear basal leaves which are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Achillea sibirica prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, with a grayish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica is primarily native to Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Russia, and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern China and southern Siberia. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils in mountainous and steppe regions. It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into the western regions of the Russian Federation and the eastern parts of Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica was mainly introduced to the western United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, flat flower heads and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, spreading beyond cultivated areas. The plant's ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively contributes to its rapid establishment in new environments.</p>
<p>As a result, it is now considered a potential weed in certain parts of its introduced range.</p>
