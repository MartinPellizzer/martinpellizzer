                <h1>Acacia diffusa var. cuspidata</h1>
<p>Acacia diffusa var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often narrow and slightly serrated. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia diffusa var. cuspidata has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, feathery leaflets arranged in pairs along the stems, giving it a delicate appearance; the leaves are typically green, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is often grey or brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are yellow and consist of small, globular inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia diffusa var. cuspidata is a shrub native to eastern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, where it has been introduced for ornamental or ecological purposes. This plant thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 50 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, though its conservation status is generally stable in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia diffusa var. cuspidata is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination. This plant grows best in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal watering once established.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can help repel pests and enhance growth.</p>
