<p>Arenaria diffusa, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by yellowish fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are typically rounded and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria diffusa is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
