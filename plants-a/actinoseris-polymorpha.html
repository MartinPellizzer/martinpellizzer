                <h1>Actinoseris polymorpha</h1>
<p>Actinoseris polymorpha, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has a succulent, branching stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring thick leaves and a deep root system.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoseris polymorpha has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically spoon-shaped or spatulate, arranged in a basal rosette, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green or grayish coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, low-profile form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring radial symmetry with yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris polymorpha is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in states like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with desert environments. It is also present in parts of Baja California and Sonora.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris polymorpha was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the intertidal zone. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in areas with moderate to high salinity. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and anthropogenic environments.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species in these regions, though it has become integrated into local ecosystems.</p>
