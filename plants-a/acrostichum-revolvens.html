                <h1>Acrostichum revolvens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum revolvens, commonly known as the walking fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its distinctive growth habit.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome that produces upright, branching fronds with a feathery appearance. The plant is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly the Caribbean and parts of Central America. Its leaves are typically green and have a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum revolvens is known for its ability to "walk" by growing new fronds at the tip of its rhizome, which can eventually detach and establish new plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum revolvens has long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, spherical drupe containing one seed, which is dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum revolvens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and consistent rainfall. Its distribution includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum revolvens was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, marshes, and wetlands where it forms dense stands. This plant has been reported in several countries including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often classified as a noxious weed in certain regions.</p>
