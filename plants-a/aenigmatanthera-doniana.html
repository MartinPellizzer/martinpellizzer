<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories or near water sources. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
