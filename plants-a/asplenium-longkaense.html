<p>Asplenium longkaense, commonly known as the longkaense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium longkaense is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
