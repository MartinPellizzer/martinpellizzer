                    <h1>Anastraphia northropiana</h1>
<p>Anastraphia northropiana, commonly known as the Northrop's anastraphia, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a spreading habit that allows it to thrive in shaded undergrowth. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Anastraphia northropiana is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks across its native range.</p>
