<p>Aristolochia hirta, commonly known as the hairy Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves and unique, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, round berries that mature to a dark purple hue, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy, sticky coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its attractive foliage and unusual floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic to humans and animals.</p>
