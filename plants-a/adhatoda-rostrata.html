<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that are typically clustered in cymes. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Adhatoda rostrata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda rostrata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels off in flakes. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to September, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda rostrata is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda rostrata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda rostrata is a medicinal plant known for its ornamental and therapeutic uses.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are essential. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda rostrata is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other medicinal and ornamental species in traditional gardens. Its deep roots help in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
