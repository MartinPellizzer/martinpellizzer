                    <h1>Alliaria oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Alliaria oppositifolia, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from sulfur-containing compounds in its leaves and roots. It has a shallow root system and spreads primarily through seed dispersal, often becoming invasive in new environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native and non-native ranges.</p>
