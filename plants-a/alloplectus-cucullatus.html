<p>Alloplectus cucullatus, commonly known as the hooded bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has slender, branching stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces tiny, white flowers.</p>
<p>Alloplectus cucullatus is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting small organisms.</p>
