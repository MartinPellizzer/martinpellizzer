<p>Allocarya oricola, commonly known as the purple-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet or purple petals that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in a dense spike, and it is pollinated by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Allocarya oricola is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
