                <h1>Adiantum lunulatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum lunulatum, commonly known as the moon's shadow fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its identification.</p>
<p>Adiantum lunulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum lunulatum has fern-like leaves that are bi-lobed, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a bright green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, with a slender, wiry stem that is smooth and slightly glossy. It does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant rather than a flowering plant. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaves, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor it to the substrate, often found in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lunulatum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It can be found in states such as Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks and in forest understories. It is commonly found in rocky or sandy soils with high humidity.</p>
<p>Adiantum lunulatum is also present in parts of eastern Mexico, including the states of Veracruz and Puebla.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lunulatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest margins and along stream banks. Although not considered invasive, it has spread beyond cultivation in some areas.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
