                <h1>Achyranthes gracilis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes gracilis, commonly known as slender cowtail, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in spikes, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes gracilis has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 2–6 cm long and 0.5–2 cm wide, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a creeping or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pale green to white petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes gracilis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in the understory of dense vegetation. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, though its primary range remains in Asia.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes gracilis was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its seeds.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
