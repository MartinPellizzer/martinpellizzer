                    <h1>Asplenium namibicum</h1>
<p>Asplenium namibicum, commonly known as the Namibian spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and southern Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and sandstone outcrops, where it has adapted to extreme drought conditions by reducing water loss through its specialized leaf structure. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium namibicum is a rare and endangered species, making it a significant subject of botanical study in arid ecosystems.</p>
