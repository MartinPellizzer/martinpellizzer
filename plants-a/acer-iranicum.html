<p>Acer iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, featuring a slender trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras (winged seeds) for dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
