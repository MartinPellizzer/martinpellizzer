                <h1>Acer iranicum</h1>
<p>Acer iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring a slender trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras (winged seeds) for dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer iranicum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, and they are typically 5–10 cm long and 3–6 cm wide, turning bright yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a single trunk. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green sepals and no petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind after maturing in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky soils and helping to prevent erosion.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer iranicum is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Iran.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Zagros and Alborz mountain ranges. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas with a temperate climate. The plant typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited range, Acer iranicum is considered critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer iranicum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer iranicum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in early summer and leaf drop in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like rosemary or lavender can help deter pests and improve air circulation.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer iranicum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to the local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting a diverse range of flora. Its deep root system helps in erosion control by holding the soil together, especially on slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer iranicum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor traditional uses in local cuisines. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though research is limited. Industrially, its timber is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, the plant holds symbolic importance in its native regions, often representing resilience and the beauty of mountainous landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer iranicum has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atropurpureum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids of Acer iranicum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>They are particularly favored in regions with cooler climates for their unique leaf patterns and seasonal displays.</p>
