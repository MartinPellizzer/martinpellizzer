<p>Alsophila smithii, commonly known as the Smith's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fertile fronds that produce spores, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy material that provides structural support and helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Alsophila smithii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
