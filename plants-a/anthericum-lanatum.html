                    <h1>Anthericum lanatum</h1>
<p>Anthericum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Anthericum lanatum is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
