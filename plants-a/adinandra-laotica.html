                <h1>Adinandra laotica</h1>
<p>Adinandra laotica, commonly known as the Laotian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, often in humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Adinandra laotica is valued for its durable timber and is also of interest in ecological studies due to its role in local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra laotica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra laotica is primarily native to Laos and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the undergrowth of dense forests. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra laotica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, Vietnam, and Laos.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas where the climate is warm and humid. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and small flowers. It has also been introduced to some regions outside its native range for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains primarily confined to its native habitat with limited spread in non-native areas.</p>
