                <h1>Adenocarpus tenoreanus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus tenoreanus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus tenoreanus is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus tenoreanus has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are generally dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus tenoreanus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, such as coastal areas, cliffs, and dry slopes. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with limestone substrates. It is well adapted to withstand hot, dry conditions and can be found in various habitats including scrublands and maquis vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus tenoreanus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in parts of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It has been reported in several invasive plant databases due to its rapid spread and potential ecological impact.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land clearing and seed dispersal through livestock.</p>
