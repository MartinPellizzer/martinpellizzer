                <h1>Achneria pallida</h1>
<p>Achneria pallida, commonly known as the pale achneria, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its botanical name reflects its pale coloration, which is characteristic of both its flowers and foliage.</p>
<p>Achneria pallida is often found in swampy areas and is adapted to thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria pallida has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, bluish-green upper surface and a pale white underside; they are typically 3-5 cm in length and 1.5-2.5 cm in width.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a light green to yellowish bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria pallida is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and in wetlands. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern coastal plain region. It is often associated with pine flatwoods and other wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southeastern United States, where it plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria pallida was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its presence can indicate the health of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its showy white flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
