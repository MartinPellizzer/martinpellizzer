                    <h1>Arabidopsis rupicola</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis rupicola, commonly known as the rock Arabidopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species like Arabidopsis thaliana. This plant is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and hairy leaves adapted to arid environments. It typically grows on rocky substrates and is often found in high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and genetic simplicity, it is of interest to researchers studying plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
