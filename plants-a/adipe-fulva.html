                <h1>Adipe fulva</h1>
<p>Adipe fulva, commonly known as the fat plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are typically small and rounded, contributing to its overall compact form.</p>
<p>Adipe fulva is well-suited for rock gardens or as a potted plant due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipe fulva has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading growth pattern. Its small, fragrant flowers are white with yellow stamens, arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and helping the plant thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe fulva is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical rainforests and humid environments, often growing along riverbanks and in shaded undergrowth. This plant is commonly found in lowland areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe fulva was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Northwest due to its adaptability to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading along forest floors and in disturbed areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have raised concerns among conservationists. Its introduction is believed to be a result of accidental dispersal through human activity, such as horticultural trade or landscaping practices.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to monitor its spread and assess its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
