                <h1>Adenocalymma pachypus</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma pachypus, commonly known as the broad-leaved adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is typically found in moist, forested areas and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma pachypus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma pachypus has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma pachypus is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical rainforests and coastal areas of these regions. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments along the edges of forests and in rocky outcrops. It is often associated with sandy or clay soils in coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the humid and temperate climate of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma pachypus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as land clearing and urban development.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in degraded landscapes. This plant has been reported in several regions of Australia, particularly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered to have a low impact compared to other introduced species.</p>
