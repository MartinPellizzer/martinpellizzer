                    <h1>Anax</h1>
<p>Anax, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are typically thick and waxy, helping to support the plant's weight and reduce water loss. Anax species have roots that anchor them in the muddy substrate, while their rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
