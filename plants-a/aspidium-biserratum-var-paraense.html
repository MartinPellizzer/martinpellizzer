                    <h1>Aspidium biserratum var. paraense</h1>
<p>Aspidium biserratum var. paraense, commonly known as the Paraense water fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
