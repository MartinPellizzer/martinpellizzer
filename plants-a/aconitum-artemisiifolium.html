                <h1>Aconitum artemisiifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum artemisiifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and palmately compound leaves that resemble those of the Artemisia genus. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum artemisiifolium has compound, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, resembling the leaves of Artemisia, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, hairy, and have a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense racemes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and three smaller petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum artemisiifolium is primarily native to Manchuria.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of northeastern China, including parts of the Korean Peninsula and southeastern Siberia. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with temperate climates and is often found in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its striking blue or purple flowers and is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum artemisiifolium was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was popular in gardens and landscapes for its blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it can alter soil chemistry and reduce biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its spread and prevent further invasion.</p>
