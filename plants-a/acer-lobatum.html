                <h1>Acer lobatum</h1>
<p>Acer lobatum, commonly known as the Sierra maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobes and turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>Acer lobatum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a lobed base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 5-10 cm in length, and change from bright green in spring to vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips as the tree ages. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America, specifically found in parts of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other areas, including parts of Europe and Asia, where it is cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within mixed forests. This species typically occurs at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where it benefits from cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its restricted native habitat makes it vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique lobed leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree also acts as a companion plant, supporting biodiversity in mixed forests. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lobatum offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing shade, which helps regulate microclimates in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers have been historically used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it has limited direct economic use. Culturally, it is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and is often planted in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and natural beauty, making it a popular choice for landscape design.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, such as 'Gum Drop' and 'Bailii', which are known for their striking red foliage and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It also has natural hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the genus. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness or more vibrant autumn colors. Horticulturally, Acer lobatum is valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of climates and its contribution to landscape design.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids play an important role in both ornamental horticulture and ecological landscaping.</p>
