<p>Acer lobatum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is often smooth and gray, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>Acer lobatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions and forested areas.</p>
