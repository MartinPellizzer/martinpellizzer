                <h1>Acer lobatum</h1>
<p>Acer lobatum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is often smooth and gray, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>Acer lobatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions and forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5-10 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution is limited due to habitat loss and fragmentation. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as temperate forests and mountain slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from deforestation, Acer lobatum is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer lobatum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter, with vibrant autumn foliage marking the transition.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, and planting it with companion species such as lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lobatum plays a role in carbon sequestration, supporting overall environmental health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum is a species of maple tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional properties. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some cultures for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and carving.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in local art and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Baillyi' and 'Variegatum', known for their unique foliage patterns and compact growth. Hybrids of Acer lobatum are often created to enhance traits such as color, disease resistance, and adaptability to different climates. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and as specimen trees in both public and private gardens.</p>
