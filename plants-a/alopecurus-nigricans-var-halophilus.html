                    <h1>Alopecurus nigricans var. halophilus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus nigricans var. halophilus, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophytic perennial grass native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats, demonstrating remarkable tolerance to high soil salinity. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty conditions.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
