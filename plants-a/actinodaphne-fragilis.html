<p>Actinodaphne fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant nutmeg tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, and its bark is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne fragilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne fragilis has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface.

<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of the Malay Peninsula. It thrives in humid and shaded environments within lowland forests. Actinodaphne fragilis is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Malaya due to its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne fragilis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it prefers well-drained, fertile soils. This plant is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves and ornamental value, making it a popular choice in horticulture. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited by its specific ecological requirements and climate preferences.</p>
