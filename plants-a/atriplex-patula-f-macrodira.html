                    <h1>Atriplex patula f. macrodira</h1>
<p>Atriplex patula f. macrodira, commonly known as the large-leaf saltbush, is a variant of the saltbush species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, succulent leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically lobed or serrated, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>This form is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
