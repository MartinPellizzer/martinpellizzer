<p>Astragalus incanus subsp.</p>
<p>incanus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
