<p>Acetosella arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider plant or woolly sorrel, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, Acetosella arachnoidea is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
