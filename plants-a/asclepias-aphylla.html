                    <h1>Asclepias aphylla</h1>
<p>Asclepias aphylla, commonly known as the leafless milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with only a slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are adapted for pollination by moths and other nocturnal insects. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies.</p>
<p>Asclepias aphylla plays a crucial role in supporting pollinator populations and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
