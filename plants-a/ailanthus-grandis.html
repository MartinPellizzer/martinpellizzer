                    <h1>Ailanthus grandis</h1>
<p>Ailanthus grandis, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with 12 to 45 pairs of pinnate leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins. The tree is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, particularly after rain, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, three-lobed winged structure that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Ailanthus grandis is often considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
