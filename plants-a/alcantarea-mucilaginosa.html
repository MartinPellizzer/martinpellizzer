<p>Alcantarea mucilaginosa, commonly known as the mucilaginous alcantara, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy, waxy leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a distinctive blue or purple hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
