                        <h1>Acacia buchananii</h1>
<p>Acacia buchananii, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, globular flower heads that appear in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia buchananii is also valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia buchananii is primarily native to the savannas and grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in open woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have a dry season and seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia buchananii was mainly introduced to regions with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is commonly used for erosion control and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has also been associated with efforts to rehabilitate degraded lands.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
