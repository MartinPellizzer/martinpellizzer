                    <h1>Agropyron pectinatum var. dagnae</h1>
<p>Agropyron pectinatum var. dagnae, commonly known as Dagnae's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
