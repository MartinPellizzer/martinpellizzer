                    <h1>Aloe tauri</h1>
<p>Aloe tauri, commonly known as the Taurine aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that are covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating. Aloe tauri blooms with yellow flowers that emerge from the base of the plant, often in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
