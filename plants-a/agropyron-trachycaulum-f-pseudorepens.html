                    <h1>Agropyron trachycaulum f. pseudorepens</h1>
<p>Agropyron trachycaulum f. pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fine, blue-green leaves and produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that mature into seeds. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is considered a valuable forage plant in dryland ecosystems.</p>
