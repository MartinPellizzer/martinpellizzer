                <h1>Acronychia foveata</h1>
<p>Acronychia foveata, commonly known as the rough-leaved acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its thick, rough-textured bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in rainforests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia foveata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and dropping.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia foveata is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the northeastern and central regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and in coastal lowlands. The plant is part of the Burseraceae family and is known for its distinctive bark and foliage.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island of New Guinea, with limited occurrences in nearby regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia foveata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly adaptable to different environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
