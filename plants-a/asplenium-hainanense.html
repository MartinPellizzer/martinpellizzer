<p>Asplenium hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium hainanense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
