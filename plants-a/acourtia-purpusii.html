                <h1>Acourtia purpusii</h1>
<p>Acourtia purpusii, commonly known as the purple thimble cactus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, spiny stems and clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia purpusii has small, hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with fine hairs, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the capsule dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia purpusii is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal and sandy habitats within these regions. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and mild climates. Acourtia purpusii is often associated with dune environments and coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within these Mexican regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia purpusii was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dunes and along the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity and wind exposure. This plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through wind-dispersed seeds and can form dense stands that alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal environments.</p>
