                <h1>Achyropsis oxyuris</h1>
<p>Achyropsis oxyuris, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh desert environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil.</p>
<p>Achyropsis oxyuris plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropsis oxyuris has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and a distinct central stamen, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis oxyuris is primarily native to the southern regions of Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape Province, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open, sun-exposed areas. It is part of the Apiaceae family and is known for its small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis oxyuris was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and arid conditions, often as a result of human activity or accidental transport.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with low moisture and full sun exposure, making it a common invader in degraded habitats. This plant has been reported in several regions across the southwestern United States and parts of northern Mexico. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other more aggressive invasive species.</p>
