                <h1>Aeglopsis alexandrae</h1>
<p>Aeglopsis alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's corymbia, is a rare shrub native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences and small, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeglopsis alexandrae has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
