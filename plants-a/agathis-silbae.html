                    <h1>Agathis silbae</h1>
<p>Agathis silbae, commonly known as the Silba's Agathis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The tree produces large, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. Agathis silbae is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which has been historically used in construction and furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
