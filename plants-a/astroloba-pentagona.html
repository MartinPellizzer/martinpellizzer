<p>Astroloba pentagona, commonly known as the star-shaped bulbous plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Astroloba pentagona is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
