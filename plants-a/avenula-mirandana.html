<p>Avenula mirandana, commonly known as the fairy grass, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical structure is simple, with a short stem and fibrous roots adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Avenula mirandana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
