<p>It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with shrublands and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena argentea var. contracta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and compact growth habit.
