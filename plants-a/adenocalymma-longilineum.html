                <h1>Adenocalymma longilineum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma longilineum, commonly known as the long-stemmed adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma longilineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma longilineum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma longilineum is primarily native to Bolivia and northern Brazil.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The species is adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma longilineum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system and seed production, outcompeting native vegetation. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, farms, and abandoned land.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a significant threat to local biodiversity and ecosystem balance.</p>
