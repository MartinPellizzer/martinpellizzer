<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes and ecological restoration projects.</p>
