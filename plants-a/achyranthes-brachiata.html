                <h1>Achyranthes brachiata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes brachiata, commonly known as horse date or Chinese knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with erect, branched stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by triangular, bead-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achyranthes brachiata is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes brachiata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5–15 cm long and 2–6 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat woody, and have a rough, fibrous bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light, aiding in their spread.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes brachiata is primarily native to South and Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments like forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in wetlands and disturbed soils. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Its adaptability allows it to spread to various habitats, contributing to its wide native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes brachiata was mainly introduced to regions with warm and humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often seen along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, such as trade and cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered an invasive species in most of these regions.</p>
