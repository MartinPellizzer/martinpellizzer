                <h1>Acronychia superba</h1>
<p>Acronychia superba, commonly known as the rock apple or mountain apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its rugged, shrub-like appearance with rough, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Acronychia superba is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia superba has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring around 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a sympodial growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing a single seed, and it is dispersed by animals that consume the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia superba is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and moist coastal areas, particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with the understorey of eucalyptus and rainforest communities.</p>
<p>Acronychia superba is also known to grow in Papua New Guinea, extending its native range into the western Pacific.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia superba was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Australia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
