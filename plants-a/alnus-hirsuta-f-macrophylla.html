                    <h1>Alnus hirsuta f. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Alnus hirsuta f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Alnus hirsuta. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
