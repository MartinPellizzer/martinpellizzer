                <h1>Acrocarpidium guayaquillense</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium guayaquillense, commonly known as the Guayaquil acrocarp, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the humid tropical regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are compound, with a finely divided structure, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium guayaquillense has elongated, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium guayaquillense is primarily native to the humid lowland forests of western Ecuador, specifically in the Andean region around the city of Guayaquil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in the understory of tropical rainforests, often growing near the base of trees. Its distribution is limited to a small geographic range, making it a regionally significant species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium guayaquillense was mainly introduced to the Pacific coastal regions of Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils near riverbanks and forest edges. This plant has been observed in both natural and disturbed habitats, indicating its adaptability to different ecological conditions. Its introduction has been documented in conservation areas, suggesting a potential role in local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to determine its impact on native flora.</p>
