                    <h1>Arundo airoides</h1>
<p>Arundo airoides, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, hollow stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable habitat for wildlife and a potential invasive species.</p>
<p>The flowering stems produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in panicles, typical of the grass family.</p>
