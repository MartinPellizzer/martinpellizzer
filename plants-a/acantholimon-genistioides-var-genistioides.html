                    <h1>Acantholimon genistioides var. genistioides</h1>
<p>Acantholimon genistioides var. genistioides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
