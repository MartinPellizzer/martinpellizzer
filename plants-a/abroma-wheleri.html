                <h1>Abroma wheleri</h1>
<p>Abroma wheleri, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer and autumn. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abroma wheleri has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a deep green color that may turn reddish in colder conditions. The stem is upright, somewhat woody with a smooth, greyish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, featuring showy white to pale yellow petals and a prominent yellow center, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, while the roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma wheleri is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern China and northern India, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as undergrowth in tropical forests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Abroma wheleri is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abroma wheleri is a hardy, fast-growing shrub known for its vibrant flowers and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abroma wheleri is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Abroma wheleri contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining habitat structure in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
