                    <h1>Acridocarpus excelsus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, aromatic fruits. It is valued for its timber and has been traditionally used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions.</p>
