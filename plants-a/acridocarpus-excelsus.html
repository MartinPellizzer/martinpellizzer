<p>Acridocarpus excelsus, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, aromatic fruits. It is valued for its timber and has been traditionally used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with five petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and moist forests of the island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. This plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to Madagascar, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions where it can thrive in humid and warm environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of Australia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate various soil types. It has also been introduced to certain regions as a potential ornamental or for ecological restoration purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited to areas where it can receive adequate sunlight and moisture.</p>
