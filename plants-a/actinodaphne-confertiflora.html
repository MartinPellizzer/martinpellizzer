                <h1>Actinodaphne confertiflora</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruit is a small, ovoid drupe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its essential oils and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne confertiflora has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, pale grey bark that exudes a fragrant resin when cut, and it grows as an evergreen tree with a straight, upright form. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and stabilizing the tree in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne confertiflora is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Borneo and the western Pacific islands, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. This species prefers lowland and hill forest environments, often growing in shaded, moist undergrowth. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Actinodaphne confertiflora is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne confertiflora is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings often yielding faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize it with a balanced slow-release fertilizer during the growing season, and prune to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or fungal issues if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a tropical garden.</p>
