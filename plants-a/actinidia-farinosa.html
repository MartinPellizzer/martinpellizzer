                <h1>Actinidia farinosa</h1>
<p>Actinidia farinosa, commonly known as the fuzzy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer or early autumn. These berries are often used in jams and wines due to their tart flavor.</p>
<p>Actinidia farinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia farinosa has compound leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and typically measure 5â€“15 cm in length, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, and have a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with separate male and female parts, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a yellowish, fuzzy berry that matures in late summer, and the seeds are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and relatively shallow, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia farinosa is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of this area. The plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity. It is often seen in forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of southeastern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia farinosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and berries. However, it has since spread rapidly in natural areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect native biodiversity.</p>
