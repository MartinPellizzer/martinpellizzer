<p>Acrostichum accedens, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red stems, which are covered in a sponge-like tissue that aids in gas exchange. The plant has specialized roots called pneumatophores that emerge from the soil to facilitate oxygen absorption in waterlogged environments. It thrives in saline and brackish water, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
