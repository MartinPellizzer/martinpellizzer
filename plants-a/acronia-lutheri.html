                <h1>Acronia lutheri</h1>
<p>Acronia lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Acronia lutheri thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, tropical climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected reserves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia lutheri has leaves that are oval-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size of about 5-7 cm in length and a waxy, dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia lutheri is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically the coastal plain regions of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained environments such as dunes, beaches, and marshes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia lutheri was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in shaded, humid conditions. This plant has been documented in several states, including Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. Its introduction is believed to be due to natural dispersal through wind and water.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains under study.</p>
