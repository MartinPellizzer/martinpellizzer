<p>Aegilops ovata subsp.</p>
<p>brachyathera, commonly known as the short awn wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the florets. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in wheat improvement and as a source of genetic diversity.</p>
