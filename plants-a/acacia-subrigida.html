                        <h1>Acacia subrigida</h1>
<p>Acacia subrigida, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are densely covered with small, stiff hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically borne at the ends of branches. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia subrigida is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia subrigida belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many early-diverging lineages with diverse morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and produce legume-like fruits. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by the distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny appearance and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia subrigida, a specific type of acacia known for its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.</p>
