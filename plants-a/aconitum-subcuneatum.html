                <h1>Aconitum subcuneatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum subcuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a robust root system and grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum subcuneatum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum subcuneatum has basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged in a basal rosette, and are typically dark green with a bluish tinge.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are blue to violet, arranged in dense spikes, and have five petals with a spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum subcuneatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This species is commonly associated with mountainous areas in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Aconitum subcuneatum is an important part of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum subcuneatum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and ornamental plant cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant has become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the eastern United States. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into native habitats.</p>
