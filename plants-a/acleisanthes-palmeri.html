                <h1>Acleisanthes palmeri</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes palmeri, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with slender, hairy stems and trumpet-shaped, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth cycle and ability to bloom quickly after rainfall make it a characteristic species of desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes palmeri has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is usually slender, with a smooth, somewhat woody texture and a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, typically pink or red in color, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes palmeri is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n, and parts of Coahuila. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open landscapes. The species is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of this region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes palmeri was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in desert and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. The plant is known for its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring. It has been documented in several protected areas and natural reserves due to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
