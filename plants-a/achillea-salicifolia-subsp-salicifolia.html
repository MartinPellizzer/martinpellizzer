<p>salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, slightly medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and appearance make it a distinctive and hardy member of the Achillea genus.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea salicifolia subsp.</p>
<p>salicifolia has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside. The stems are upright, slender, and hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads that bloom in early summer, with a discoid structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
