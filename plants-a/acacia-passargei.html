                        <h1>Acacia passargei</h1>
<p>Acacia passargei, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous tiny leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acacia passargei plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia passargei is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, particularly in the areas of the Namib Desert and the Western Cape. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dunes. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its deep root system and ability to withstand long periods of drought.</p>
<p>Acacia passargei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia passargei was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and capacity to fix nitrogen in the soil. It has been successfully established in several countries with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness.</p>
