                <h1>Acrostichum costatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum costatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum costatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum costatum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated and dark green, with a feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows rapidly in dense clusters. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically white or green, which bloom in the spring and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a spadix that develops into a cluster of small, dark berries, dispersing seeds through animal ingestion.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor in wet, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum costatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other wetland habitats. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often growing along shorelines and estuaries. Its distribution extends from the Caribbean islands to the eastern coast of South America.</p>
<p>It is also present in some regions of the southeastern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum costatum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Florida and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in salt marshes and tidal flats where it thrives in brackish water conditions. This plant has been established in these areas for several decades, often growing in dense stands along the shoreline. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been documented.</p>
