                    <h1>Ambrosia paniculata f. dissecta</h1>
<p>Ambrosia paniculata f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
