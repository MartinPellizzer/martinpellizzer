                    <h1>Allium trachypus</h1>
<p>Allium trachypus, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and broad, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a useful vegetable in culinary applications.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other Allium species such as garlic or leeks.</p>
