<p>Alsophila ursina, commonly known as the bear's paw fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, broad, wedge-shaped base that resembles a bear's paw, hence its common name. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
