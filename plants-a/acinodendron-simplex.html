                <h1>Acinodendron simplex</h1>
<p>Acinodendron simplex, commonly known as the slender acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron simplex has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron simplex is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded environments. This plant is commonly found in secondary forests and along stream banks where the soil is rich and well-drained. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron simplex was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, humid climate and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and secondary forests. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>However, its introduction may have ecological implications in non-native environments.</p>
