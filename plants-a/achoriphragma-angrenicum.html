                <h1>Achoriphragma angrenicum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma angrenicum, commonly known as the Angrenic dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma angrenicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma angrenicum has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exhibits a slight ridged texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma angrenicum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alay mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments with rocky soils and sparse vegetation. It is often found in alpine meadows and on steep slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma angrenicum was mainly introduced to Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on rocky slopes and along riverbanks. The plant is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited water availability. It has been reported in areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
