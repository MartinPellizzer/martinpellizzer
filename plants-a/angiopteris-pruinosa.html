<p>Angiopteris pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Angiopteris pruinosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic settings.</p>
