                    <h1>Amphistelma aphyllum</h1>
<p>Amphistelma aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy, orange-red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and lack of visible foliage, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems as both a host and a food source.</p>
