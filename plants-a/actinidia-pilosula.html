                <h1>Actinidia pilosula</h1>
<p>Actinidia pilosula, commonly known as the downy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a dark purple color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia pilosula has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smooth and grayish as the plant matures, and it grows as a climbing vine with tendrils. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, dispersing via birds and animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia pilosula is primarily native to China South-Central and Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, typically in forested habitats. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils in its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia pilosula was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting characteristics. The plant has since been found growing in moist, shaded areas along stream banks and in forest understories. It is considered a non-native species in these regions, though it has not become invasive.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised interest among botanists and horticulturists for its ecological and aesthetic potential.</p>
