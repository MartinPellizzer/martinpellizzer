                    <h1>Acronia upanoensis</h1>
<p>Acronia upanoensis, commonly known as the Upano mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as dipterocarps, through specialized haustoria that extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acronia upanoensis plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
