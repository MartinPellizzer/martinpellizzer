                <h1>Adicea fasciata</h1>
<p>Adicea fasciata, commonly known as the spotted adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a prominent midrib, while the stems are usually covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adicea fasciata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its visual interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea fasciata has leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea fasciata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea fasciata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread in these areas. It often thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions.</p>
