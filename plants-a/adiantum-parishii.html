                <h1>Adiantum parishii</h1>
<p>Adiantum parishii, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that turn golden in the autumn. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its intricate, lace-like foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Adiantum parishii is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its air-purifying properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum parishii has fern-like leaves that are typically triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and range in size from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a bright green color and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The stem is slender and often grows horizontally, with a smooth, light green bark.</p>
<p>Adiantum parishii produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that contains tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum parishii is primarily native to Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the northern and western parts. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Myanmar.</p>
<p>Adiantum parishii is a rare and localized plant, with a restricted range within the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum parishii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. This fern is often seen in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in most of its range.</p>
