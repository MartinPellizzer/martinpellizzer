                <h1>Adonis citrina</h1>
<p>Adonis citrina, commonly known as the yellow pheasant's eye, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to the landscape.</p>
<p>Adonis citrina is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in use.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis citrina has leaves that are alternate, simple, and lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are yellow, tubular, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis citrina is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, and Greece.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Adonis citrina is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis citrina was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize open areas, including roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a potential threat to native vegetation.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
