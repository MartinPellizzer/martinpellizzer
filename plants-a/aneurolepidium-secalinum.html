                    <h1>Aneurolepidium secalinum</h1>
<p>Aneurolepidium secalinum, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock.</p>
