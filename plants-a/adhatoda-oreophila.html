                <h1>Adhatoda oreophila</h1>
<p>Adhatoda oreophila, commonly known as the mountain adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adhatoda oreophila is valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in treating respiratory and digestive ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda oreophila has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 3-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda oreophila is primarily native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this biodiversity hotspot. The plant thrives in humid and tropical climates, often growing in dense forests. It is commonly observed at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>This species is also present in parts of Sri Lanka and southern Nepal.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda oreophila was mainly introduced to regions with suitable tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The plant has been introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It is also occasionally cultivated for traditional medicinal purposes in certain areas.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
