                    <h1>Anacampseros fissa</h1>
<p>Anacampseros fissa, commonly known as the fissured stonecress, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anacampseros fissa is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance.</p>
