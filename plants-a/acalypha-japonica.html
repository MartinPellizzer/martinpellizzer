                        <h1>Acalypha japonica</h1>
<p>Acalypha japonica, commonly known as Japanese ironweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, spiky inflorescences that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinct reddish or purple underside.</p>
<p>Acalypha japonica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha japonica is primarily native to East Asia, including Japan, Korea, and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forest understories and along stream banks in these regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with temperate climates. It is also present in some regions of Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha japonica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its vibrant leaves. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have made it a challenge for ecological management.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread while minimizing harm to the environment.</p>
