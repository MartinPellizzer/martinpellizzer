                    <h1>Acer cucullobracteatum</h1>
<p>Acer cucullobracteatum, commonly known as the hooded maple, is a rare and unique species of maple native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, hood-like bracts that surround the flowers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are typically red or orange in color. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a coarsely toothed margin, and they turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer cucullobracteatum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
