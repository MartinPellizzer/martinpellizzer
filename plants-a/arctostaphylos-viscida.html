<p>Arctostaphylos viscida, commonly known as the sticky madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, reddish bark and glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The sticky resin on its leaves and stems gives it its common name and helps protect it from herbivores.</p>
