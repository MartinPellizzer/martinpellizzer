                    <h1>Asplenium cuspidatum var. foeniculaceum</h1>
<p>Asplenium cuspidatum var. foeniculaceum, commonly known as the carrot fern, is a perennial fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble the foliage of a carrot, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported astringent properties.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, kidney-shaped sorus clusters on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
