<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their primitive vascular structures and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Lamiales, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as mint and snapdragon. Its family is Acanthaceae, commonly known as the acanthus family, which includes plants with showy flowers and often hairy leaves. Its genus is Acanthus, a group of flowering plants known for their distinctive spiny leaves and showy bracts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acanthus caroli-alexandri, a specific type of acanthus plant native to certain regions of Europe, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus caroli-alexandri is primarily native to Albania and Greece.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the coastal regions and rocky areas of these countries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with Mediterranean climates. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus caroli-alexandri was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and architectural form.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated areas in regions with temperate climates. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some naturalized habitats, particularly in coastal and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its tolerance to moderate drought conditions.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside of cultivated areas is limited compared to other invasive species.</p>
