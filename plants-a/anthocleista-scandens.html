<p>Anthocleista scandens, commonly known as the climbing arrowroot, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique growth form.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes due to its specific growing requirements.</p>
