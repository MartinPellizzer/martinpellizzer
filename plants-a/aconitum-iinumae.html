<p>Aconitum iinumae, commonly known as the Japanese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are hairy on the underside.</p>
<p>Aconitum iinumae contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum iinumae has large, palmately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a jagged leaflet shape.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure that attracts pollinators; they bloom in late summer and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
