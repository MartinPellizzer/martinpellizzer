                <h1>Aconitum superbum</h1>
<p>Aconitum superbum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that resemble a hood, which are arranged in a raceme. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Aconitum superbum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum superbum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically large, with a deep green color and serrated edges.</p>
