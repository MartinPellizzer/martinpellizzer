<p>Acalypha beckii, commonly known as the red hot poker or fireplant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are usually opposite, simple, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acalypha beckii thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha beckii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a vibrant green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha beckii is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar, where it occurs in specific regions of the eastern rainforests.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to these areas, though it may be found in some cultivated collections outside its native range. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically found in lowland to montane forests. Acalypha beckii is found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha beckii is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal traits. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. Acalypha beckii is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It pairs well with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ornamental grasses in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha beckii is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature. It also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a healthy ecosystem by offering habitat and resources to multiple species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acalypha beckii is a versatile plant with various uses across different fields.</p>
