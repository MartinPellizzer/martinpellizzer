                    <h1>Arundo hexandra</h1>
<p>Arundo hexandra, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near rivers, lakes, and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is both a valuable ecological resource and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
