                <h1>Actinoschoenus repens</h1>
<p>Actinoschoenus repens, commonly known as the creeping actinoschoenus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread horizontally across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat on the soil surface.</p>
<p>It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus repens has leaves that are typically narrow, linear, and slightly curved, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a grass-like green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and somewhat hairy, with a light green to pale yellowish color, growing horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dryness, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus repens is primarily native to Assam, Borneo, Cambodia, China South-Central, China Southeast, DR Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Hainan, India, Madagascar, Malaya, Mauritius, Myanmar, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Philippines, Queensland, South Australia, Sri Lanka, Sumatera, Tasmania, Thailand, Victoria, Vietnam, Western Australia, Zambia.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist environments such as wetlands and riverbanks. It is known for its creeping growth habit and is often used in traditional medicine in parts of its range. The plant's wide distribution suggests it has adapted to a variety of ecological conditions across these regions.</p>
<p>Its presence in both mainland and island territories indicates a broad dispersal capability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus repens was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through accidental transport via contaminated soil or plant material. The plant thrives in wet, muddy environments and can spread rapidly in riparian zones. Its introduction has led to the displacement of native vegetation and degradation of water quality.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
