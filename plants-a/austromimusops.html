                    <h1>Austromimusops</h1>
<p>Austromimusops, commonly known as the southern moa, is an extinct genus of flightless birds native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belonged to the family Dinornithidae, which included several large, herbivorous bird species. Austromimusops had a robust body and strong legs adapted for walking and foraging on the forest floor. Its diet likely consisted of leaves, fruits, and other plant material found in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Fossils of Austromimusops have been found in various locations across New Zealand, providing insights into the paleoecology of the region.</p>
