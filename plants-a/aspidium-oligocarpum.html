<p>Aspidium oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water Ferns (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats on the bottom of ponds or slow-moving streams. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium oligocarpum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, still or gently flowing waters.</p>
