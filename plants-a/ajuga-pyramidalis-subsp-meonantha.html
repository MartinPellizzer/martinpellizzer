<p>Ajuga pyramidalis subsp.</p>
<p>meonantha, commonly known as meadow bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it an effective ground cover plant in shaded or partially shaded environments.</p>
