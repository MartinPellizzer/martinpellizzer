                <h1>Aconitum kitadakense</h1>
<p>Aconitum kitadakense, commonly known as Japanese aconite, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens.</p>
<p>Aconitum kitadakense contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum kitadakense has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed, dark green blades that can reach up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright and reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the plant, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum kitadakense is primarily native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of Honshu, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with temperate climate zones and is often found in areas with rich, loamy soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, its distribution is relatively limited within Japan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum kitadakense was mainly introduced to Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northern regions of the country, particularly in Hokkaido and parts of Honshu. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in shaded forest environments. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
