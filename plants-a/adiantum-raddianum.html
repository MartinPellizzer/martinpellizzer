                <h1>Adiantum raddianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum raddianum, commonly known as the rattan fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional crafts, particularly in the production of rattan furniture.</p>
<p>Adiantum raddianum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum raddianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and are usually arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and are light green in color, often with a slightly glossy surface. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows along the ground or in rock crevices.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer, though they are not showy. The fruit is a dark brown, spherical capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant to rocky or moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum raddianum is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad-Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It is often found growing on rocks or in damp soil.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution suggests it is well adapted to a variety of humid climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum raddianum was mainly introduced to a wide range of regions including Assam, Azores, Belgium, Canary Is., Cape Provinces, East Himalaya, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Gilbert Is., Great Britain, Gulf of Guinea Is., Hawaii, India, Jamaica, Kenya, KwaZulu-Natal, Lesser Sunda Is., Madeira, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nansei-shoto, Nepal, Netherlands, New Guinea, Northern Provinces, Portugal, RÃ©union, Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Taiwan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This fern has been widely distributed across various continents, likely due to its adaptability and ornamental value. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. The introduction of Adiantum raddianum has been associated with horticultural trade and botanical exchanges.</p>
<p>Its presence in these areas highlights its significance as an introduced species in diverse ecosystems.</p>
