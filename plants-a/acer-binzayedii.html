                    <h1>Acer binzayedii</h1>
<p>Acer binzayedii, commonly known as the Binhazay's maple, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, making it a visually striking plant. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in forested areas at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
