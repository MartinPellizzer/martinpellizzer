                <h1>Adiantum subsulphureum</h1>
<p>Adiantum subsulphureum, commonly known as the sulfur shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with a waxy, sulfur-yellow coating, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum subsulphureum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum subsulphureum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a delicate, finely divided structure.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, bushy form. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subsulphureum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and warm temperatures. This fern is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded areas. It is often associated with rocky or disturbed soils in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the broader range of the Adiantum genus.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subsulphureum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest habitats. This fern is often seen growing along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Its introduction has been documented in several states including Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
