                    <h1>Aphyllorchis pallida</h1>
<p>Aphyllorchis pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with its photosynthetic function performed by its white, fleshy roots. The plant produces delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet, pine rockland habitats and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
