                <h1>Adiantum tryonii</h1>
<p>Adiantum tryonii, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lacy fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Adiantum tryonii is characterized by its unique, arching fronds that resemble the flowing hair of a maiden, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum tryonii has feather-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, lacy appearance, typically arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a slightly curled margin, and range in size from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and pale green, growing in a clumping pattern. Adiantum tryonii does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tryonii is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is often associated with high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Peru.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tryonii was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its delicate, fern-like foliage. It has been reported in several states, including Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland.</p>
