                        <h1>Abutilon erosum</h1>
<p>Abutilon erosum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Abutilon erosum make it well adapted to dry conditions and suitable for use in xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon erosum is primarily native to South America, specifically ranging from Brazil to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with riverbanks and coastal areas. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Panama and Colombia.</p>
<p>Abutilon erosum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon erosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, stream banks, and open woodlands. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and human activity.</p>
<p>Its presence can significantly alter local ecosystems by reducing biodiversity and altering habitat structure.</p>
