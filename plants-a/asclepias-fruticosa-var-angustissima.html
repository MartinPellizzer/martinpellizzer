                    <h1>Asclepias fruticosa var. angustissima</h1>
<p>Asclepias fruticosa var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but beneficial for monarch butterflies as a food source for their larvae.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting native pollinator populations.</p>
