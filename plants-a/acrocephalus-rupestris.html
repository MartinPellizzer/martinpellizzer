                <h1>Acrocephalus rupestris</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus rupestris, commonly known as the rock sparrow's-beak, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in open areas such as slopes and cliffs.</p>
<p>Acrocephalus rupestris is a member of the Plantaginaceae family, which includes many species adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus rupestris has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and somewhat wiry, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense clumps. Its flowers are small, spike-like clusters with three stamens and a single pistil, appearing in shades of greenish-white, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus rupestris is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats, coastal cliffs, and dry grasslands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with Mediterranean climates. It is also present in some regions of southwestern France and western Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus rupestris was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, typically in open, sunny environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along the edges of fields. This plant is commonly found in temperate regions of Europe and has been introduced to parts of North America. Its ability to grow in poor soils makes it a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and rapid establishment.</p>
