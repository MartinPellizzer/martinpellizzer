<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and water retention.</p>
<p>Acianthera cachensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera cachensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with some branching.
