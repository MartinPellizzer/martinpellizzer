                <h1>Acronia iris</h1>
<p>Acronia iris, commonly known as the blue iris, is a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple petals and three sepals that resemble petals, creating a showy floral display. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Acronia iris is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia iris has leaves that are sword-shaped, narrow, and slightly curved, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are showy, with six petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern, typically in shades of blue or violet, blooming in early spring and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia iris is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically found in states such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, wooded areas and along the edges of wetlands. This plant is commonly associated with rich, sandy soils in forested habitats. It is often found in the understory of deciduous forests where it receives partial sunlight.</p>
<p>Acronia iris is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia iris was mainly introduced to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The distribution has expanded to include parts of the Midwest and Southeast. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
