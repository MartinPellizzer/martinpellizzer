                <h1>Aegiphila anomala</h1>
<p>Aegiphila anomala, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila anomala has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky and arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
