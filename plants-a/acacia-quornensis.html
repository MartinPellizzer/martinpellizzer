                        <h1>Acacia quornensis</h1>
<p>Acacia quornensis, commonly known as the Quorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and phyllodes that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads during the warmer months, which are arranged in dense, compact clusters. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia quornensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia quornensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are typically characterized by legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, which includes plants with pod fruits and often symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive acorn-like seed pods and often used in traditional medicine and as sources of timber.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia quornensis, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
