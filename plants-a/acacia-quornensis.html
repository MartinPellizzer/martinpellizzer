                    <h1>Acacia quornensis</h1>
<p>Acacia quornensis, commonly known as the Quorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and phyllodes that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads during the warmer months, which are arranged in dense, compact clusters. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia quornensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
