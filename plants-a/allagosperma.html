<p>Allagosperma, commonly known as the "sea holly," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. The plant is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Allagosperma species are typically herbaceous, with some varieties producing succulent leaves that help them retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptation to coastal habitats make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
