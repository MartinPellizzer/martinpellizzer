                <h1>Achimenes tyrianthina</h1>
<p>Achimenes tyrianthina, commonly known as the crimson bellflower, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Achimenes tyrianthina is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its vibrant flowers and ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes tyrianthina has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth texture and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly upright. Its flowers are tubular with a distinctive two-lipped structure, typically displaying vibrant pink or red hues, and bloom from summer to autumn; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store water and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes tyrianthina is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Rondônia. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments within the dense rainforest undergrowth. It is often associated with riverine forests and areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes tyrianthina was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, care must be taken to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
