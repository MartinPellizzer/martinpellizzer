                <h1>Acroglyphe runcinata</h1>
<p>Acroglyphe runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acroglyphe, is a member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, pointed lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by dark berries as its fruit. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroglyphe runcinata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroglyphe runcinata is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with areas that experience Mediterranean-type climates. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern Nevada and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroglyphe runcinata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it can thrive in poor conditions. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants make it a significant ecological concern.</p>
