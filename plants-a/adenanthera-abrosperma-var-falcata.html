<p>Adenanthera abrosperma var. falcata, commonly known as the sicklepod or falcate sicklepod, is a tropical leguminous plant characterized by its distinctive sickle-shaped seed pods.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, South Asia, and parts of Australia. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, curved pods that split open to release the seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal.</p>
