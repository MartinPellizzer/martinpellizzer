                    <h1>Anomalanthus</h1>
<p>Anomalanthus, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The flowers themselves are small and clustered, often hidden within the showy bracts. Anomalanthus species are typically shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy.</p>
<p>These plants are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>
