                    <h1>Anthocercis caerulea</h1>
<p>Anthocercis caerulea, commonly known as the blue-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, azure-colored petals that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Anthocercis caerulea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
