                <h1>Adicea cordifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riverine habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea cordifolia has heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea cordifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is also present in parts of Madagascar and some regions of Southeast Asia. It is often associated with humid lowland forests and is known for its heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Adicea cordifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea cordifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it thrives in a variety of soil types and climates.</p>
