<p>Achillea huteri, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh climates. Its slender stems and small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Achillea huteri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea huteri has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with yellowish-white petals and a reddish base, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea huteri is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Austria, Italy, and Romania, where it thrives in rocky and grassy slopes. This species prefers well-drained soils and full sun, typically growing in open, sunny environments. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea huteri is considered a species of conservation concern, with populations threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea huteri is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, often used in garden landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming in the first year after planting and continuing to produce flowers for several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
