                <h1>Acmadenia neglecta</h1>
<p>Acmadenia neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a small shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Acmadenia neglecta is adapted to withstand drought and is relatively resistant to browsing by livestock.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia neglecta has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and consist of five petals, blooming in spring and attracting nectar-feeding insects for pollination. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia neglecta is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and temperate rainforests, as well as in moist sclerophyll forests. This plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and gullies within these forested areas.</p>
<p>Acmadenia neglecta is an understory plant, contributing to the biodiversity of native Australian flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia neglecta was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dunes and open woodlands. This plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often seen as a pioneer species in areas undergoing ecological succession.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native habitats.</p>
