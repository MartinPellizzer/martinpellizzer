                <h1>Acritopappus subtomentosus</h1>
<p>Acritopappus subtomentosus, commonly known as the silky pappus plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and a distinctive, silky pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually hairy and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its overall silvery appearance.</p>
<p>It is often found in the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus subtomentosus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2-5 cm in length, with a dark green color and a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in fine, silky hairs, and has a light green to grayish-brown color, growing upright with a branched pattern. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are yellowish-green, with a simple structure consisting of a single pistil and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are minute and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus subtomentosus is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the eastern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in humid forest areas. The species is adapted to the warm and moist climate typical of the Southeast region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the diverse ecosystems of this area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus subtomentosus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along utility lines.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate to dry conditions. The plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate, where it can establish itself quickly in bare ground. Its introduction has been noted in several states across the United States, particularly in the western and central regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly and may outcompete native vegetation in certain areas.</p>
