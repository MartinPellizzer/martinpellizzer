                <h1>Adesmia divaricata</h1>
<p>Adesmia divaricata, commonly known as the variable legume, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Adesmia divaricata is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia divaricata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia divaricata is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats including grasslands, shrublands, and along roadsides. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas, contributing to the ecological balance.</p>
<p>Adesmia divaricata is also occasionally found in parts of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia divaricata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and degraded lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often colonizing areas with low rainfall and poor soil quality. The plant is commonly found in regions of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, such as land clearing and grazing.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
