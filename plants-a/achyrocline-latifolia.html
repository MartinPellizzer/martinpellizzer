                <h1>Achyrocline latifolia</h1>
<p>Achyrocline latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Achyrocline latifolia is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline latifolia has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, ridged bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline latifolia is primarily native to Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern Andean regions of the country. This plant typically grows in humid, mountainous areas with high elevation. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within the cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats in Bolivia, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline latifolia was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, where it thrives in sandy soils and salty air.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dunes and along the shores, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded coastal areas.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
