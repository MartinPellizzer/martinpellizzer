                <h1>Aegiphila obducta</h1>
<p>Aegiphila obducta, commonly known as the velvetleaf aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or shaded areas.</p>
<p>Aegiphila obducta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila obducta has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a compact, upright form. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with tubular structures and five petals, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the dry, sandy soils where the plant is commonly found.</p>
