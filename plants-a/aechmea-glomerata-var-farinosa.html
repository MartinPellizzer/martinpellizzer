<p>Aechmea glomerata var. farinosa, commonly known as the foxtail bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and consistent humidity.</p>
