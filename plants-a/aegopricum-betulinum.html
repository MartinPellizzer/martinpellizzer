The plant typically grows in moist, shady areas and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has a taproot system and produces a distinctive, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Aegopricum betulinum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopricum betulinum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are serrated, green on top, and whitish underneath, typically measuring around 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
