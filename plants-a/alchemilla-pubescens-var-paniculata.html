                    <h1>Alchemilla pubescens var. paniculata</h1>
<p>Alchemilla pubescens var. paniculata, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in paniculate inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a useful plant for erosion control and a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
