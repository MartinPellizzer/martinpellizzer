                <h1>Acer rubrum var. coccineum</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum var. coccineum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its propagation and contribute to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. coccineum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“9 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a pyramidal growth pattern when young. It produces red flowers in panicles during late spring, with showy, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees through wind and insect pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. coccineum is a variant of the red maple tree native to the eastern United States, primarily found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions in the southeastern U.S., including parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils in riparian zones, floodplains, and mixed hardwood forests. It typically grows at low to middle elevations, ranging from sea level up to approximately 600 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its restricted range and habitat specificity make it a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. coccineum is a strikingly colorful variant of the red maple known for its vibrant red leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its ornamental appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. coccineum is a valuable component of eastern North American ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>Its showy red flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant acts as a companion species in forest understories, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. It also aids in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and supporting microbial activity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. coccineum is a strikingly colorful maple species known for its vibrant red foliage, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been historically explored for potential nutritional value. In traditional medicine, some parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to the forestry sector, providing timber for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes autumn and the changing seasons, inspiring art, literature, and ecological conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. coccineum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their vibrant fall color and ornamental value, including 'Summer Silk' and 'Crimson King'.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer x freemanii, to produce cultivars like 'Autumn Blaze' and 'Red Sunset', which exhibit enhanced fall color and improved hardiness. These hybrids and cultivars are widely used in landscaping due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal. The horticultural importance of Acer rubrum var. coccineum lies in its ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions and its contribution to urban and suburban landscapes.</p>
<p>Its popularity continues to grow among gardeners and landscapers seeking striking seasonal displays.</p>
