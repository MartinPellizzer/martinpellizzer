                <h1>Aegilops fluviatilis</h1>
<p>Aegilops fluviatilis, commonly known as the river wild oat, is a grass species native to Eurasia and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Aegilops fluviatilis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops fluviatilis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright, with a pale green color and a smooth texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing florets that are pale green to brown in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spikelet that contains small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks.</p>
