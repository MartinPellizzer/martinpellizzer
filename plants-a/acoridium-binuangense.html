                <h1>Acoridium binuangense</h1>
<p>Acoridium binuangense, commonly known as the Binuang arrowroot, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as taro and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium binuangense has broad, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with three petals and three sepals, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium binuangense is primarily native to the Philippines, specifically found in the island of Luzon.</p>
<p>It is commonly encountered in lowland and montane forest areas, particularly in the provinces of Benguet and La Union. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acoridium binuangense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium binuangense was mainly introduced to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and montane forest areas. This plant is part of the Araceae family and is known for its unique floral structures. It thrives in humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
