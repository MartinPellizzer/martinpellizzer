                <h1>Adenocalymma gracielzae</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma gracielzae, commonly known as the Cape York daisy, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma gracielzae is often found in open woodlands and is an important component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma gracielzae has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a yellowish-green color, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma gracielzae is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>This species is found in the northern regions of Brazil, particularly in the Amazon Basin. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments with high humidity and fertile soil. The plant is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats within this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the northern part of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma gracielzae was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high salinity and moderate to high temperatures. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and salt marshes along the Atlantic coast. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native species.</p>
