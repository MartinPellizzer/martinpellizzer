                    <h1>Allosorus pallidus</h1>
<p>Allosorus pallidus, commonly known as the pale alpine lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives in rocky, alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. The plant's thallus is typically crust-like, forming a tight, flat layer on rock surfaces. It is often found in high-altitude regions where temperatures are low and sunlight is intense.</p>
<p>Allosorus pallidus plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
