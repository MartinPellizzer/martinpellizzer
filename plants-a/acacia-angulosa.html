                        <h1>Acacia angulosa</h1>
<p>Acacia angulosa, commonly known as the angular acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive angular, ridged bark and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular heads, which are followed by long, slender pods. It is well adapted to drought and thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acacia angulosa is often used in traditional medicine and for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia angulosa is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and parts of Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in savannas and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Acacia angulosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia angulosa was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in semi-arid or arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well-suited for degraded or disturbed lands. The plant is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in Western Australia and South Australia. It has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Africa and the Middle East, for its use in land rehabilitation and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
