                <h1>Acer cadevallii</h1>
<p>Acer cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with distinctive ridges that become more pronounced with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, displaying a vibrant green during the growing season and turning yellow to orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure with separate sepals and petals. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over a wide area.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii is a rare and critically endangered species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to a small area within the Hengduan Mountains, where it grows in humid, temperate climates. Currently, its distribution is restricted to a few isolated populations, primarily in cloud forests at elevations between 1,800 and 2,600 meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural propagation, Acer cadevallii is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii is a unique maple species known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, making it ideal for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be moderate in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii is a rare and unique maple species that provides habitat and food for various wildlife species, including insects and birds.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination network. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating a microhabitat for smaller flora and fauna. Its deep root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer cadevallii contributes to the overall ecological balance by enhancing soil structure and promoting nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii is a rare and ornamental maple species primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional value in traditional practices. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its possible antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though research is still limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecosystem stability, supporting local wildlife and soil health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it serves as a symbol of resilience and natural beauty in regions where it is native.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are appreciated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Atrosanguineum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. The species has also been crossed with other maple species to create hybrids that offer enhanced hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, particularly in gardens and urban landscapes where they add visual interest.</p>
<p>Their adaptability and aesthetic appeal make them valuable additions to the maple family in cultivation.</p>
