                <h1>Acer cadevallii</h1>
<p>Acer cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and often displays a reddish-brown color, adding to its visual appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a moderate size, typically reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning bright red in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in early spring, with a simple structure consisting of five sepals and petals, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Europe and North America, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forested areas. It is usually found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer cadevallii is listed as critically endangered in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking red foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer cadevallii includes a period of rapid growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with flowering shrubs to enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii is a rare maple species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, early spring flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii is a rare and ornamental tree known for its unique foliage and ecological value.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in horticulture and landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in specific environmental conditions. While it is not commonly used in culinary or medicinal applications, it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and biodiversity. In some regions, it holds cultural significance as a symbol of resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution also makes it valuable for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cadevallii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Orange Glow' and 'Aureum', which are known for their vibrant yellow foliage. The species has been used in horticultural breeding to create hybrids that exhibit enhanced growth habits and coloration. These hybrids are often favored in landscapes for their adaptability and visual appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer cadevallii plays a significant role in the horticultural world due to its aesthetic qualities and genetic versatility.</p>
