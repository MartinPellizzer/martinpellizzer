                    <h1>Asplenium lunulatum var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Asplenium lunulatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate moonwort, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its intermediate morphological features between the typical A. lunulatum and other related species.</p>
