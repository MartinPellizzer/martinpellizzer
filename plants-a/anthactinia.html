                    <h1>Anthactinia</h1>
<p>Anthactinia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent species adapted to harsh environments. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that appear only at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Anthactinia is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies.</p>
