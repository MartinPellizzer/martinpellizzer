<p>Atriplex tatarica f. sporadum, commonly known as the Tatarian saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, alternate leaves that often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of trichomes. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to Central Asia and is often found in coastal and inland saline soils.</p>
