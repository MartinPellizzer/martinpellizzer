                    <h1>Asplenium odontophyllum</h1>
<p>Asplenium odontophyllum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium odontophyllum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
