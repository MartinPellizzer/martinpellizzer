                    <h1>Acrostichum huacsaro f. minus</h1>
<p>Acrostichum huacsaro f. minus, commonly known as the lesser hawksbeard fern, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than those of its parent species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
