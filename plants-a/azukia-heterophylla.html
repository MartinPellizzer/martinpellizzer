<p>Azukia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf azukia, is a flowering plant species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, lens-shaped pods. Azukia heterophylla is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to different light conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
