                <h1>Adiantum hexagonum</h1>
<p>Adiantum hexagonum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, which contributes to its common name.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum hexagonum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring up to 10 cm in length, and are a vibrant green with a slightly glossy texture. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. This plant does not produce flowers or fruits, as it is a spore-producing plant, and its reproduction occurs through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hexagonum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in shaded environments, often growing along streams or near the base of trees. It is also known to occur in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Adiantum hexagonum is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often seen in montane rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hexagonum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. The distribution has expanded along coastal regions and in areas with moist, shaded habitats. It is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and garden landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
