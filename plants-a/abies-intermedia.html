<p>Abies intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The cones of Abies intermedia are typically cone-shaped, maturing to a reddish-brown color, and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
