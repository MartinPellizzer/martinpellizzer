<p>Athyrium pulcherrimum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, deeply divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden fuzz. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
