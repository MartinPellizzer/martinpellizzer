                <h1>Adonis margaritae</h1>
<p>Adonis margaritae, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Adonis margaritae is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis margaritae has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are finely divided, with a bluish-green color and a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a central dark red or purple blotch, blooming in early spring and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis margaritae is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and adjacent inland regions, particularly in the northern and central parts of California. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It is also present in some areas of southern Oregon along the coastline.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis margaritae was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed areas. The plant is often associated with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has been reported in several counties across these regions, though its distribution is not widespread.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated and occasionally escaped into the wild.</p>
