<p>Adonis margaritae, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Adonis margaritae is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling.</p>
