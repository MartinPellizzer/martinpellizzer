<p>Aspidium hokutense, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Aspidium hokutense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
