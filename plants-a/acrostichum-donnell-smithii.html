                    <h1>Acrostichum donnell-smithii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's holly fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinct, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
