                <h1>Acrostichum donnell-smithii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's holly fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinct, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum donnell-smithii has large, feather-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum donnell-smithii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in forest understories. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions due to its particular habitat requirements.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum donnell-smithii was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it can thrive in moist, saline conditions.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions with high humidity and moderate to high temperatures. This plant is often found in areas with poor drainage, such as marshes and tidal flats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range.</p>
