                    <h1>Allantoma decandra</h1>
<p>Allantoma decandra, commonly known as the clustered allantoid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Allantoma decandra is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity in semi-arid regions.</p>
