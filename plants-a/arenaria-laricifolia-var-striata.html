<p>Arenaria laricifolia var. striata, commonly known as the striped sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its strikingly patterned leaves, which have distinct stripes, make it a visually distinctive species within the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
