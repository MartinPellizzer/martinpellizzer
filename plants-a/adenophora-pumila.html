                <h1>Adenophora pumila</h1>
<p>Adenophora pumila, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and bear small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its milky sap is a distinguishing characteristic, and it is often found in meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Adenophora pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora pumila has small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a light green to brownish color. The flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring five white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora pumila is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed areas. The plant thrives in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. It is particularly common in the Appalachian Mountains and the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Adenophora pumila is often seen growing in areas with partial shade to full sun.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora pumila was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in temperate regions. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, animals, and water, contributing to its rapid colonization of new habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
