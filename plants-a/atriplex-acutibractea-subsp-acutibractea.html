<p>Atriplex acutibractea subsp.</p>
<p>acutibractea, commonly known as the narrow-bract saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for revegetation in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for native wildlife.</p>
