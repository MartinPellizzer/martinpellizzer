                    <h1>Alyxia samoensis</h1>
<p>Alyxia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the islands of Samoa and nearby Pacific regions.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily from the families Euphorbiaceae and Rutaceae, through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red berries, which are important for local bird species. Its presence can weaken host trees over time, making it a significant ecological factor in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Alyxia samoensis plays a role in both ecological interactions and traditional uses among indigenous communities.</p>
