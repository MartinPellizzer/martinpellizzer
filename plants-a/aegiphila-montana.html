                <h1>Aegiphila montana</h1>
<p>Aegiphila montana, commonly known as the mountain aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila montana has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to purple in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
