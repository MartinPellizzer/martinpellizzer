<p>Asplenium ebeneum f. serratum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
