                    <h1>Alisma graminifolium f. strictum</h1>
<p>Alisma graminifolium f. strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a variant of the water plantain species native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to thrive in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Alismataceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along the edges of slow-moving streams.</p>
