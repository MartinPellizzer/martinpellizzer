                <h1>Achania cordata</h1>
<p>Achania cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf achania, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Achania cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achania cordata has heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a broad base and pointed tips, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length and 3-6 cm in width, and they are usually a deep green on top with a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, covered with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achania cordata is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to these regions, though it has been introduced to some parts of southern Florida. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests and coastal woodlands. Achania cordata is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 300 meters.</p>
<p>The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achania cordata is a hardy, flowering plant that is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fragrance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Achania cordata involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during the growing season, but should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
