<p>Agrostis ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as Ghiesbreght's bentgrass, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, particularly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Agrostis ghiesbreghtii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
