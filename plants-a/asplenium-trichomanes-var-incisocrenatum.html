                    <h1>Asplenium trichomanes var. incisocrenatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium trichomanes var. incisocrenatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its finely incised leaf margins and its relatively small size, making it a subtle yet resilient component of woodland and cliff habitats.</p>
