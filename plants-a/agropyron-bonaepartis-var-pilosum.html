<p>Agropyron bonaepartis var. pilosum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silky, silver-green foliage due to the dense pubescence on its blades. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in restoration projects.</p>
