                    <h1>Asterocephalus pumilus</h1>
<p>Asterocephalus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf star-headed plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, star-shaped inflorescences that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait common among many desert flora.</p>
<p>Asterocephalus pumilus is adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient example of xerophytic vegetation.</p>
