                    <h1>Asplenium × bavaricum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × bavaricum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × bavaricum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor settings.</p>
