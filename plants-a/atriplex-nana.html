<p>Atriplex nana, commonly known as dwarf saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex nana is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with poor nutrient availability.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
