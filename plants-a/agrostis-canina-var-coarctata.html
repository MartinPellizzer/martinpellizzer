                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. coarctata</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is clump-forming, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
