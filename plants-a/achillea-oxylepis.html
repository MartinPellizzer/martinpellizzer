                <h1>Achillea oxylepis</h1>
<p>Achillea oxylepis, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and flat, aromatic flower heads that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Achillea oxylepis is also noted for its ability to tolerate cold climates and high altitudes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oxylepis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and form flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxylepis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, specifically southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, as well as in open woodlands and grasslands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry, sunny habitats. Its native range includes countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the climate and environmental conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxylepis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as landscaping or accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its presence can alter native plant communities and reduce biodiversity in affected regions.</p>
