<p>Achillea oxylepis, commonly known as the Greek yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and adaptable plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oxylepis has leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a silvery-gray underside, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are compound umbels with small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's establishment and propagation.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxylepis is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of western China and has been introduced to other regions with similar climates. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and alpine environments, often growing on slopes and in meadows. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea oxylepis is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and ability to thrive in various climates.</p>
