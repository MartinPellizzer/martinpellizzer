<p>Anthocleista obanensis, commonly known as the Oban mountain euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Uganda and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a waxy texture, while its stems are often branched and covered in a fine, powdery coating.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
