<p>Aspidium distans var. oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically longer and broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in rows. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
