<p>Arrhenatherum avenaceum subsp.</p>
<p>rupestre, commonly known as the rock meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or coastal environments.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in challenging environments.</p>
