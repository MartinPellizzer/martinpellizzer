                <h1>Adonis jovinienii</h1>
<p>Adonis jovinienii, commonly known as the Alpine Adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple and trifoliate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Adonis jovinienii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis jovinienii has compound, trifoliate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are yellow, with showy, petal-like sepals and a central cluster of stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky, arid soils where the plant grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis jovinienii is primarily native to Spain.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the southern and central areas. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open landscapes or along roadsides. Its distribution is limited to certain habitats that provide the right balance of sunlight and drainage.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species, reflecting the unique ecological conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis jovinienii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant thrives in environments where it can receive ample sunlight and has good drainage, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its introduction has been noted in various parts of the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
