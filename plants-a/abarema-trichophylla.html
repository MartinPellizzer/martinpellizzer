<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema trichophylla is primarily native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans several states in eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in shaded understory environments within the forest.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Atlantic Forest due to its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema trichophylla was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, contributing to the diversity of ornamental flora in the region. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
