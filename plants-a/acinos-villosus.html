                <h1>Acinos villosus</h1>
<p>Acinos villosus, commonly known as the woolly acino, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos villosus has leaves that are typically lanceolate or elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a grayish-green color due to their dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is usually slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green to brownish color, and it grows in a spreading or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish or pale green, and consist of five sepals and petals, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos villosus is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It is also present in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.</p>
<p>Acinos villosus is often associated with mountainous regions and is adapted to cool, temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos villosus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and moderate rainfall. This plant thrives in full sun and is often seen in areas where native vegetation has been disrupted. Its presence is often associated with human activity, such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
