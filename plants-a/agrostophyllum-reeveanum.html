                    <h1>Agrostophyllum reeveanum</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum reeveanum, commonly known as the reef spongeplant, is a unique marine angiosperm found in shallow tropical and subtropical coastal waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its specialized structure that allows it to thrive in intertidal zones. The plant exhibits a sponge-like appearance due to its dense, fibrous tissue that absorbs and retains water. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect adaptations to withstand wave action and desiccation during low tide.</p>
