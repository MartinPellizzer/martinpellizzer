<p>Agrostis × lapenkoi, commonly known as the Lapland bentgrass, is a hybrid grass species that occurs naturally in the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets.</p>
<p>Agrostis × lapenkoi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is often found in tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
