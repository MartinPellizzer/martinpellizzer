                <h1>Adenostemma hirsutum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Adenostemma hirsutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma hirsutum has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dull green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with short, stiff hairs, and has a grayish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are pink to purple in color, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma hirsutum is primarily native to Java.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this island, which is part of Indonesia. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed areas. It is adapted to the warm and humid climate of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of Java.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma hirsutum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering.</p>
<p>It has since spread into native habitats, often establishing itself in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful invasion. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its competitive nature and potential to displace native vegetation.</p>
<p>Management efforts often focus on early detection and control to prevent its spread into sensitive ecosystems.</p>
