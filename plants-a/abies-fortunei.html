                        <h1>Abies fortunei</h1>
<p>Abies fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green foliage, and distinctive bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of many fir species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies fortunei is primarily native to eastern China, specifically the regions of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui provinces.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Siberia and the Korean Peninsula. This species thrives in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. It is commonly found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its distinctive cone-shaped tree form and is valued for its timber and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies fortunei was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and high altitudes, particularly in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires adequate sunlight for optimal growth. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife. However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances.</p>
