<p>Arabis decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate rockcress, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of bright green, hairy leaves that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Arabis decumbens is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
