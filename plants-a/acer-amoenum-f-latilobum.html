                <h1>Acer amoenum f. latilobum</h1>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed maple, is a variant of the Japanese maple characterized by its distinctive, broad, palmate leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green with a red or purple tinge on the underside, providing visual interest throughout the growing season. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in USDA hardiness zones 6 to 8, preferring partial shade and well-drained soil. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latilobum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow blooms that appear in clusters, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind as the seeds are released.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latilobum is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latilobum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 10-15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latilobum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a healthy ecosystem by promoting soil fertility and offering habitat for insects and other small creatures.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latilobum is a variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and sap may have limited use in traditional herbal remedies. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it lacks widespread commercial utility. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and gardens.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents natural beauty and resilience in various regional traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latilobum has a limited number of recognized varieties, but it is known for its distinctive foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their golden or variegated leaves. Hybridization with other maple species has led to the development of several cultivars with enhanced hardiness and coloration. These hybrids are often used in landscape design for their visual appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer amoenum f. latilobum holds significant horticultural importance due to its unique characteristics and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
