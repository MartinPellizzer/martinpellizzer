<p>Androsace henryi var. crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically thick, fleshy, and covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in high-altitude meadows.</p>
