<p>Agelaea everettii, commonly known as the Everett's agelaea, is a rare and little-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, and its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical in shape. Agelaea everettii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
