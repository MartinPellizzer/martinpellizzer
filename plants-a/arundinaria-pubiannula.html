<p>Arundinaria pubiannula, commonly known as the hairy bamboo, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and its distinctive hairy sheaths on the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in panicles, which are loosely branched clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs.</p>
