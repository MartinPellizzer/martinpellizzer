                    <h1>Ageria palustris</h1>
<p>Ageria palustris, commonly known as the marsh agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Ageria palustris is valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and its role in supporting wetland ecosystems.</p>
