                    <h1>Acacia seyal var. lescrauwaetii</h1>
<p>Acacia seyal var. lescrauwaetii, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange spherical flower heads, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>The bark and wood of this acacia are often used in traditional medicine and for making charcoal.</p>
