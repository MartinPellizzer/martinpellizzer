                <h1>Achillea × schroeteri</h1>
<p>Achillea × schroeteri, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (purple yarrow), resulting in a plant with distinctive floral and foliage characteristics. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, usually white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its finely divided, silver-green leaves are aromatic and often used in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Achillea × schroeteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × schroeteri has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green, slightly fuzzy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from early summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × schroeteri is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in parts of Germany and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivated areas and naturalized sites across temperate regions, though it is less common in the wild. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as meadows and rocky slopes, often found in well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 800 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare plant with a conservation status that warrants monitoring.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × schroeteri is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant, fluffy yellow flower heads and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early fall, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with more frequent irrigation during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its beauty and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
