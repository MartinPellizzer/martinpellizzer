<p>Alisma ranunculoides proles repens, commonly known as the creeping water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread vegetatively along the surface of water or moist soil. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
