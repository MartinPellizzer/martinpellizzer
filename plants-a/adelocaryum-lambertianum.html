                <h1>Adelocaryum lambertianum</h1>
<p>Adelocaryum lambertianum, commonly known as the Lambert's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its striking, pale purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific humidity and light conditions for survival. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is considered a conservation priority and is often protected in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum lambertianum has ovate, alternate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly serrated edge and a moderate size of about 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum lambertianum is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forested regions. Its distribution is closely linked to specific microhabitats within these ecosystems.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum lambertianum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It has been documented in states such as California, Nevada, and Utah, where it thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant is often found along roadsides, in gravelly areas, and in disturbed landscapes due to its adaptability. Its introduction is likely associated with human activity, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied.</p>
