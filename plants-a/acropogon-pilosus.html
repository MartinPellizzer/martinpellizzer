                <h1>Acropogon pilosus</h1>
<p>Acropogon pilosus, commonly known as the hairy acropogon, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy foliage and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, while its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems.</p>
<p>Acropogon pilosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropogon pilosus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dull green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon pilosus is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is an endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of this French overseas territory. The plant thrives in the humid and warm climate of the island's interior regions. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments within the undergrowth of primary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon pilosus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and horticulture.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, often thriving in disturbed or cultivated areas. This plant's introduction has led to its establishment in various parts of the world, including some tropical and subtropical regions. Its ability to adapt to different environmental conditions has contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains a topic of ongoing study.</p>
