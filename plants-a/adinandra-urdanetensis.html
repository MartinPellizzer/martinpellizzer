                <h1>Adinandra urdanetensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urdanet mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of red or pink. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra urdanetensis has simple, elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly ridged texture, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like manner. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra urdanetensis is primarily native to the humid lowland forests of eastern Venezuela, specifically in the state of Bol√≠var. It is found in areas with high rainfall and warm, tropical climates.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dense undergrowth, often near riverbanks or in secondary forests. Its distribution is limited to a small geographic range, making it a regionally endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra urdanetensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, typically found in montane forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
