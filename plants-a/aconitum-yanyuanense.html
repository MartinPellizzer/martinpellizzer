                <h1>Aconitum yanyuanense</h1>
<p>Aconitum yanyuanense, commonly known as the Yanyuan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum yanyuanense has leaves that are compound, typically with 5-7 lanceolate leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and are usually a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem, with a spurred structure, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, serving as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum yanyuanense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in forests, meadows, and rocky slopes, where it benefits from partial shade and well-drained soil. Its native distribution is closely associated with the Hengduan Mountains and the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum yanyuanense was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments, making it suitable for woodland gardens and naturalized areas. This plant is particularly valued for its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and planted away from livestock and children.</p>
