                    <h1>Asplenium unilaterale var. majus</h1>
<p>Asplenium unilaterale var. majus, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive tactile quality.</p>
<p>Native to the wet tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in swampy or marshy areas. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its dense appearance. It is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
