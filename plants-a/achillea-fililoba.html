                <h1>Achillea fililoba</h1>
<p>Achillea fililoba, commonly known as slender yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from its delicate appearance and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fililoba has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically 5â€“10 cm long with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and has a greenish-brown color with a smooth texture, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers (umbellate inflorescences) that bloom in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fililoba is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in Spain and Portugal. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and open woodlands, often growing in well-drained soils. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea fililoba is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fililoba is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late winter. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and entering dormancy during hot summers.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilize it lightly in spring and prune spent flower heads to encourage reblooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
