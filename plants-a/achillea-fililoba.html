                <h1>Achillea fililoba</h1>
<p>Achillea fililoba, commonly known as slender yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea fililoba is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fililoba has narrow, linear leaves that are typically bluish-gray in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, and it grows in a compact, upright pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat, circular heads, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fililoba is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with populations found in isolated areas of these regions. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and steppe environments, often growing in well-drained soils. This species is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Achillea fililoba is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fililoba is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late winter. The growth cycle of Achillea fililoba involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its form and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like rosemary or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea fililoba is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
