                <h1>Achyronia orbiculata</h1>
<p>Achyronia orbiculata, commonly known as the orbiculate milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among the milkweed genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia orbiculata has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered, and yellowish-green, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia orbiculata is primarily native to the southern United States, including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and sandy soils. This plant thrives in regions with warm climates and low rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed areas and can be found in both natural and anthropogenic environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southwestern United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia orbiculata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along railway tracks. Its ability to establish quickly makes it a successful invasive species in these regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically considered a major ecological threat in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
