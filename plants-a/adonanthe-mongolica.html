                <h1>Adonanthe mongolica</h1>
<p>Adonanthe mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Adonanthe mongolica is often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe mongolica has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe mongolica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and China.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly seen in high-altitude grasslands and steppes. It is also occasionally found in northern regions of Russia and the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many of its native ranges.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe mongolica was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of East Asia, including China, Mongolia, and parts of Russia, where it has adapted to the local environmental conditions. This plant prefers full sun exposure and is often found in areas with low humidity. Its distribution has been influenced by both natural dispersal and human activities, including horticultural interest.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and adaptability, it has become established in some regions beyond its native range.</p>
