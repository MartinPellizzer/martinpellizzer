<p>Atriplex hastifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable species for stabilizing soils in saline or degraded areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex hastifolia is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for its purported health benefits.</p>
