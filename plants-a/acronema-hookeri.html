                <h1>Acronema hookeri</h1>
<p>Acronema hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's acronema, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinct, often aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Acronema hookeri is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema hookeri has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 2â€“5 cm long and arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often branched, with a smooth, light green bark that remains thin throughout its growth. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure that relies on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema hookeri is primarily native to Assam, China South-Central, East Himalaya, Nepal, and Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forested landscapes. The species is well-adapted to the cool and humid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema hookeri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in both natural and urban environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is currently considered a minor invasive species in the area.</p>
