                    <h1>Arabis lactea</h1>
<p>Arabis lactea, commonly known as the milky rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Arabis lactea is often found in alpine meadows and is an important part of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
