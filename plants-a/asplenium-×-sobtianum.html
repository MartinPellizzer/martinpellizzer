                    <h1>Asplenium × sobtianum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × sobtianum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
