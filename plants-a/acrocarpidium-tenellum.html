                    <h1>Acrocarpidium tenellum</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium tenellum, commonly known as the slender moss, is a small, leafy moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a prostrate growth habit with closely spaced, narrow leaves that are often curved at the tips. The plant produces spore capsules that are borne on short, erect stalks, typical of many mosses. It is often found in forest floors or on rocks, where it contributes to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and can serve as an indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
