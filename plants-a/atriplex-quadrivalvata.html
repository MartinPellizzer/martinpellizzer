<p>Atriplex quadrivalvata, commonly known as Four-Valved Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable species for stabilizing soils in saline areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex quadrivalvata plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and preventing erosion.</p>
