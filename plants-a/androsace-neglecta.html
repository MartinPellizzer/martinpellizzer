<p>Androsace neglecta, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Androsace neglecta is often found in alpine meadows and is an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
