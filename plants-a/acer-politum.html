                <h1>Acer politum</h1>
<p>Acer politum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-9 lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer politum has smooth, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbroken as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind due to their lack of showy petals. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over a wide area.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, helping to anchor the tree in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
