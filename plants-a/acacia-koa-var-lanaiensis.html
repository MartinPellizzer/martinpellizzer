<p>Acacia koa var. lanaiensis, commonly known as Lanai acacia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, often twisted branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in rounded inflorescences, followed by flat, elliptical pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
