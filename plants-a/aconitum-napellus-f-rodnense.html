                    <h1>Aconitum napellus f. rodnense</h1>
<p>Aconitum napellus f. rodnense, commonly known as the Rodnenskaya monkshood, is a botanical variant of the European monkshood.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant is native to the Carpathian region and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>However, like other members of the genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.</p>
