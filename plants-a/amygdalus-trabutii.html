                    <h1>Amygdalus trabutii</h1>
<p>Amygdalus trabutii, commonly known as the Trabut's almond, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountains of Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, hard-shelled nuts similar to almonds, though they are not typically edible. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
