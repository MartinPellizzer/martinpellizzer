<p>Arabis sabulosa var. frigida, commonly known as the sandstone rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions.</p>
