                    <h1>Adelodypsis gracilis</h1>
<p>Adelodypsis gracilis, commonly known as the slender ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Adelodypsis gracilis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
