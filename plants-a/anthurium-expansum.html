                    <h1>Anthurium expansum</h1>
<p>Anthurium expansum, commonly known as the giant anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant produces vibrant, spatulate-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which are actually modified leaves called spathes. Anthurium expansum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and colorful inflorescences make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes.</p>
