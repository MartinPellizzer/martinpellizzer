                    <h1>Apium prostratum var. maritimum</h1>
<p>Apium prostratum var. maritimum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it tolerates high salinity and strong winds. The plant has prostrate growth habits, with branching stems that often lie close to the ground. Its small, green leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
