                <h1>Acourtia bravohollisiana</h1>
<p>Acourtia bravohollisiana, commonly known as the San Benito sage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and showy purple-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia bravohollisiana has leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and covered with fine, hairy texture, while the bark is smooth and pale green in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia bravohollisiana is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern part of Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia bravohollisiana was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that mimic its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is typically found in regions with well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. This plant has been introduced to several locations in the western United States, including California and Oregon. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread and impact on local ecosystems.</p>
