                    <h1>Alopecurus alpinus var. altaicus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus alpinus var. altaicus, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous areas.</p>
