                <h1>Achillea oxyloba</h1>
<p>Achillea oxyloba, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Achillea oxyloba is known for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green, and slightly hairy, with a rough texture and a silver-blue underside, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba is primarily native to Austria, Italy, Romania, and Ukraine.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in alpine and subalpine regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and dry habitats, often growing on slopes and meadows. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas, reflecting its adaptation to particular environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its characteristic yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and open woods. This plant has become naturalized in several regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands.</p>
