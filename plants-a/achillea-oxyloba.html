                <h1>Achillea oxyloba</h1>
<p>Achillea oxyloba, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Achillea oxyloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are compound, consisting of a central yellow disc surrounded by ray florets in white or pale yellow, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Austria, Switzerland, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, mainly in alpine areas. It thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils, often found on rocky slopes and open meadows. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea oxyloba is classified as endangered in several regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba is a hardy perennial known for its attractive, flat-topped yellow flowers and fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its showy yellow flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea oxyloba contributes to biodiversity by supporting a variety of ecological interactions in its native habitat.</p>
