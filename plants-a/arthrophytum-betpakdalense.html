                    <h1>Arthrophytum betpakdalense</h1>
<p>Arthrophytum betpakdalense, commonly known as the Betpakdal cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, rounded shape that helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
