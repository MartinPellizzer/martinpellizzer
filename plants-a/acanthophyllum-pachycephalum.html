                        <h1>Acanthophyllum pachycephalum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum pachycephalum, commonly known as the thick-headed spiny bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant has small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum pachycephalum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
