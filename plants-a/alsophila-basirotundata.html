                    <h1>Alsophila basirotundata</h1>
<p>Alsophila basirotundata, commonly known as the broad-shouldered tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive trunk that is covered in a rough, fibrous layer, which provides structural support. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
