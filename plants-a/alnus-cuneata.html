                    <h1>Alnus cuneata</h1>
<p>Alnus cuneata, commonly known as the Sitka alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, and it is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same plant. Alnus cuneata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, stream banks, and moist forests.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
