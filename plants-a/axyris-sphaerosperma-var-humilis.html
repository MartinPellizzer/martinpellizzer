The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically yellow or green, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with deep roots that help it survive drought.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
