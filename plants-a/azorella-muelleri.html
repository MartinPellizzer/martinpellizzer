                    <h1>Azorella muelleri</h1>
<p>Azorella muelleri, commonly known as the Andean moss cushion, is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments, often found in the Andes Mountains at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Azorella muelleri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine flora and fauna.</p>
