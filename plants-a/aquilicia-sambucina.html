<p>Aquilicia sambucina, commonly known as the black elderberry, is a shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>The berries are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications, though they must be ripe and fully mature to avoid toxicity.</p>
