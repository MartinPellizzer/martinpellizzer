<p>Aridaria noctiflora subsp.</p>
<p>defoliata, commonly known as the night-blooming desert bell, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, leathery leaves that reduce water loss and are often shed during periods of extreme drought.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
