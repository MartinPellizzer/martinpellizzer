                    <h1>Asplenium kinabaluense</h1>
<p>Asplenium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu spleenwort, is a rare fern endemic to the high elevations of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>
