                    <h1>Arachnorchis huegelii</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis huegelii, commonly known as the Hugel's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble delicate webbing. The plant typically grows on the forest floor, often in shaded, humid environments, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually a mix of white and pale green, with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Arachnorchis huegelii is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
