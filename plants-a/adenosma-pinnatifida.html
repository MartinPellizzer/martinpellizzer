                <h1>Adenosma pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Adenosma pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, pinnately compound leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma pinnatifida is often found in regions like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma pinnatifida has leaves that are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a pale green to slightly grayish upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, hairy texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma pinnatifida is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant typically grows in forest understories or along riverbanks, where it benefits from high humidity and partial sunlight. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with humid evergreen and semi-evergreen forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma pinnatifida was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in coastal areas. It is considered a weed in some parts of its introduced range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches but has spread beyond its original introduction sites.</p>
