                <h1>Adisca albicans</h1>
<p>Adisca albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adisca albicans has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a waxy white underside, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody with a light green to brownish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adisca albicans is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape Province, particularly in areas with moist, sandy soils. This plant thrives in coastal regions and is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation. It is often seen growing near the coastlines of the southern part of the country.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adisca albicans was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in coastal areas. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along the shores of the North Island.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
