<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This variant is adapted to humid climates and is often seen in coastal areas and riverine habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southeastern region due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gracilis var. fruticulosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in several coastal areas. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
