                    <h1>Ammophila arundinacea</h1>
<p>Ammophila arundinacea, commonly known as beach grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that stabilizes sandy soils and prevents erosion. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, followed by feathery seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments makes it an important species for dune stabilization and habitat creation.</p>
