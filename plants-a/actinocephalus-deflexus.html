                <h1>Actinocephalus deflexus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus deflexus, commonly known as the twisted actinocephalus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus deflexus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to pale yellowish bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<p>It is found in the Western Cape Province, particularly in the fynbos biome. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within its native range due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus deflexus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. However, it is not considered a major invasive species.</p>
