                    <h1>Acacia eburnea</h1>
<p>Acacia eburnea, commonly known as the sand acacia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The wood of Acacia eburnea is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
