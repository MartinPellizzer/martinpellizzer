                    <h1>Asplundia sparrei</h1>
<p>Asplundia sparrei, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, velvety pink petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollinator trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant aroma that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asplundia sparrei is considered a conservation concern.</p>
