                        <h1>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus f. angustifoliatus</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus f. angustifoliatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf five-angled aralia, is a variant of the Chinese five-angled aralia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by dark blue berries. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in both traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus f. angustifoliatus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The plant is often associated with secondary growth and mixed deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of its preferred habitat conditions in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus f. angustifoliatus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along streambanks, where its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its compound leaves and clusters of small white flowers. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for horticultural and ecological purposes.</p>
