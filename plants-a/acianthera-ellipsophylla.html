                <h1>Acianthera ellipsophylla</h1>
<p>Acianthera ellipsophylla, commonly known as the elliptic-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Acianthera ellipsophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera ellipsophylla has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, with a complex structure featuring three petals and three sepals, and they are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the spring and attracting insect pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera ellipsophylla is primarily native to Costa Rica and Panamá.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of these Central American countries. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the cloud forests. The plant is well adapted to the moist and warm climate of these areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats in Costa Rica and Panamá.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera ellipsophylla was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses for its ornamental value. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes rather than for ecological or agricultural use.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on native ecosystems.</p>
