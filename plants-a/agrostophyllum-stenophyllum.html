<p>Agrostophyllum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed agrostophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under the canopy of tropical forests. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature.</p>
<p>Agrostophyllum stenophyllum plays a minor but ecologically important role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
