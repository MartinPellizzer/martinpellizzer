<p>Adiantopsis reesii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a unique, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant has a compact growth habit, with small, overlapping leaves that form a dense rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Adiantopsis reesii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
