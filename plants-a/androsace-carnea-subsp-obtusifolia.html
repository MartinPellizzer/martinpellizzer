<p>Androsace carnea subsp.</p>
<p>obtusifolia, commonly known as the pink rockrose, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are generally rounded and densely packed, forming a dense, cushion-like structure that helps insulate the plant in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
