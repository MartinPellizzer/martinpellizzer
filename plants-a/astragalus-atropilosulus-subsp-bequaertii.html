<p>Astragalus atropilosulus subsp.</p>
<p>bequaertii, commonly known as the dark-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces small, yellow to pale green flowers in late spring. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
