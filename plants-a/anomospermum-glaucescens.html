                    <h1>Anomospermum glaucescens</h1>
<p>Anomospermum glaucescens, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
