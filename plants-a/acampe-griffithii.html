                        <h1>Acampe griffithii</h1>
<p>Acampe griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's acampe, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe griffithii is primarily native to the island of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is found in the wet zone of the country, particularly in the central and southern regions. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe griffithii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as land clearing and urbanization.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common invader in disturbed landscapes. The plant's rapid growth and ability to produce large quantities of seeds contribute to its invasive potential. It is particularly problematic in regions where it outcompetes native vegetation for resources.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to various parts of the world, including parts of Australia and the United States.</p>
