                <h1>Acampe griffithii</h1>
<p>Acampe griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's acampe, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acampe griffithii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe griffithii is a flowering plant native to the island of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in the southern and western parts of the island, where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forests and is often found in areas with high biodiversity. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acampe griffithii is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acampe griffithii is a rare and ornamental plant known for its striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, making it suitable for long-term cultivation.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with a balanced liquid fertilizer applied during the growing season, while pruning is necessary to maintain shape and encourage new growth. Common pests include spider mites and aphids, while diseases like root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like sedums or succulents can enhance its growth environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acampe griffithii is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other flora in the surrounding area. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acampe griffithii contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its environment.</p>
