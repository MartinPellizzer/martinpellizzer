                <h1>Achyronia microdon</h1>
<p>Achyronia microdon, commonly known as the small green orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, underground rhizome.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achyronia microdon is considered a threatened species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia microdon has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, bark-like texture, with a reddish-brown color. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia microdon is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with areas of high groundwater activity. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a characteristic plant of the region's aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia microdon was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It was originally from South America, specifically Brazil. The plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a concern for local ecosystems.</p>
