                    <h1>Andryala lyrata var. minor</h1>
<p>Andryala lyrata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser lyreleaf, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lyre-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
