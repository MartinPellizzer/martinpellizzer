                    <h1>Anthericum andongense var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Anthericum andongense var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth anthericum, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that produce pale green to white flowers. The plant exhibits a glabrous (hairless) surface, which is a notable feature distinguishing it from other varieties of Anthericum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
