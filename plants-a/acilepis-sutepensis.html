                <h1>Acilepis sutepensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis sutepensis, commonly known as the Andean hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru and northern Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis sutepensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky soils and facilitating nutrient uptake.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis sutepensis is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of the country, particularly in the mountainous areas of Chiang Mai and northern provinces. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often found in forested areas and near streams.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Thailand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis sutepensis was mainly introduced to the Andean highlands of Peru and northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, arid environments at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters. This plant is adapted to extreme conditions, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is restricted due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
