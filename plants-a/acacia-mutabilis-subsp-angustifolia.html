                        <h1>Acacia mutabilis subsp. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often grayish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of chlorophyll and the ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their complex vascular systems.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by a wide variety of flower structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants with a distinctive arrangement of leaves and flowers, including legumes and vetches. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive acorn-like seed pods and often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia mutabilis, a specific type of acacia that is further divided into subspecies, with angustifolia being a subspecies distinguished by its narrow leaves and specific geographic distribution.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia is primarily native to South Australia and Western Australia. This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the southern and western parts of Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and ecological restoration projects due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in degraded areas. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, it remains a popular choice for both aesthetic and functional purposes in certain landscapes.</p>
