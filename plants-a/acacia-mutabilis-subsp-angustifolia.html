                <h1>Acacia mutabilis subsp. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features slender, angular stems with small, feathery leaves that are typically narrow and green.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface. The stem is slender, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and form globular clusters, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a legume pod that contains small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water and nutrients from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. Its current distribution includes parts of the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal scrub and chaparral environments, often near the shoreline. This species is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as a species of concern in some areas, though its conservation status is generally considered stable overall.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia is a drought-tolerant shrub known for its bright yellow flowers and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Fertilization should be minimal, with a balanced fertilizer applied in spring, while pruning is best done after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in humid conditions, and it pairs well with native grasses and drought-tolerant flowering plants in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. It also serves as a companion plant in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it an important component of native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia is a versatile plant with various uses and applications. In culinary contexts, its young shoots and leaves can be consumed as a vegetable, adding a unique flavor to local dishes.</p>
