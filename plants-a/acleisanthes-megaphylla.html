                <h1>Acleisanthes megaphylla</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes megaphylla, commonly known as the giant leaf datura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. The plant produces egg-shaped, greenish-brown fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Acleisanthes megaphylla is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes megaphylla has leaves that are broad and ovate, with a smooth, waxy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, typically displaying a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and slightly hairy, with a greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, and it grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are showy, with large, funnel-shaped petals in shades of yellow and orange, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes megaphylla is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as in parts of Baja California. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky slopes and sandy soils. It is commonly associated with desert ecosystems and thrives in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes megaphylla was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and urban environments. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded significantly since its introduction, posing challenges for ecological management.</p>
