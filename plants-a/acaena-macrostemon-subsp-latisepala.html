<p>latisepala is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of Canterbury and Otago.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with subalpine and alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the native vegetation in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena macrostemon subsp.</p>
<p>latisepala was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in grasslands and forest margins.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local biodiversity.</p>
