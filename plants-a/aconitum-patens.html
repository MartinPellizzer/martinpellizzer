                <h1>Aconitum patens</h1>
<p>Aconitum patens, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces showy, hood-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum patens has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are usually ovate to cordate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they can grow up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are blue to purple, clustered in racemes, and have a spurred shape, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum patens is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including countries such as Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or moist, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in meadows, woodlands, and along streams at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is part of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for cooler climates, it is less common in lower elevation areas and is considered a rare species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum patens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and upright growth habit. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
