                        <h1>Acacia costaricensis</h1>
<p>Acacia costaricensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is typically found in dry to semi-deciduous forests and is adapted to tropical climates.</p>
<p>Acacia costaricensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia costaricensis is primarily native to Central America, specifically found in countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Nicaragua.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dry forests and along riverbanks. This species is commonly found in lowland areas with well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally cultivated in other parts of the tropics.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia costaricensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned pastures, and secondary forests. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several areas, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and reforestation efforts.</p>
