<p>Acalypha vagans var. genuina, commonly known as the silver flame plant, is a striking ornamental shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow, which are modified leaves that serve as attractants for pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy green leaves with a waxy coating, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its bold, eye-catching foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha vagans var. genuina has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a vibrant green color that may turn reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly hairy surface, and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. It produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically in shades of pink or white, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha vagans var. genuina is a variant of the species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes below 1,000 meters, where it benefits from consistent temperatures and high humidity.</p>
<p>Currently, it is not considered endangered, but its introduction to new areas may pose ecological concerns due to its potential for invasive growth.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
