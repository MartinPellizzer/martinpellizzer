<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
