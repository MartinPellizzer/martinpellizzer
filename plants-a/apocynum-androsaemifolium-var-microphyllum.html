                    <h1>Apocynum androsaemifolium var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Apocynum androsaemifolium var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, followed by follicles that contain toxic, orange-red seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
