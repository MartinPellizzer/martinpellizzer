<p>Androsace dasyphylla, commonly known as the Alpine snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
