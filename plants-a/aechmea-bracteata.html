                <h1>Aechmea bracteata</h1>
<p>Aechmea bracteata, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from pink to red, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and gas exchange.</p>
<p>Aechmea bracteata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea bracteata has strap-shaped, spirally arranged leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem covered in a dense, fibrous bark that is dark brown in color. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, usually in shades of red or orange, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that disperses seeds through both animal and wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or acidic soils.</p>
