                            <h1>Armeria Splendens</h1>
<p>Armeria splendens is a striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. Known for its vibrant, showy blooms, it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun. This plant is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats, where it plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and development, Armeria splendens is now considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
