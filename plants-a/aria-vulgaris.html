                    <h1>Aria vulgaris</h1>
<p>Aria vulgaris, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
