                <h1>Arthrosolen deserticola</h1>
<p>Arthrosolen deserticola, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Arthrosolen deserticola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert insects and small animals.</p>
