<p>Alnus incana f. pinnata, commonly known as the silky alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, pinnately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands.
