                    <h1>Agropyron cristatum var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Agropyron cristatum var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
