                    <h1>Acanthospora</h1>
<p>Acanthospora, commonly known as the spiny bladderwrack, is a genus of brown algae belonging to the family Dictyotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery thallus with spiny projections, which provide structural support and aid in water retention. The plant typically grows in marine environments, particularly in rocky substrates along coastal regions. Acanthospora species are often found in temperate and polar waters, where they play a role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, including both sexual and asexual spores, contribute to their widespread distribution and ecological significance.</p>
