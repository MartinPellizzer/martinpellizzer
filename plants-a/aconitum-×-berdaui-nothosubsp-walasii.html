                <h1>Aconitum × berdaui nothosubsp. walasii</h1>
<p>Aconitum × berdaui nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii, commonly known as the Walasii monkshood, is a hybrid plant in the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that are typically 5-7 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The plant produces a spiny, branched stem and has palmately lobed leaves with a rough texture. Native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × berdaui nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic, with a wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 10–15 cm in length, displaying a dark green color with a silvery underside. The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern.</p>
<p>Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spike-like inflorescences, each having five petal-like sepals and a spurred nectary, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × berdaui nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in parts of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Its current distribution is primarily limited to its native range, with limited cultivation in botanical gardens and horticultural collections.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though its exact status is not well documented.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × berdaui nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii is a striking perennial plant known for its vibrant blue to purple flowers and dramatic foliage. It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers and seeds in its second year before dying back. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its ornamental appeal and create a lush, shaded garden environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum × berdaui nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii is a plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its flowers and foliage for sustenance.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for various invertebrates and microorganisms in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum × berdaui nothosubsp.</p>
