<p>Arthrocereus rondonianus, commonly known as the Rondonian night bloomer, is a cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
