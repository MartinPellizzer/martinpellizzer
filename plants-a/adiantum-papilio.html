                <h1>Adiantum papilio</h1>
<p>Adiantum papilio, commonly known as the flying mouse fern, is a delicate, fern-like plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a light, airy appearance. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and have a glossy surface, with a unique, almost translucent quality. Adiantum papilio thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shady garden landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum papilio has feather-like, pinnate leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, bright green color and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright with a smooth, pale green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sorus, and it does not produce true flowers in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>The plant disperses its spores via wind, and its roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring it to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum papilio is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This fern is found in the tropical regions of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with forest understories and rocky outcrops. The plant's distribution is largely restricted to specific habitats within Madagascar.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum papilio was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport in horticultural trade or as a contaminant in soil or plant material. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has spread rapidly in native forests and along stream margins. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species have led to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further colonization of natural habitats.</p>
