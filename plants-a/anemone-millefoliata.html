                    <h1>Anemone millefoliata</h1>
<p>Anemone millefoliata, commonly known as the common anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of large, lobed, fern-like leaves, which give it its scientific name "millefoliata," meaning "thousand leaves.". The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a central cluster of yellow stamens, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Anemone millefoliata is also valued for its ability to naturalize and provide early season floral interest in the garden.</p>
