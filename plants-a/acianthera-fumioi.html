                <h1>Acianthera fumioi</h1>
<p>Acianthera fumioi, commonly known as the smoky orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to regions of South America.</p>
<p>It produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color, resembling smoky or ash-like hues. The plant has a short, compact stem with a single or few leaves, and its roots are adapted for attachment to trees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera fumioi has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, featuring white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera fumioi is primarily native to Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean region of the country, particularly in the departments of La Paz and Santa Cruz. This orchid typically grows in humid, montane forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. It thrives in shaded understory environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Bolivia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera fumioi was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed areas, including roadsides and urban environments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded conditions, making it adaptable to a variety of ecological niches. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
