                    <h1>Anthistiria vulcanica</h1>
<p>Anthistiria vulcanica, commonly known as the firebloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, volcanic soil and is adapted to high-altitude environments with extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and moths. Its unique morphology includes thick, waxy leaves that help conserve moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anthistiria vulcanica is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
