                <h1>Adelia celastrinea</h1>
<p>Adelia celastrinea, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adelia celastrinea is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia celastrinea has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light grey bark that peels in thin, flaky layers as the plant matures. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia celastrinea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia celastrinea was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, particularly in woodland edges and disturbed sites. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in partial shade have contributed to its establishment in new regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, Adelia celastrinea is now considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
