                <h1>Adenorachis atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Adenorachis atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered rockcress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs.</p>
<p>Adenorachis atropurpurea is often found in alpine or arctic regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenorachis atropurpurea has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a purple-tinged underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, with pale purple petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorachis atropurpurea is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky soils and is commonly found in mountainous and coastal areas. This plant is particularly associated with the Iberian Peninsula, southern France, and the Balearic Islands. It prefers sunny, well-drained habitats and is often seen growing on cliffs or in scrublands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the climate of the Mediterranean basin, where it has adapted to the dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorachis atropurpurea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive purple flowers. Despite its beauty, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can form dense stands in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
