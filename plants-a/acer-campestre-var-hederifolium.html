                    <h1>Acer campestre var. hederifolium</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. hederifolium, commonly known as the creeping maple, is a compact shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often larger and more pronounced than those of the typical maple. The plant produces small, red or orange-red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ability to form dense ground cover and its tolerance to urban environments.</p>
