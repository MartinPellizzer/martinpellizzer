<p>Ambulia hottonioides, commonly known as the Hinton's ambulia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats of foliage near the ground.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ambulia hottonioides is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
