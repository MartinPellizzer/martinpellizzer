                <h1>Actephila ovalis</h1>
<p>Actephila ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaf actephila, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila ovalis has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila ovalis is primarily native to Malaya and Thailand.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant is well-adapted to the warm and moist climate of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to the specific ecological conditions found in Malaya and Thailand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila ovalis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in sunny, open areas. This plant has shown rapid colonization ability, spreading to areas with suitable soil and climate conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
