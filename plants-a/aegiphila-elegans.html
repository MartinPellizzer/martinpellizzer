                <h1>Aegiphila elegans</h1>
<p>Aegiphila elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf germander, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, reducing water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Aegiphila elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila elegans has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native habitat.</p>
