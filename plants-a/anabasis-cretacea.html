                    <h1>Anabasis cretacea</h1>
<p>Anabasis cretacea, commonly known as the cretaceous saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Anabasis cretacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
