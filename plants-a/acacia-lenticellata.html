                    <h1>Acacia lenticellata</h1>
<p>Acacia lenticellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are encased in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
<p>Acacia lenticellata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.</p>
