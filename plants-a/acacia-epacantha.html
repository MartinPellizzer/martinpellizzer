                        <h1>Acacia epacantha</h1>
<p>Acacia epacantha, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which are followed by woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acacia epacantha is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
