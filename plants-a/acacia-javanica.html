                        <h1>Acacia javanica</h1>
<p>Acacia javanica, commonly known as the Javan acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense inflorescences, and is known for its ability to thrive in dry and arid conditions. Acacia javanica is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and forage.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia javanica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests, coastal areas, and disturbed sites. This species is commonly associated with sandy or loamy soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia javanica is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia javanica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in land rehabilitation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Africa where it has been planted for erosion control and as a source of timber. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its invasive potential in some ecosystems. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environments.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from outcompeting native species.</p>
