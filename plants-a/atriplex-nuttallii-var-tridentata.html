                    <h1>Atriplex nuttallii var. tridentata</h1>
<p>Atriplex nuttallii var. tridentata, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Shadscale is well adapted to harsh conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
