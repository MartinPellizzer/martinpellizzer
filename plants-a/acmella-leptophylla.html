                <h1>Acmella leptophylla</h1>
<p>Acmella leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in wet, tropical environments and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous and are surrounded by brightly colored leaves that serve as attractants for pollinators.</p>
<p>Acmella leptophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella leptophylla has narrow, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white, and consist of five petals arranged in a radial pattern, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella leptophylla is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the wetland and marshy areas of these regions. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and abundant water. Its native distribution spans across parts of South America, particularly in the eastern and central regions.</p>
<p>It is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella leptophylla was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant has been reported in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its introduction is often associated with human activities like land modification and water management.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited data on its spread and interactions with native species.</p>
