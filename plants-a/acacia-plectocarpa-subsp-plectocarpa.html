<p>Acacia plectocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>plectocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the phyllodes. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that perform photosynthesis. Acacia plectocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>plectocarpa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
