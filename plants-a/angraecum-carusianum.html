                    <h1>Angraecum carusianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum carusianum, commonly known as the Carusian orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil. The plant produces striking, long-lasting white flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
