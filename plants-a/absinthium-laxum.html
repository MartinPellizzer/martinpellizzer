<p>Absinthium laxum is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium laxum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This plant is also present in parts of southern Russia and the Caucasus region. It is commonly found in meadows, slopes, and along riverbanks in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the cold, arid climates typical of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium laxum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was originally native to Europe and parts of Asia but has since spread to various regions. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks.
