<p>Adiantum capillus-veneris var. fissum, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its distinctive fronds with a central vein.</p>
<p>It is a delicate, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, silky-textured leaves that give the plant a light, airy appearance. It produces small, clustered spore cases on the underside of its fronds, which are typically brown and covered in a fine, powdery coating.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its elegant, lace-like foliage.</p>
