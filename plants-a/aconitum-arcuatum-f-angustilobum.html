                    <h1>Aconitum arcuatum f. angustilobum</h1>
<p>Aconitum arcuatum f. angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately lobed, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.</p>
