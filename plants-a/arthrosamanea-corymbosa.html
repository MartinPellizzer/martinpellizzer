<p>Arthrosamanea corymbosa, commonly known as the tropical milk tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>

The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat.</p>
