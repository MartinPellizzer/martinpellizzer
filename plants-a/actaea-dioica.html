                <h1>Actaea dioica</h1>
<p>Actaea dioica, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, unbranched stems that bear large, compound leaves with pinnate divisions. The plant produces showy, white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its roots are the primary part used in herbal medicine, valued for their potential hormonal and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea dioica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with serrated edges and a palmate shape, typically measuring 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker and more fissured with age, growing upright and branching at the base. Its flowers are white and clustered in upright panicles, consisting of small, petal-less flowers with prominent stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate composed of many small achenes, which are dispersed by birds and through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, serving as storage organs and contributing to the plant's resilience.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea dioica is primarily native to temperate regions of Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Its distribution includes countries such as France, Germany, and the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is also present in parts of the Middle East and southern Russia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea dioica was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, including the eastern United States and parts of Canada. The plant spreads primarily through its berries, which are dispersed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species in certain ecosystems.</p>
