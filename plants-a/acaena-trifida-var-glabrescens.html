<p>Acaena trifida var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, oval to egg-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is noted for its smoother texture. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in heads, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often considered unpalatable.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
