                    <h1>Axonopus obtusifolius var. rolfsii</h1>
<p>Axonopus obtusifolius var. rolfsii, commonly known as Florida carpetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage with narrow, flat leaves that have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland areas, lawns, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>This variant is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent erosion but is also considered a weed in some landscapes.</p>
