                <h1>Aconitum pumilum</h1>
<p>Aconitum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pumilum has basal, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a short petiole.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in a raceme, and consist of five petals with a spurred upper petal; they bloom in late summer and are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pumilum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, and western China.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. This species is commonly found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges. It prefers well-drained soils and cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Aconitum pumilum is a perennial herb that plays a significant role in the biodiversity of these high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pumilum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental spread.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions with temperate climates. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native areas, sometimes competing with native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common sight in many garden settings outside its native range.</p>
