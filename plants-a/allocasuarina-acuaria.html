<p>Allocasuarina acuaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like phyllodes that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody, cone-like structures called glochids, which release them when ripe.</p>
<p>Allocasuarina acuaria is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
