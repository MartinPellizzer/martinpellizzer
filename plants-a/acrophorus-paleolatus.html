                <h1>Acrophorus paleolatus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus paleolatus, commonly known as the paleolatus acrophorus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acrophorus paleolatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus paleolatus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are elliptical in shape, dark green in color, and relatively small in size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slight rough texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus paleolatus is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and northern regions of the island, particularly in humid lowland and montane forests. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats within these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus paleolatus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the ecological restoration efforts in the 1970s. The plant was chosen for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded areas. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
