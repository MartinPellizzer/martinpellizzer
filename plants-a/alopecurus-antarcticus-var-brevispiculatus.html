<p>Alopecurus antarcticus var. brevispiculatus, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, dense tufts of hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its compact growth form and frost-resistant nature make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The variety brevispiculatus is distinguished by its shorter and more robust spikelets compared to other varieties of Alopecurus antarcticus.</p>
