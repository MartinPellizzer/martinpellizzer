                    <h1>Atraphaxis tournefortii</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis tournefortii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its woody stems and compact growth habit help it conserve water and resist wind damage.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis tournefortii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
