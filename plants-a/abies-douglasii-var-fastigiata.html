                        <h1>Abies douglasii var. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Abies douglasii var. fastigiata, commonly known as the stiff-branch fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are short, stiff, and arranged in compact clusters along the shoots. Its cones are typically upright and reddish-brown, maturing to a darker color.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in landscaping due to its unique shape and hardiness.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies douglasii var. fastigiata is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in the mountainous regions of California, Oregon, and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-elevation forests and alpine areas where the climate is cool and moist. This variety of Douglas fir thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with other coniferous species in mixed forests. Its limited distribution is due to its specific habitat requirements and elevation preferences.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these mountain ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies douglasii var. fastigiata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique, columnar growth habit and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>It is often used in gardens and urban environments where space is limited and a vertical form is desired. This variety is valued for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. However, it may pose a risk of becoming invasive in certain regions if not properly managed.</p>
<p>Its introduction has expanded its geographic range beyond its native habitat in the western United States.</p>
