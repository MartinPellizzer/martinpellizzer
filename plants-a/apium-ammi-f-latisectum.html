                    <h1>Apium ammi f. latisectum</h1>
<p>Apium ammi f. latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leafed parsley, is a variant of the common hogweed.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broadly lobed leaves that are often more pronounced than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions.</p>
