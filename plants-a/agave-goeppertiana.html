                    <h1>Agave goeppertiana</h1>
<p>Agave goeppertiana, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a striking plant native to the Sonoran Desert of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, spiny stems that can grow up to 20 feet tall, making it one of the tallest agave species. The plant produces large, white flowers in clusters at the top of its stem, which bloom only once in its lifetime. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in sharp spines, adapted for water storage and protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Agave goeppertiana is well-suited to arid environments and plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>
