<p>Angophora lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf angophora, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils.

<p>Angophora lanceolata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
