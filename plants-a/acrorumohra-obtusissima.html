                <h1>Acrorumohra obtusissima</h1>
<p>Acrorumohra obtusissima, commonly known as the blunt-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually unifoliate, with a distinct, rounded base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra obtusissima has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow with five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra obtusissima is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest canopies. This plant is commonly found in lowland and hillside areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its natural range has been significantly reduced in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra obtusissima was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in understory habitats. This plant is often found growing near the bases of trees or along the edges of streams. Its introduction has been noted in several countries, particularly in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
