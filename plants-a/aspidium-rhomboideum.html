<p>Aspidium rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhomboid water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, rhomboid-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Aspidium rhomboideum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
