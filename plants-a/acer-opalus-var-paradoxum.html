                    <h1>Acer opalus var. paradoxum</h1>
<p>Acer opalus var. paradoxum, commonly known as the Norway maple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a distinctive, symmetrical shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities in urban landscapes.</p>
