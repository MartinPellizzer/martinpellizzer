                <h1>Adenia coccinea</h1>
<p>Adenia coccinea, commonly known as the red belladonna or red adenium, is a striking shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, often woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenia coccinea is also known for its toxic properties, making it a plant to handle with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia coccinea has simple, ovate leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and clustered in panicles, featuring bright red petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by animals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots that anchor the plant deeply in the soil, providing stability and access to water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia coccinea is primarily native to the eastern and northern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. This plant thrives in rainforest, wetland, and coastal habitats. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Australian continent, with no natural presence elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia coccinea was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for both garden landscapes and naturalized settings. This plant is often cultivated for its attractive, showy flowers and is popular in horticultural trade across Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming naturalized in certain regions, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide.</p>
