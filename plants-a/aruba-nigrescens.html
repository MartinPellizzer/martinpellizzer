                    <h1>Aruba nigrescens</h1>
<p>Aruba nigrescens, commonly known as the black arum, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and dramatic, spadix-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Native to the Caribbean, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a glossy texture, while its flowers are clustered in a dense, often reddish or purple-colored spike. Aruba nigrescens is notable for its ability to produce a strong, musky scent, which attracts pollinators such as beetles and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
