                    <h1>Araiostegia imbricata</h1>
<p>Araiostegia imbricata, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, layered thallus structure, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. Its growth pattern is typically crust-like, adhering tightly to surfaces such as stone or soil.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions in its habitat.</p>
