<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has a spreading crown. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters, and it produces winged seeds in its fruit.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>forrestii has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, with a reddish-bronze coloration in the spring, turning bright red in autumn; the leaves are alternate in arrangement and typically measure between 5-10 cm in diameter. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in cymes, with greenish-yellow petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>forrestii is a rare maple species native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in countries like India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Its current distribution is limited to specific mountainous regions, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in cool, humid climates at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique plant in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>forrestii is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and elegant form. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. This species has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches is recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or leaf spot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>forrestii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem health.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports soil stability and offers ecological benefits through its seasonal leaf cover and habitat provision.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>forrestii is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages.</p>
