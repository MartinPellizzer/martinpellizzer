                <h1>Acalypha gummifera</h1>
<p>Acalypha gummifera, commonly known as the sticky-leaved spurge, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves that produce a sticky, milky sap, which is a defining botanical feature. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually greenish or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha gummifera has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a pale green to reddish-brown bark, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. It produces small, clustered flowers with five pink or red petals, blooming during the summer months, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gummifera is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical regions where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha gummifera is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases may occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha gummifera is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and promoting sustainable land use.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acalypha gummifera is a versatile plant with various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves are sometimes used in traditional dishes, particularly in certain regions of Southeast Asia.
