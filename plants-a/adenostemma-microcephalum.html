                <h1>Adenostemma microcephalum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and branched.</p>
<p>Adenostemma microcephalum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma microcephalum has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma microcephalum is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Mexico. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with areas that have a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenostemma microcephalum is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common component of chaparral ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma microcephalum was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along creek banks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecological balance.</p>
