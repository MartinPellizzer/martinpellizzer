                    <h1>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. cryptolepis</h1>
<p>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. cryptolepis, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky or shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. Its fronds are usually dark green and remain upright, with sporangia developing on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other members of the Asplenium genus, sharing similar reproductive and structural features.</p>
