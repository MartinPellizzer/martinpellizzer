                <h1>Adenia chevalieri</h1>
<p>Adenia chevalieri, commonly known as the African star gooseberry, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia chevalieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia chevalieri has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a somewhat woody structure. The flowers are large, showy, and borne in clusters, with a greenish-white color and a distinctive spurred shape; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia chevalieri is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and northern parts of the island. This plant grows in humid, tropical rainforest environments. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenia chevalieri is commonly found in secondary forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia chevalieri was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in partial shade to full sun conditions. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowers. It has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia as a horticultural species.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
