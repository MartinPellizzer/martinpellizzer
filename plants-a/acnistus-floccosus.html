                <h1>Acnistus floccosus</h1>
<p>Acnistus floccosus, commonly known as the woolly acnistus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus floccosus has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and vary in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and have a light green color, growing in a creeping or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale green, with five petals, and bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus floccosus is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions in southern Africa, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acnistus floccosus is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acnistus floccosus is a vigorous, sprawling shrub known for its soft, fuzzy foliage and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick establishment. The plant has an annual growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and shedding its leaves in the fall.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourages new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or herbs can improve soil fertility and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acnistus floccosus is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts birds and small mammals that feed on its seeds, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in some agricultural settings, helping to deter pests and improve soil health. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Acnistus floccosus offers ecological benefits by supporting a range of wildlife and enhancing the resilience of ecosystems.</p>
