                <h1>Acnistus floccosus</h1>
<p>Acnistus floccosus, commonly known as the woolly woodspurry, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Acnistus floccosus is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in coastal or inland areas with limited water availability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus floccosus has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus floccosus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, savannas, and disturbed habitats. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives ample sunlight. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus floccosus was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fluffy seed heads.</p>
<p>It has since become invasive in several regions, particularly in the southeastern states, where it outcompetes native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its seeds, which are easily dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it can alter habitat structure and reduce biodiversity in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Management efforts often focus on early detection and control to prevent further spread.</p>
