<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of the Caribbean and Central America. The plant is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, and its clusters of small, yellow-green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acalypha languida is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha languida has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is upright and somewhat branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a distinctive red or purple color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with the seeds being small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha languida is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, including parts of Africa and the Caribbean. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in lowland forests or along riverbanks. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Acalypha languida is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its conservation status may vary depending on local habitat preservation efforts.</p>
