<p>Arkezostis trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in sandy and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Arkezostis trilobata plays a role in stabilizing dune soils and providing habitat for small coastal organisms.</p>
