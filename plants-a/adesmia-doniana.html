                <h1>Adesmia doniana</h1>
<p>Adesmia doniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Adesmia doniana is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an invasive species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia doniana has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with a white to pale yellow color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia doniana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and is frequently encountered in agricultural areas. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing forage for livestock and supporting insect populations.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other parts of the world in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia doniana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with warm climates and low rainfall, making it common in tropical and subtropical zones. The plant is often found in areas where human activity has altered the natural landscape, facilitating its spread. Its adaptability to poor soil conditions allows it to colonize new environments quickly.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
