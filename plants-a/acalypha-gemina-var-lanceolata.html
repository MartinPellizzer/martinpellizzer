                        <h1>Acalypha gemina var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Acalypha gemina var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf copperleaf, is a strikingly ornamental shrub native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by distinctive red or orange seed capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its foliage rather than its flowers, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
