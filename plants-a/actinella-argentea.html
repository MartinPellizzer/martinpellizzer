                <h1>Actinella argentea</h1>
<p>Actinella argentea, commonly known as the silver actinella, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Actinella argentea is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella argentea has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a silvery-gray upper surface and a darker green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, light brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, bloom during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant to its substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella argentea is primarily native to the western Pacific, including regions such as Japan, the Philippines, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical environments, particularly in coastal areas and moist forests. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing on rocky or sandy substrates. It is an important component of the local flora in its native range, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings outside its natural distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella argentea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on disturbed soils. This plant is often associated with human activity and can thrive in urban environments. It has a rapid growth rate and can form dense stands.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed and can impact native plant communities.</p>
