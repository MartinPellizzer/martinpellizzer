                <h1>Acourtia huajuapana</h1>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana, commonly known as the Huajuapan daisy, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing its adaptability to arid conditions. Its yellow-orange petals and dark centers make it visually striking.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, typically in rocky or limestone soils. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands or scrublands. Acourtia huajuapana is a rare species with a limited geographic range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to specific ecological conditions found only in these regions of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and moist habitats, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is typically associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and agricultural fields. It has been reported in several counties along the Pacific coast, including Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in these regions.</p>
