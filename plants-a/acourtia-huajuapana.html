                <h1>Acourtia huajuapana</h1>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana, commonly known as the Huajuapan dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seed heads. It thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the rocky and well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, specifically in the state of Hidalgo.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within the Sierra Madre del Norte. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in open woodlands and grasslands. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,800 to 2,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acourtia huajuapana is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana is a rare and resilient plant native to Mexico, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and requiring a period of dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion planting with marigolds or lavender to deter insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acourtia huajuapana is a native plant that provides essential food and shelter for local wildlife, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. This plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in its vicinity. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acourtia huajuapana plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by offering habitat and resources to various ecological communities.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
