<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe papillosa is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone outcrops and sandy soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Acampe papillosa is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe papillosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
