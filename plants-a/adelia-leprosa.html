                <h1>Adelia leprosa</h1>
<p>Adelia leprosa, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, thick leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often forming a low, compact rosette. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white, and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Adelia leprosa thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia leprosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and enabling the plant to thrive in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia leprosa is primarily native to the arid regions of southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Western Australia and South Australia. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils within dry, open habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Adelia leprosa is often seen in areas with low rainfall and high sun exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia leprosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact.</p>
