                <h1>Aegialophila longispina</h1>
<p>Aegialophila longispina, commonly known as the long-spined sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, spiny leaves that provide protection against grazing. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky coastal soils.</p>
<p>Aegialophila longispina plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialophila longispina has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slight flaking texture as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
