                        <h1>Abrus wittei</h1>
<p>Abrus wittei, commonly known as the African snail bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and compound leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, inflated pods and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abrus wittei belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants with distinctive flowers and includes legumes. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Abrus, a group of flowering plants known for their ornamental value and some species containing toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Its species is Abrus wittei, a specific plant within the Abrus genus, noted for its unique morphology and potential ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus wittei is primarily native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of central Africa, particularly in the western and northern regions of the country. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus wittei was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. The plant spreads primarily through wind-dispersed seeds, which allows it to colonize disturbed areas quickly. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its invasive potential in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its unique seed pods and is used in traditional practices in certain regions.</p>
