                    <h1>Astragalus subtrijugus</h1>
<p>Astragalus subtrijugus, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Astragalus subtrijugus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
