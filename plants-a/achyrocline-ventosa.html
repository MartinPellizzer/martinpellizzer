                <h1>Achyrocline ventosa</h1>
<p>Achyrocline ventosa, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal or disturbed habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, oblong fruits called cypsela.</p>
<p>Achyrocline ventosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline ventosa has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually grayish-green in color and have a rough, hairy texture. The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline ventosa is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf and Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal and sandy habitats along the Gulf Coast. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dune ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline ventosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where there is ample sunlight and moderate to high humidity. This plant is commonly found in the Caribbean, parts of Central America, and southern Florida. Its introduction has often been associated with human activities like agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
