                <h1>Acokanthera longiflora</h1>
<p>Acokanthera longiflora, commonly known as the African arrow poison or leopard's bane, is a striking plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a deep red, containing toxic seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of acokantherin, a potent cardiac glycoside found in its leaves and roots.</p>
<p>This compound makes the plant highly toxic and historically used by indigenous communities for arrow poison.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera longiflora has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, spreading crown. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera longiflora is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry woodland, savanna, and rocky habitats. The plant is known for its toxic properties and is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high sunlight exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera longiflora was mainly introduced to regions in Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. The plant is known for its toxic properties and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a poison for hunting. Its introduction has been documented in ecological studies focusing on plant distribution and medicinal use.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements and toxicity.</p>
