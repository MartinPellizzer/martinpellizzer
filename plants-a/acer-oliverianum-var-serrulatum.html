                <h1>Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum</h1>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with finely serrated edges, which give it a distinctive appearance in the autumn. The tree produces small, red to orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and compact size make it ideal for smaller landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are serrated along the edges, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum is a rare and unique maple variety native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including botanical gardens and conservation centers in Europe and North America. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it experiences a temperate climate with distinct seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum is a slow-growing ornamental tree known for its striking red foliage and unique serrated leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree has a dormant growth cycle, with most growth occurring in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and birds.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. This plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its dense root system also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum is a lesser-known maple species with limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in some indigenous medicinal practices for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. While not widely utilized in industrial applications, its wood may have niche economic value in small-scale crafts. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely ecological and traditional, with further research needed to explore its full potential.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum has a limited number of recognized varieties, but it is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which exhibit striking yellow or variegated leaves. It has been hybridized with other maples, such as Acer japonicum, to create varieties with enhanced hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These hybrids are particularly valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in cooler climates and their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its role as a parent species in breeding programs aimed at developing more resilient and visually appealing maple cultivars.</p>
