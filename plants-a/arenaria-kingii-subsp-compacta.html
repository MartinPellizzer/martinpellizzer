<p>Arenaria kingii subsp.</p>
<p>compacta, commonly known as the compact sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal areas of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright green leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suited to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>
