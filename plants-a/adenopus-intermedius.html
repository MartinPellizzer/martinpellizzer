                <h1>Adenopus intermedius</h1>
<p>Adenopus intermedius, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is notable for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopus intermedius has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus intermedius is primarily native to the Gulf of Guinea Islands.</p>
<p>It is found in coastal regions of western Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon. This plant typically grows in moist, tropical habitats along the shoreline. It is commonly seen in mangrove forests and salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the Gulf of Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus intermedius was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
