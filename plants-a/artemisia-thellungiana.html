                    <h1>Artemisia thellungiana</h1>
<p>Artemisia thellungiana, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is not typically used in modern herbal medicine.</p>
