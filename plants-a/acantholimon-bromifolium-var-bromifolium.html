                        <h1>Acantholimon bromifolium var. bromifolium</h1>
<p>Acantholimon bromifolium var. bromifolium, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It is well adapted to salty and windy conditions, making it a characteristic species of coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dune soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon bromifolium var. bromifolium belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and diverse reproductive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive flower structures and often contains species adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, characterized by their often blue or violet flowers and specialized seed dispersal mechanisms. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, known for their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon bromifolium, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, characterized by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon bromifolium var. bromifolium is primarily native to Iran and Iraq.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. The species is well adapted to the dry and hot climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones in Iran and Iraq.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon bromifolium var. bromifolium was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to cold climates, particularly in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is typically found in areas with low precipitation and high solar exposure. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
