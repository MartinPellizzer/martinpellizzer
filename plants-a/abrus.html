                    <h1>Abrus</h1>
<p>Abrus, commonly known as the Indian satin flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The most well-known species, Abrus precatorius, is characterized by its striking red and white ornamental pods. The seeds of this plant contain a potent toxin called abrin, which makes them highly dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to their toxic properties, Abrus plants are often grown as ornamentals rather than for consumption.</p>
