<p>Avicennia marina subsp.</p>
<p>australasica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits salt-excreting glands on its leaves, allowing it to thrive in coastal areas with high salinity. It is typically found in intertidal zones, forming dense stands that contribute to coastal stabilization.</p>
<p>Its small, oblong leaves are usually arranged in whorls, and it produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects.</p>
