                <h1>Adinandra tomentosa</h1>
<p>Adinandra tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly adinandra, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a silvery-white underside. It produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by dark blue to black berries.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra tomentosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth when young but becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in racemose inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra tomentosa is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along forest floors or in understory layers. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Borneo, making it a regionally significant species.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the biodiversity of the island's ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra tomentosa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forest understories and along stream banks where it can thrive in humid environments. The plant prefers temperatures between 18°C and 25°C and requires consistent moisture levels. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
