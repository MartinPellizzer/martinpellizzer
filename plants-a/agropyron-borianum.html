<p>Agropyron borianum, commonly known as the Boreal wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Agropyron borianum is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor conditions.</p>
