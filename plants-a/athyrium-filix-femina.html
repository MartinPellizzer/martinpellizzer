                <h1>Athyrium filix-femina</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina, commonly known as the lady fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble a lady's fan, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
