<p>Aristida berlandieri, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of native plant communities.</p>
