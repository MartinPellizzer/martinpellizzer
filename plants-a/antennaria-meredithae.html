<p>Antennaria meredithae, commonly known as Meredith's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high alpine regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Antennaria meredithae plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
