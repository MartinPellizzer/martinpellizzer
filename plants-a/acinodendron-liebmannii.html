                <h1>Acinodendron liebmannii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron liebmannii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron liebmannii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with an upright growth habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron liebmannii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within East Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron liebmannii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It was introduced primarily for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a source of timber. The plant is also found in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros, where it has been cultivated for local use. Its introduction has led to its establishment in disturbed habitats and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
