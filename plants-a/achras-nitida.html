                <h1>Achras nitida</h1>
<p>Achras nitida, commonly known as the silver tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its silvery, powdery coating on its leaves and bark. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
<p>Achras nitida is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras nitida has simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are glossy green, with a waxy texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras nitida is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically the countries of South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen growing along the edges of rivers and in shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions due to its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras nitida was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, large, palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value. The plant is often used in residential and commercial gardens to add a tropical flair. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including parts of the United States and Australia.</p>
