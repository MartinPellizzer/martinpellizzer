                <h1>Achras nitida</h1>
<p>Achras nitida, commonly known as the white torch tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Achras nitida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras nitida has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green color and a waxy texture, typically measuring around 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and smooth, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright and branching sparingly. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a spiny capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras nitida is a shrub native to the dry tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Caribbean and the southern United States, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This species is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as threatened, its natural habitat is increasingly under pressure from land-use changes, leading to concerns about its long-term conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras nitida is a fast-growing, drought-tolerant shrub native to Africa, known for its striking silver-blue foliage and edible fruits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's desirable traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it ideal for quick landscape impact.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, especially once established. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or succulents can enhance its ornamental value and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras nitida is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting a wide range of fauna and improving habitat diversity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras nitida is a versatile plant with various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its fruit is edible and can be consumed fresh or processed into jams and juices. Medicinally, it has been used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as diarrhea and skin infections due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, its fibers are utilized in the production of ropes and textiles, contributing to local economies.</p>
