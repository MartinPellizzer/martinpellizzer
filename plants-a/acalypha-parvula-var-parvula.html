                        <h1>Acalypha parvula var. parvula</h1>
<p>Acalypha parvula var. parvula, commonly known as the smallleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest to its foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with finely serrated edges and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha parvula var. parvula belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and temperate species, often with distinctive floral structures. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with milky sap and a wide range of growth forms. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "copperleaf," characterized by their showy bracts and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha parvula, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its small size and distinctive floral features.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
