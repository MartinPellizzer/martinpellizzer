                    <h1>Amyema wenzelii</h1>
<p>Amyema wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus and myrtles, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in the humid, shaded environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Amyema wenzelii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing sustenance for wildlife.</p>
