                <h1>Adenia formosana</h1>
<p>Adenia formosana, commonly known as the Formosa adenium, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, often succulent stems that store water. Its leaves are usually palmate, with several lobes, and the flowers are large, with a distinctive crown of bracts.</p>
<p>Adenia formosana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia formosana has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are showy, with five pinkish-white petals and a prominent yellow stamen, blooming from May to July and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia formosana is primarily native to the eastern and central regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and mountainous areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant typically grows in dense forests and understorey habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>
<p>Adenia formosana is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia formosana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to these regions in the late 19th century by horticulturists and plant enthusiasts seeking to cultivate exotic species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in warm, moist environments and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island ecosystems.</p>
