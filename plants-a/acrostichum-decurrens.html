                <h1>Acrostichum decurrens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum decurrens, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to three meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum decurrens has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a bright green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat fibrous, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the late summer to early fall and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum decurrens is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in swampy or wetland environments along riverbanks and coastal areas. It is also present in some parts of the Caribbean and southern Florida.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with tropical rainforests and mangrove ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum decurrens was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands where it thrives in saline and brackish environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important species in coastal restoration projects. Its introduction has also led to its establishment in some inland wetlands due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in certain regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
