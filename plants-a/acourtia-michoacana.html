                <h1>Acourtia michoacana</h1>
<p>Acourtia michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan acourtia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia michoacana has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and has a fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia michoacana is a rare flowering plant native to the central region of Mexico, specifically the state of Michoac√°n.</p>
<p>It is currently found in limited areas within its native range, primarily in the Sierra de Ajusco and surrounding highlands. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acourtia michoacana is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acourtia michoacana is a flowering plant native to Mexico, known for its ornamental value and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a short growth cycle, blooming in early summer and completing its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acourtia michoacana is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various local wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for maintaining biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of surrounding flora. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acourtia michoacana contributes to soil stabilization and supports the overall health of its ecosystem.</p>
