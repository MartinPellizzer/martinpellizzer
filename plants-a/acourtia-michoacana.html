                <h1>Acourtia michoacana</h1>
<p>Acourtia michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan acourtia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico, specifically the state of Michoacan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia michoacana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, herbaceous, and have a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia michoacana is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Michoacán, Jalisco, Guanajuato, and parts of the Bajío region. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in dry to semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in areas with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to specific microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia michoacana was mainly introduced to specific regions of Mexico, particularly in the state of Michoacán, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and mild climates, often growing in association with other native plant species. This plant is typically distributed along the Pacific coast, especially in the southern part of the state, where it forms part of the local flora. Its introduction to these areas is largely due to its adaptation to the local ecological conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other plant species in the region.</p>
