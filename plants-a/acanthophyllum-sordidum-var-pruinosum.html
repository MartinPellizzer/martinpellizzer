                        <h1>Acanthophyllum sordidum var. pruinosum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum sordidum var. pruinosum, commonly known as the silverbrush saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, pruinosum (waxy) hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
