                    <h1>Apargia autumnalis var. alpina</h1>
<p>Apargia autumnalis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. It is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to access moisture in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to other varieties of Apargia.</p>
