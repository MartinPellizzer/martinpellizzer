<p>Abies apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo fir, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern. The cones of Abies apollinis are typically reddish-brown and release seeds in the autumn. This species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
