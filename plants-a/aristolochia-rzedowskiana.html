<p>Aristolochia rzedowskiana, commonly known as the Mexican birthwort, is a climbing vine native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for fruits due to their shape and size. Its roots and leaves contain aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been used in traditional medicine, though they are now known to be carcinogenic.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
