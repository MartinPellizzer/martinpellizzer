                    <h1>Asterocephalus columbaria var. degenerans</h1>
<p>Asterocephalus columbaria var. degenerans, commonly known as the degenerate starhead, is a rare and unusual plant species characterized by its distinctive, star-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in a radiating pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
