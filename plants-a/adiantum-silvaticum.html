                <h1>Adiantum silvaticum</h1>
<p>Adiantum silvaticum, commonly known as the woods fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum silvaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum silvaticum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a slender and upright growth habit, and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore case, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, with roots that are fibrous and well-developed for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum silvaticum is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments within these regions. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along stream banks and in understorey vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the subtropical and temperate rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum silvaticum was mainly introduced to shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and partial to full shade. This plant is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and consistent moisture. Its introduction has been noted in various regions where it has established itself as an invasive species.</p>
<p>Adiantum silvaticum spreads through spores, making it difficult to control once it becomes established.</p>
