<p>Atriplex cordulata var. cordulata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
