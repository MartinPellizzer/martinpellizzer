                            <h1>Afrosciadium Dispersum</h1>
<p>Afrosciadium dispersum is a rare and intriguing plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to theApiaceae family, known for its aromatic and often edible members. This species is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a conservation concern. Its study offers valuable insights into plant adaptation and biodiversity in mountainous ecosystems.</p>
