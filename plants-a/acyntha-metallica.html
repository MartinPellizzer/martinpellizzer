                <h1>Acyntha metallica</h1>
<p>Acyntha metallica, commonly known as the metallic acyntha, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha metallica has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody at the base, and has a rough, metallic sheen with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha metallica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and limestone habitats, often growing in open woodlands and alpine meadows. This plant thrives in areas with high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. Its distribution is closely linked to the Mediterranean climate, where it adapts to the dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>Acyntha metallica is also occasionally found in parts of North Africa, extending its native range slightly into the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha metallica was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
