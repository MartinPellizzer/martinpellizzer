The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are usually inconspicuous and produce light seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Aristida dissita is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
