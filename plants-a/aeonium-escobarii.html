<p>Aeonium escobarii, commonly known as the Escobarii Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Aeonium escobarii is also known for its slow growth and ability to form offsets, which can be propagated easily.</p>
