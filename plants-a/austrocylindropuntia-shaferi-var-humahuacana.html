<p>Austrocylindropuntia shaferi var. humahuacana, commonly known as the Huahua cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the highlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
