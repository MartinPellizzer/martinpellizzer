<p>Agropyron longiaristatum var. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, rough, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often slightly drooping, bearing small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to poor soils and is often found in steppe and desert scrub habitats.</p>
