<p>Acacia palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in lowland and mountainous areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
<p>Acacia palawanensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia palawanensis has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in pairs along the central axis, giving the leaves a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a smooth surface, and are alternate in arrangement along the stem. The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is light brown to grey in color, and it grows in a spreading or upright pattern depending on the environment. The flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in dense globular or cylindrical inflorescences, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, while the roots are deep and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia palawanensis is a species native to the Philippines, specifically found in Palawan and nearby islands.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated areas within its native range due to habitat fragmentation. It thrives in tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. Acacia palawanensis grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
