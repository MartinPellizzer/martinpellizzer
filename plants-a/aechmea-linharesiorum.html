<p>Aechmea linharesiorum, commonly known as the Linhares' pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea linharesiorum has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are clustered in a terminal inflorescence, with pinkish-red bracts and white to yellowish flowers that bloom during the summer months, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its natural habitat.</p>
