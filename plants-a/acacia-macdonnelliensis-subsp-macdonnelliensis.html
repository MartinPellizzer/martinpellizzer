                        <h1>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp. macdonnelliensis</h1>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly growth habit and phyllodes that are typically linear to narrowly elliptic.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which appear in spring and early summer. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and along coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and vascular systems.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have small, inconspicuous flowers and are often legumes. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of flowering plants commonly known as wattles, which are typically shrubs or trees with phyllodes.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia macdonnelliensis, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, distinguished by its unique morphological and genetic traits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded land in these regions.</p>
