                <h1>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp. macdonnelliensis</h1>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis, commonly known as the white-flowered acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and produces bright yellow flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>The leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, a common adaptation in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis has bipinnate leaves that are small, narrow, and arranged alternately along the stems, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or brown, and they exhibit a shrub-like growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and grouped into dense, spherical or cylindrical heads, blooming during the spring and summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis is a rare and specialized plant native to the southern regions of Western Australia. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within the Geraldton and Mid West regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils of open woodlands and coastal dunes, often in areas with a Mediterranean climate. This subspecies is typically found at elevations between 50 and 200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from land clearing and climate change, it is listed as critically endangered under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Australia, known for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil, and it requires minimal watering once established. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while being cautious of pests like aphids and diseases such as root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis is an important plant in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife. It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds with its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting other plant growth. Its dense foliage also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant, enhancing the biodiversity of the surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
