                    <h1>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp. macdonnelliensis</h1>
<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>macdonnelliensis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly growth habit and phyllodes that are typically linear to narrowly elliptic.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which appear in spring and early summer. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and along coastal dunes.</p>
