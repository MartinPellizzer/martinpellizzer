                        <h1>Abutilon cordatum</h1>
<p>Abutilon cordatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a woody stem and can grow as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its fuzzy, velvety leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Abutilon cordatum is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon cordatum is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the southeastern regions of the country, including the states of SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon cordatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century by European botanists and gardeners who sought to cultivate exotic species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its widespread establishment.</p>
