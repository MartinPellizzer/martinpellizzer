                <h1>Achillea sylvestris</h1>
<p>Achillea sylvestris, commonly known as field fleabane, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features upright, branched stems with narrow, gray-green leaves that are softly hairy. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite blooms that appear in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sylvestris has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped umbels, and bloom from late spring to early summer, being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sylvestris is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils. It is commonly seen in Mediterranean climates where it thrives in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into the Iberian Peninsula and the southern regions of France.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sylvestris was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and along the eastern seaboard. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its rapid spread has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain areas.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is still valued for its ecological benefits and low maintenance requirements.</p>
