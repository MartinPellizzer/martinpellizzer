                <h1>Acinodendron asclepiadeum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron asclepiadeum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron asclepiadeum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, dark green in color, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring five pinkish-white petals and a central yellowish corona, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron asclepiadeum is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often associated with shrubland and savanna ecosystems. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of eastern and southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron asclepiadeum was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in countries such as Australia, Papua New Guinea, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments. Its rapid growth and ability to establish quickly have led to its use in land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
