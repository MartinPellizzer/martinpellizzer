                    <h1>Asperula humifusa f. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Asperula humifusa f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous, or hairless, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
