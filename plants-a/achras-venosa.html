                <h1>Achras venosa</h1>
<p>Achras venosa, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that contains seeds used for propagation.</p>
<p>Achras venosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras venosa has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30â€“50 cm in diameter, with a deep green color and a slightly waxy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and short, with a smooth, dark brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces showy, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the dry season, which are pollinated by insects such as bees and beetles. The fruit is a large, spiky capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras venosa is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some regions of South America, particularly northern Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras venosa was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its unique, spiny leaves and attractive fruit.</p>
<p>It has been established in various parts of the world, including parts of the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native environments.</p>
