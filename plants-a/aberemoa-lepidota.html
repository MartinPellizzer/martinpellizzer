                        <h1>Aberemoa lepidota</h1>
<p>Aberemoa lepidota, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become an invasive species in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberemoa lepidota is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the coastal regions of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained habitats such as dunes and beachfront areas. It is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific coastal environments, making it a rare and unique native plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberemoa lepidota was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
