                    <h1>Anthenantia lanata var. genuina</h1>
<p>Anthenantia lanata var. genuina, commonly known as the woolly anthenantia, is a rare and distinctive plant characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This coating, composed of fine, soft hairs, helps protect the plant from excessive sunlight and moisture loss. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
