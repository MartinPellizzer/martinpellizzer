                            <h1>Ageratina Viscosa</h1>
<p>Whiteweed, scientifically known as Ageratina viscosa, is a common flowering plant found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. It is characterized by its fluffy white or pale blue flower heads that resemble small clouds, giving it its common name. This plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily in disturbed soils. Despite its invasive tendencies, Whiteweed has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its ecological impact varies, as it can both support pollinators and compete with native species for resources.</p>
