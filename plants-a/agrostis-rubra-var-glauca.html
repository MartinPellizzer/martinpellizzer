                    <h1>Agrostis rubra var. glauca</h1>
<p>Agrostis rubra var. glauca, commonly known as blue meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which makes it visually distinct from other grasses. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its compact growth and dense turf-forming ability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental use.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
