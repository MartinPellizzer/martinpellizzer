                <h1>Acnistus miersii</h1>
<p>Acnistus miersii, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, smooth berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus miersii has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, creeping, and often prostrate, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes woody with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, with a structure typical of the Malvaceae family, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to spread readily in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus miersii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of southern China and parts of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to regions with a warm, humid climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus miersii was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in disturbed soils and open areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via seed make it a potential invasive species in some regions. It is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in disturbed environments like roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
