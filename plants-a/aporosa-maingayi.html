                    <h1>Aporosa maingayi</h1>
<p>Aporosa maingayi, commonly known as the Bornean satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries. Aporosa maingayi is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
