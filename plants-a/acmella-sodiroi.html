                <h1>Acmella sodiroi</h1>
<p>Acmella sodiroi, commonly known as the yellow puffer or orange puffer, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella sodiroi has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that has a slight tendency to peel as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, with a unique structure featuring a single pistil and stamens that are often curled, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils in tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella sodiroi is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Amazon Basin and other neighboring countries in the region. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and rich, well-drained soils. This species is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella sodiroi is a tropical plant known for its vibrant orange flowers and unique medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acmella sodiroi includes a rapid growth phase during the warm season, followed by a dormant period in cooler months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella sodiroi is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds or use it for shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acmella sodiroi contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide array of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
