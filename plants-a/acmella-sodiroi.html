<p>Acmella sodiroi, commonly known as the golden triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescence. The plant features hairy, ovate leaves and produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Acmella sodiroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella sodiroi has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern.
