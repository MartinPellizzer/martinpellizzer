                <h1>Achillea incisa</h1>
<p>Achillea incisa, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads composed of numerous small white to pinkish flowers, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Achillea incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea incisa has narrow, serrated leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a grayish-green bark, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene, with a pappus that allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea incisa is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions of Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these Mediterranean countries, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Australia. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands. Achillea incisa typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although habitat loss due to land development and urbanization poses a potential threat to its populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea incisa is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in a well-draining seed-starting mix. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune spent flower stems to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>
