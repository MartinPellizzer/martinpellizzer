<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a greenish color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming from early summer to late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>
