                <h1>Achillea abrotanifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea abrotanifolia, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that typically range from white to pale yellow. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, herbaceous stems and is known for its medicinal properties historically used in traditional remedies.</p>
<p>Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a valuable addition to pollinator gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanifolia has basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, and vary in size from 2 to 8 cm in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown color, growing from the base and branching sparingly. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads with ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes parts of the Canary Islands and Madeira, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. This species typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils, often on slopes and cliffs. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea abrotanifolia is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanifolia is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in the fall. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within one growing season and producing flowers within a few months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of compost in the spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
