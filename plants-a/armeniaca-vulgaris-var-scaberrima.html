<p>Armeniaca vulgaris var. scaberrima, commonly known as the wild peach or bitter almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by fruits that are typically small, round, and have a bitter flavor. Its fruit contains a single hard pit and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its toxic properties, particularly due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in its seeds and leaves.</p>
