                    <h1>Anthyllis</h1>
<p>Anthyllis, commonly known as sweet clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern. Anthyllis species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates. They have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps improve soil fertility.</p>
<p>Some species are cultivated for forage, while others are considered invasive in certain regions.</p>
