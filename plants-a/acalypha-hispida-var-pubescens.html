                <h1>Acalypha hispida var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Acalypha hispida var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or rough hollyhock, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha hispida var. pubescens has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in short, stiff hairs, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamen clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hispida var. pubescens is a variant of the common velvetleaf, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in warm climates around the world, including parts of the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, agricultural fields, and riverbanks. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas and is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
