<p>Agrostis cognata, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets.</p>
<p>Agrostis cognata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures due to its fine texture and dense growth habit.</p>
