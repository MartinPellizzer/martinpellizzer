                <h1>Aechmea jenmanii</h1>
<p>Aechmea jenmanii, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spiky, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its flowering spikes, giving it an ornamental appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea jenmanii is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea jenmanii has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, sword-like, and arranged in a dense spiral, with a vibrant green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, fibrous base that supports the rosette structure. Its flowers are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette, featuring showy red bracts with white petals, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its rocky or sandy habitat.</p>
