                    <h1>Acacia pinguiculosa</h1>
<p>Acacia pinguiculosa, commonly known as the sticky acacia, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The sticky resin has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive.</p>
