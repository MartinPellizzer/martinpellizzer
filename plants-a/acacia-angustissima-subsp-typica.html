<p>Acacia angustissima subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. The wood of Acacia angustissima subsp.</p>
<p>typica is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tools and weapons.</p>
