                <h1>Actaea spicata</h1>
<p>Actaea spicata, commonly known as red baneberry, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces distinctive red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea spicata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat branched structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel-like cluster, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dark red, fleshy berry containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and through the movement of the fruit's pulp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in shaded, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea spicata is primarily native to Afghanistan, Albania, Altay, Austria, Baltic States, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Central European Russia, Czechia-Slovakia, Denmark, East European Russia, East Himalaya, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Italy, Kazakhstan, Krym, Nepal, Netherlands, North Caucasus, North European Russia, Northwest European Russia, Norway, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., Pakistan, Poland, Romania, South European Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Transcaucasus, TÃ¼rkey, Ukraine, West Himalaya, and West Siberia. It is commonly found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. It is known for its striking white spiky flowers and is often used in horticulture.</p>
<p>Actaea spicata plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea spicata was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as part of ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>It was brought from its native range in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant has since spread into natural areas, often colonizing moist, shaded woodlands. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes local flora.</p>
