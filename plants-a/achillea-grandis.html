                <h1>Achillea grandis</h1>
<p>Achillea grandis, commonly known as the giant yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant features upright, branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are pinnately divided, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Achillea grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis has compound, serrated leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a gray-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branching, and has a grayish-brown bark with a somewhat woody texture. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and bloom from late spring to early summer, being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also cultivated in gardens and botanical collections outside its native range. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and open grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea grandis is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN, although habitat loss poses a potential threat to its natural populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis is a hardy perennial known for its showy yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and dying back in winter, with new growth emerging in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its form and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both floral resources and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and preventing land degradation.</p>
<p>Achillea grandis also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through its natural processes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis is a flowering plant known for its various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is occasionally used as a spice or herb due to its aromatic properties. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities. Industrially, it contributes to the horticultural sector, providing ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and has been used in various symbolic contexts throughout history.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are prized for their striking foliage and showy yellow to orange flower heads.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun. Hybrids of Achillea grandis have been developed to enhance traits like flower color, disease resistance, and adaptability to different soil conditions. The plant holds significant horticultural importance due to its hardiness, low maintenance requirements, and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it a valuable addition to both landscape design and native plant gardens.</p>
