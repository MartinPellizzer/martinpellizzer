                <h1>Achillea grandis</h1>
<p>Achillea grandis, commonly known as the giant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with finely serrated edges, and are aromatic when crushed.</p>
<p>Achillea grandis is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette formation and reaching up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to greyish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a achene, dispersed by wind due to its small, lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Algeria, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat degradation, Achillea grandis is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and showy yellow flowers, often used in garden landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts various wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds and leaves. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea grandis also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis is a flowering plant known for its potential medicinal uses, including its traditional application in treating wounds and inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It has also been explored for its possible culinary applications, though its use in food is limited compared to other members of the Asteraceae family. Industrially, it may contribute to the production of natural dyes and may have economic value in horticulture and landscaping. Culturally, it is associated with symbolism related to healing and protection, often found in traditional herbal practices.</p>
<p>However, its specific applications remain largely under-researched compared to more commonly studied Achillea species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea grandis has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea' and 'Moonshine', which are prized for their striking yellow foliage and showy white to pale pink flower heads.</p>
<p>Hybrid varieties have also been developed to enhance traits like disease resistance and extended bloom periods. These hybrids often combine the hardiness of Achillea grandis with the ornamental qualities of other yarrow species. In horticulture, Achillea grandis and its cultivars are valued for their ability to thrive in well-drained soils and their low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Their versatility makes them popular choices for borders, rock gardens, and wildflower mixes.</p>
