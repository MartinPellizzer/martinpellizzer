                    <h1>Agave latifolia</h1>
<p>Agave latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, often reaching up to 3 meters in height. The leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green blooms, which appear after several years.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
