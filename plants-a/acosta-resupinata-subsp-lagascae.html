                <h1>Acosta resupinata subsp. lagascae</h1>
<p>Acosta resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>lagascae, commonly known as the Lagasca's acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>lagascae has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a leathery texture. The stem is prostrate, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, white or pale pink, with a simple structure consisting of five petals and five sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habit of growing close to the ground in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>lagascae is a rare and specialized plant native to the high Andes of South America, specifically in parts of Peru and Bolivia. While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the central Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments with well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. This subspecies grows at altitudes between 3,500 and 5,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acosta resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>lagascae is a unique, low-growing plant native to the Andes, known for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to rocky environments. It can be propagated through seeds or by division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species has a slow growth cycle, thriving in cool, shady conditions with a dormant period during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of a balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is limited to removing dead or damaged foliage. It is relatively pest- and disease-resistant, though it may attract aphids in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with alpine grasses or heathers can enhance its growth and provide a natural, rugged landscape effect.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acosta resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>lagascae is a low-growing shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the habitat by offering microhabitats and improving soil structure.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acosta resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>lagascae is a lesser-known plant species with limited documented uses and applications. While it may not have significant culinary applications, it has been traditionally used in some indigenous communities for medicinal purposes, particularly for treating skin conditions and inflammation.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems have potential industrial uses, such as in the production of natural fibers or as a raw material for eco-friendly products. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in local traditions or rituals, though this remains understudied.</p>
<p>Overall, further research is needed to fully explore its economic and ecological roles.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acosta resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>lagascae has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities. Popular cultivars include 'Alba' and 'Rubra', which are noted for their striking white and red flowers, respectively.</p>
<p>Hybrids of this species are often created to enhance flower color, size, and disease resistance. These hybrids play a significant role in horticultural gardens due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Overall, Acosta resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>lagascae holds considerable horticultural importance in the cultivation of ornamental plants.</p>
