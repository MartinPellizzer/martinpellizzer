                    <h1>Acacia torticarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia torticarpa, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a small, deciduous tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its seed pods are elongated and contain edible seeds, which have been used by Indigenous Australians for food and other purposes.</p>
<p>Acacia torticarpa is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands.</p>
