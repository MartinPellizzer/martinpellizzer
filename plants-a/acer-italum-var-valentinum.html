                <h1>Acer italum var. valentinum</h1>
<p>Acer italum var. valentinum, commonly known as the Valentine maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a smooth margin and a vibrant green color during the growing season. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. valentinum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a compact, rounded form. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green sepals and no petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small, winged, and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. valentinum is a rare and endemic maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Apennine Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Calabria and Basilicata regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded forest understories, often found in temperate deciduous forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. valentinum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a slow initial phase followed by rapid expansion in its second year, reaching maturity within five to seven years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil with regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. valentinum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forested areas, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a network of ecological interactions. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape and protecting water quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. valentinum is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally employed in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>While it does not have significant medicinal applications, its wood is valued for its fine texture and is used in small-scale woodworking and furniture making. Economically, it contributes to local ecosystems and supports biodiversity, though its commercial value remains low. Culturally, it may hold symbolic meaning in certain regions, though specific traditions or associations are not well documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and ornamental than practical in everyday use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. valentinum has several popular cultivars, including 'Variegatum' and 'Tardiflorum', which are prized for their striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in various hybrids, such as with Acer palmatum, resulting in ornamental varieties that combine the best traits of both parents. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and extended flowering periods, making them more adaptable to different climates. The horticultural importance of Acer italum var. valentinum lies in its contribution to the diversity of maple collections in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its use in breeding programs highlights its value in creating new, visually appealing maple species for cultivation.</p>
