<p>Atriplex inflata, commonly known as the inflated saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for saline soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex inflata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
