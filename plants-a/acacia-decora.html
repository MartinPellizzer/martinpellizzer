                <h1>Acacia decora</h1>
<p>Acacia decora, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“5 meters. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow globular flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. Acacia decora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia decora has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its yellowish-green flowers are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, consisting of small, delicate petals and stamens, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to access water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia decora is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as regions in Baja California. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Acacia decora typically grows at elevations between 500 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as a species of concern in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia decora is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions, known for its distinctive yellow flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Fertilization should be light and applied in early spring, while pruning is necessary to maintain shape and promote flowering. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases are rare but can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia decora is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting other plant growth. Its deep root system also helps prevent soil erosion, making it an effective companion plant in restoration projects.</p>
