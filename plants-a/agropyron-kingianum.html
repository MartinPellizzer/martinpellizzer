<p>Agropyron kingianum, commonly known as King's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Agropyron kingianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
