                <h1>Actinodaphne borneensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean actinodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Borneo and is typically found in lowland dipterocarp forests. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, characterized by its aromatic leaves and smooth, greyish bark. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces drupes that are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various insect and bird species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne borneensis has elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems, with a moderate size and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that exudes a slight aromatic scent. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects.

<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne borneensis is primarily native to Borneo, Malaya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland and hill forest regions of these areas. This plant thrives in humid and tropical climates, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. It is typically associated with secondary growth and is sometimes found near riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne borneensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing as an understory plant. This species is particularly suited to areas with high rainfall and partial shade, making it a valuable addition to ornamental and ecological landscapes. Its introduction has been noted in several Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has also been cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects aimed at preserving biodiversity.</p>
