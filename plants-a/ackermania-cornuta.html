                <h1>Ackermania cornuta</h1>
<p>Ackermania cornuta, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a striking plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like bracts that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Ackermania cornuta is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackermania cornuta has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackermania cornuta is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This species thrives in areas with abundant moisture and is often associated with disturbed or flooded soils. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Ackermania cornuta is also occasionally found in other regions of the southeastern U.S. where suitable wetland conditions exist.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackermania cornuta was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and has been reported in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Ackermania cornuta is considered an invasive species in some regions, impacting local biodiversity and habitat structure.</p>
