                <h1>Achillea × dragomanii</h1>
<p>Achillea × dragomanii, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × dragomanii has leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside; they are arranged alternately along the stem and are typically 5–15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × dragomanii is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in parts of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has since been introduced to other parts of Europe, including southern Germany and Austria. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands, typically growing at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and the threats posed by habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a rare species with a vulnerable conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × dragomanii is a striking perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flower heads and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower heads to encourage rebloom and maintain shape. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or coneflower can enhance its beauty and support beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × dragomanii is a perennial flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to ecosystem balance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic compounds. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
