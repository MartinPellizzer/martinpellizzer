                    <h1>Aegilops ovata var. nigricans</h1>
<p>Aegilops ovata var. nigricans, commonly known as the black rye or black wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, glumes that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and grasslands.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
