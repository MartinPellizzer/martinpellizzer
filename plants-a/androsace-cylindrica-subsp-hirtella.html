<p>Androsace cylindrica subsp.</p>
<p>hirtella, commonly known as the hairy stalked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
