<p>Acanthophyllum microcephalum var. gracilentum, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in small inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its structure provides habitat for small desert animals and contributes to soil stabilization in its native environment.</p>
