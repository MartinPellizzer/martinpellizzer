<p>Anemonoides jenisseensis, commonly known as the Jenisse River anemone, is a flowering plant native to the boreal regions of Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink petals and a central cluster of yellow stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and in forest understories. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
<p>Anemonoides jenisseensis plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small invertebrates.</p>
