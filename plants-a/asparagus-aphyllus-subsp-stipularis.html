                    <h1>Asparagus aphyllus subsp. stipularis</h1>
<p>Asparagus aphyllus subsp.</p>
<p>stipularis, commonly known as the stipular asparagus, is a unique variant of the asparagus genus characterized by its reduced foliage. This subspecies is notable for its leafless stems, which are often covered in small, scale-like structures called stipules.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
