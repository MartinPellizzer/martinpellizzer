<p>Aristida fasciculata var. fendleriana, commonly known as the Fendler's threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-awned spikelets, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed areas and is used in some regions for erosion control due to its hardy nature.</p>
