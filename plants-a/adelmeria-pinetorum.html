                <h1>Adelmeria pinetorum</h1>
<p>Adelmeria pinetorum, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and deep green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by spherical, greenish-brown fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Adelmeria pinetorum plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelmeria pinetorum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a compact, upright form. The flowers are small, white to pink, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky soils and providing stability in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria pinetorum is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions of the country, particularly in the northern and central parts. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with forested areas and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria pinetorum was mainly introduced to areas with mild, temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in regions with southern exposure.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal environments and is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in California and parts of Oregon. This plant is typically cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly its showy, pinkish-white flowers. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly.</p>
