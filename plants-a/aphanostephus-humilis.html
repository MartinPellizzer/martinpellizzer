                    <h1>Aphanostephus humilis</h1>
<p>Aphanostephus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf steppe grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its fibrous root system helps it retain moisture in dry soils, making it resilient to drought.</p>
<p>Aphanostephus humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
