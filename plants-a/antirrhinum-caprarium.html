<p>Antirrhinum caprarium, commonly known as the alpine snapdragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of red, pink, and yellow. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, due to their shape and color.</p>
<p>Antirrhinum caprarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>
