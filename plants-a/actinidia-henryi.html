<p>Actinidia henryi, commonly known as Chinese mayapple, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Actinidia henryi is also a parent species in the development of the popular kiwifruit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia henryi has heart-shaped to ovate leaves that are alternately arranged, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing vine or shrub. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with five petals, and bloom in early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a yellowish-green berry that matures to orange-red, containing numerous small seeds, and it is dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia henryi is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Actinidia henryi is often associated with forested habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range includes parts of southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia henryi was mainly introduced to North America during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as part of botanical explorations and horticultural exchanges.</p>
<p>It was primarily distributed in regions with temperate climates, including parts of the northeastern and western United States. The plant was often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent it from becoming a nuisance species.</p>
