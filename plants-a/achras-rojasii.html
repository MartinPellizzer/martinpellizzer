                <h1>Achras rojasii</h1>
<p>Achras rojasii, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to the arid environment. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual element to its landscape. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Achras rojasii plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local biodiversity and contributing to the island's unique flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras rojasii has large, palmate leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy surface, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, fibrous capsule that splits open to release numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras rojasii is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Saint Lucia, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is commonly found in dry forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras rojasii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its large, spiky leaves and yellow flowers. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world as a horticultural plant.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific climatic requirements and the need for well-drained soil.</p>
