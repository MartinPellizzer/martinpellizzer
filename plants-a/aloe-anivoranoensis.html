<p>Aloe anivoranoensis, commonly known as the Anivorano aloe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Aloe anivoranoensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
