                    <h1>Arabis verna var. hebecarpa</h1>
<p>Arabis verna var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the early purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are rosette-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or woodland environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth form compared to other varieties of Arabis verna.</p>
