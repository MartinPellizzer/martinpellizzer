<p>Acalypha welwitschiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or flameleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or near water sources.</p>
<p>Acalypha welwitschiana is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha welwitschiana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale green to white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha welwitschiana is a shrub native to the tropical regions of southern Africa, particularly Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and parts of South Africa.</p>
