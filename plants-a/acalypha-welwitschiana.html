<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and horsetails, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and subtropical species with a wide range of growth forms. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse structures and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy flowers and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha welwitschiana, a specific type of plant within the Acalypha genus known for its distinctive appearance and native habitat in certain regions of Africa.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha welwitschiana is primarily native to Angola, Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in woodland areas or along riverbanks. The plant is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha welwitschiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of the Caribbean, southern Florida, and Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have led to its establishment in some non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated.</p>
