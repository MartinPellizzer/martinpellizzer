                    <h1>Aloe × buzairiensis</h1>
<p>Aloe × buzairiensis, commonly known as the hybrid aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of Buzwairi in the Comoros.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Aloe vera and Aloe aristata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent plants. The plant features fleshy, upright leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly found in cultivation outside of specific botanical gardens.</p>
