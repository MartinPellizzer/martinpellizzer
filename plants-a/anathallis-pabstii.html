                    <h1>Anathallis pabstii</h1>
<p>Anathallis pabstii, commonly known as the Pabst's spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender, hairy stem and a single, showy flower with intricate patterns. The plant exhibits a mycorrhizal relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Anathallis pabstii is an epiphytic plant, growing on the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
