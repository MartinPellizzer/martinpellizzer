<p>The stem is slender, often covered with soft hairs, and has a light green to pale brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petals forming a bell shape, and are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a 3-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
