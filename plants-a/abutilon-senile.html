<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to landscapes seeking both aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon senile is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can be seen growing in open woodlands or along roadsides. It is also native to parts of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
