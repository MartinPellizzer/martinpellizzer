                    <h1>Anetholea</h1>
<p>Anetholea, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, umbrella-shaped flower clusters. The plant is known for its aromatic, licorice-like scent, primarily due to the presence of anethole, a compound also found in anise and fennel. Anetholea typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine.</p>
