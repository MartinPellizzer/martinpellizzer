                        <h1>Acacia flexuosa var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Acacia flexuosa var. ambigua, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, pendulous phyllodes and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to flattened, thread-like structures called phyllodes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is often used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
