                <h1>Acrostichum palustre</h1>
<p>Acrostichum palustre, commonly known as swamp fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum palustre has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in dense clumps. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and bloom during the summer months. The fruit is a dark, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum palustre is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is commonly found in regions with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is particularly prevalent in areas with nutrient-rich soils and standing water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and its preference for warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum palustre was mainly introduced to wetland and marshy areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and along riverbanks, where it helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed sites quickly. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, Acrostichum palustre plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
