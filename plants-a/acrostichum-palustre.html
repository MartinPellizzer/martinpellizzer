                    <h1>Acrostichum palustre</h1>
<p>Acrostichum palustre, commonly known as swamp fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
