                    <h1>Argythamnia acalyphifolia</h1>
<p>Argythamnia acalyphifolia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in dry landscapes.</p>
