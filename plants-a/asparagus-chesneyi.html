                    <h1>Asparagus chesneyi</h1>
<p>Asparagus chesneyi, commonly known as the Sonoran asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>
<p>Asparagus chesneyi is often found growing in rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to its harsh native habitat.</p>
