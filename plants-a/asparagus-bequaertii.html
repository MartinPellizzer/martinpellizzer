                    <h1>Asparagus bequaertii</h1>
<p>Asparagus bequaertii, commonly known as the Desert Asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in panicles and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Asparagus bequaertii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
