                <h1>Aegiphila glandulifera</h1>
<p>Aegiphila glandulifera, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila glandulifera has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray underside due to dense glandular hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular throat, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>
