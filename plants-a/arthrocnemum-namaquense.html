                    <h1>Arthrocnemum namaquense</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum namaquense, commonly known as the Namib Desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the hyperarid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in extreme conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adapted to the brief rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in the nutrient-poor sandy soils.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum namaquense plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
