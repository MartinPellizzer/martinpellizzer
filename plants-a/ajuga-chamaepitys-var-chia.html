                    <h1>Ajuga chamaepitys var. chia</h1>
<p>Ajuga chamaepitys var. chia, commonly known as Chinese bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, partially shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread readily, making it both a desirable and potentially invasive species in certain regions.</p>
