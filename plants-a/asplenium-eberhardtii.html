                    <h1>Asplenium eberhardtii</h1>
<p>Asplenium eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with tightly packed, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Asplenium genus.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
