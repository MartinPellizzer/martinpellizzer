                    <h1>Aerva alopecuroides</h1>
<p>Aerva alopecuroides, commonly known as sand mat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming herb with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
