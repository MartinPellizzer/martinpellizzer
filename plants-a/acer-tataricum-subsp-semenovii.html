                <h1>Acer tataricum subsp. semenovii</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii, commonly known as the Tatarian maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically green on top and hairy underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in moist, cool climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii has palmately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with leaflets that are ovate to elliptical in shape, dark green on top, and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern.</p>
<p>The small yellowish-green flowers are clustered in cymes, bloom in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii is a rare subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in parts of Kazakhstan and Russia. While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in the Altai Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested or shrubland environments. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 10â€“15 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed vegetation, enhancing the stability of ecosystems. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which helps bind soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. It has potential medicinal applications due to the presence of bioactive compounds that may support respiratory and skin health.</p>
<p>In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for crafting and small-scale furniture production. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions of its native habitat, where it is revered for its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, while not as widely utilized as other maple species, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Rocket', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage. It is also commonly used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental features.</p>
<p>Hybrid forms often combine the hardiness of Acer tataricum with the showy colors of other maple species. These hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their adaptability and visual appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, the subspecies plays a significant role in landscape design due to its aesthetic qualities and resilience.</p>
