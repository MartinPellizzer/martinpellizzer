                <h1>Achillea cucullata</h1>
<p>Achillea cucullata, commonly known as the Hooded yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and has silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Achillea cucullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cucullata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically gray-green in color with a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branched, and covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are compound umbels of small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cucullata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to include parts of North Africa and the Canary Islands, though it remains most prevalent in its native range. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and grasslands, often in coastal or mountainous regions. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from urbanization and agricultural expansion, Achillea cucullata is considered a species of concern in some areas, though it is not currently listed as endangered globally.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cucullata is a hardy perennial known for its silvery-green foliage and delicate white flowers, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring or fall. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers in its second year before dying back, though it often reseeds itself for continuous growth.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like thyme or rosemary can deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cucullata is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also serves as a valuable source of food and shelter for small insects and wildlife. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea cucullata plays an important ecological role in promoting biodiversity and maintaining healthy ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
