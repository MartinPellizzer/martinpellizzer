                    <h1>Acacia ampliata</h1>
<p>Acacia ampliata, commonly known as the broadleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate and covered in fine hairs, providing a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Acacia ampliata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
