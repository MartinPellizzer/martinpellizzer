                    <h1>Agrimonia rostellata</h1>
<p>Agrimonia rostellata, commonly known as the scarlet agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Agrimonia rostellata is often found in dry meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
