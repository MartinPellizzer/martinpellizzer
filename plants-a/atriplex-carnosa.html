                    <h1>Atriplex carnosa</h1>
<p>Atriplex carnosa, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex carnosa is often found in saline soils and is adapted to high levels of salt and drought.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in such conditions makes it an important plant in ecological restoration and erosion control.</p>
