<p>Aliciella nyensis, commonly known as the Nyungwe mist fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the montane rainforests of Rwanda.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a misty veil. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aliciella nyensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
