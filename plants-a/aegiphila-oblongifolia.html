                <h1>Aegiphila oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Aegiphila oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Aegiphila oblongifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila oblongifolia has elliptical or oblong-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, glossy green surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
