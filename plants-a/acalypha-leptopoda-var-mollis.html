                        <h1>Acalypha leptopoda var. mollis</h1>
<p>Acalypha leptopoda var. mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf or silky ironleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha leptopoda var. mollis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing near rivers or in forest understories. It is also known to occur in parts of New Guinea and the western Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Indo-Malay region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha leptopoda var. mollis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. The species has since become naturalized in some areas, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread into native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in certain regions of Hawaii.</p>
