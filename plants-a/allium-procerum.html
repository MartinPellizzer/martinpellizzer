<p>Allium procerum, commonly known as the slender leek, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbous roots are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use.</p>
