                <h1>Adenocalymma calderonii</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma calderonii, commonly known as the Caldeirão flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its bark is often smooth and light-colored. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma calderonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma calderonii has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma calderonii is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. It typically grows in humid, shaded understory environments within tropical rainforests. Adenocalymma calderonii is adapted to the warm and wet climate of this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Atlantic Forest biome.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma calderonii was mainly introduced to the region of northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The plant is known for its striking yellow flowers and is commonly used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional planting by gardeners and landscapers.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
