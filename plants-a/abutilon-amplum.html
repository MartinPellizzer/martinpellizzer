                        <h1>Abutilon amplum</h1>
<p>Abutilon amplum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woollypod abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abutilon amplum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and often having jointed stems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants with showy flowers and includes families such as Malvaceae, Theaceae, and Tiliaceae. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with hairy leaves and flowers that often have five petals. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "Chinese lantern," characterized by their hairy leaves and showy, often red or yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon amplum, a specific type within the genus Abutilon, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon amplum is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the coastal areas and surrounding heathlands. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly observed in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions typical of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western part of Australia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon amplum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
