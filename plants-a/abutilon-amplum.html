<p>Abutilon amplum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a velvety texture, and the bark is smooth and light-colored.</p>
<p>Abutilon amplum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon amplum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a deep green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy and slightly woody, with a grayish-green bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals forming a funnel shape, typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon amplum is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States, specifically found in states like Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends into parts of Mexico and the Caribbean, although its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. It is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited natural populations, Abutilon amplum is listed as a threatened species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon amplum is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, maple-like leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 8 through 10, and it produces flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>
