                <h1>Acinodendron ibaguense</h1>
<p>Acinodendron ibaguense, commonly known as the Ibaguense acacia, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in botanical studies and local conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ibaguense has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ibaguense is primarily native to the western Amazon region of South America, specifically in parts of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dense tropical rainforests of the Andean foothills and adjacent lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its natural habitat includes primary and secondary forest understories, where it forms part of the complex plant community.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ibaguense was mainly introduced to Colombia, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and secondary forests. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, which contributes to its successful establishment. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
