                <h1>Acoma dissecta</h1>
<p>Acoma dissecta, commonly known as the Sierra Madre daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate and are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acoma dissecta is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoma dissecta has leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dissected appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are generally green, sometimes with a bluish tint, and have a smooth to slightly hairy surface. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows in a spreading, low shrub form. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoma dissecta is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rocky soils and dry climates. This plant is typically associated with regions such as New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Sonora. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where it can receive adequate sunlight and minimal moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoma dissecta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, disturbed forests, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in areas where native vegetation has been disrupted.</p>
