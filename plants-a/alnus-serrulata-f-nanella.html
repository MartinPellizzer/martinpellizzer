                    <h1>Alnus serrulata f. nanella</h1>
<p>Alnus serrulata f. nanella, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a compact, shrub-like form of the alder tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with finely serrated edges, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
