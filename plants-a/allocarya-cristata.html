<p>Allocarya cristata, commonly known as the crested lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus with a crustose to foliose structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Allocarya cristata is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
