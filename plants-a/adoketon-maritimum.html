                <h1>Adoketon maritimum</h1>
<p>Adoketon maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flowers and silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Adoketon maritimum plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing soil erosion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adoketon maritimum has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark with a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoketon maritimum is primarily native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean Basin, including southern Europe, northern Africa, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils along the shorelines, often found in dune ecosystems. This plant is well adapted to maritime climates with high salt exposure and strong winds. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for specialized flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoketon maritimum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and salt marshes, where it thrives in brackish or saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant has been observed spreading along shorelines, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is still considered a relatively minor invasive species in most regions.</p>
