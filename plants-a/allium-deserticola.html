<p>Allium deserticola, commonly known as the desert garlic, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, spherical bulbs that are adapted to store water and nutrients in harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Allium deserticola is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
