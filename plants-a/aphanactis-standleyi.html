                    <h1>Aphanactis standleyi</h1>
<p>Aphanactis standleyi, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant forms small, dense clusters and produces tiny, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
