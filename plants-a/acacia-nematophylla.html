                    <h1>Acacia nematophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia nematophylla, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small, hardy shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grey-green foliage and distinctive, narrow, bottle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia nematophylla is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
