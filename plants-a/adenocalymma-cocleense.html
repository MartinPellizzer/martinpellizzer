                <h1>Adenocalymma cocleense</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma cocleense, commonly known as the Cocleense adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has palmate leaves with a soft, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma cocleense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cocleense has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, and they are usually green with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. The flowers are small and clustered, with yellow petals and a distinctive central green spur, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cocleense is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks in these regions. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific climatic and soil conditions of the Amazon and surrounding areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cocleense was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern regions of the United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is typically found in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
