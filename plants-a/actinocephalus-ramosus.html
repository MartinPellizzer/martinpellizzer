                <h1>Actinocephalus ramosus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus ramosus, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and has been used traditionally for various purposes. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus ramosus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ramosus has compound, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and often branched, with a smooth, light green to pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white to pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ramosus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in grassland and rocky habitats. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soil types. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the region, making it a characteristic species of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ramosus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a horticultural plant due to its ornamental value. The distribution of this species is primarily confined to the northern regions of New Zealand. It has not been reported outside of these areas, indicating a limited range.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it is not considered invasive in the local ecosystem.</p>
