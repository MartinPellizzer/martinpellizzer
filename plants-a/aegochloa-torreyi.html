                <h1>Aegochloa torreyi</h1>
<p>Aegochloa torreyi, commonly known as Torrey's grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family and is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegochloa torreyi has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and have a bluish-green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry, three-angled capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist soil.</p>
