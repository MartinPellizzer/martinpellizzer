                    <h1>Athyrium moritzianum var. depauperatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium moritzianum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the sparse-veined wood fern, is a variant of the broadleaf wood fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often lighter in color compared to its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and covered in a dense layer of brownish scales.</p>
<p>The foliage displays a unique pattern of vein arrangement, which distinguishes it from other members of the Athyrium genus.</p>
