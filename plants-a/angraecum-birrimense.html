                    <h1>Angraecum birrimense</h1>
<p>Angraecum birrimense, commonly known as the Birrimense orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences and intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue with dark markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure suggests adaptations for specific pollinators, such as moths or bats, which are common in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum birrimense is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs.</p>
