                <h1>Adenocalymma fissum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma fissum, commonly known as the fissured adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma fissum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma fissum has small, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the autumn season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma fissum is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils along the Atlantic coastline. It is commonly observed in areas with a Mediterranean climate characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma fissum is often associated with coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma fissum was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia, where it has become naturalized in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with sandy or loamy soils and a temperate climate. The plant is often associated with open vegetation types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological zones, contributing to the local flora.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
