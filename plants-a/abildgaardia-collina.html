                        <h1>Abildgaardia collina</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia collina, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has linear leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It thrives in harsh, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Abildgaardia collina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its cold, high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia collina is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Eastern Cape Province. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. It is commonly associated with dune environments and is often found in areas with maritime climates.</p>
<p>Abildgaardia collina is a small shrub that is well adapted to the harsh coastal conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia collina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems.</p>
