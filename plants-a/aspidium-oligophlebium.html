                <h1>Aspidium oligophlebium</h1>
<p>Aspidium oligophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely veined fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a slender, elongated shape that aids in capturing light in low-light conditions.</p>
