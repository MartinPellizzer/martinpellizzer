                <h1>Adenium micranthum</h1>
<p>Adenium micranthum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces striking orange or red flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small and oval, and it has a distinctive milky sap that contains toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Adenium micranthum is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of poison for hunting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium micranthum has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green and slightly pubescent, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is thick, fleshy, and often has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are large, showy, and consist of a swollen base with three petals, usually pink or red, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium micranthum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia.</p>
<p>It thrives in hot, dry climates and is commonly found in rocky or sandy soils. This plant is also present in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, including southern Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It is often seen growing along roadsides, in savannas, and in areas with sparse vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in other dry regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium micranthum was mainly introduced to regions with dry, tropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to parts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and some areas of Asia. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance. However, it can become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native regions.</p>
