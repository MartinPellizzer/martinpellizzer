                    <h1>Amphicalea</h1>
<p>Amphicalea, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Amphicalea species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them stay afloat and reduce water loss. Their roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>The flowers of Amphicalea are usually pink, white, or yellow, and they play an important role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
