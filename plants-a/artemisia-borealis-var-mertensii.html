                    <h1>Artemisia borealis var. mertensii</h1>
<p>Artemisia borealis var. mertensii, commonly known as northern dwarf artemisia, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
