                    <h1>Anatropostylia</h1>
<p>Anatropostylia, commonly known as the "upward-facing stigma," is a specialized structure found in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It refers to the orientation of the stigma, which is positioned to face upward, facilitating pollen reception from visiting pollinators. This morphological feature is often associated with specific pollination strategies, such as attracting insects or birds. The anatropostylia is typically part of the gynoecium, the female reproductive organ of the flower.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence the plant's reproductive success by enhancing the efficiency of pollination.</p>
