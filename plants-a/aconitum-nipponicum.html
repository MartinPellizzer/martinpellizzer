                <h1>Aconitum nipponicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum nipponicum, commonly known as Japanese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are compound, with deeply cut lobes, and it has a distinctive, toxic root system.</p>
<p>Aconitum nipponicum is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains potent alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum nipponicum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a rough texture and a broad, upright arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, typically purple-tinged with a waxy coating, and grows upright with a branching pattern toward the top. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spurs, arranged in tall, dense spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often forming a dense, fibrous network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nipponicum is primarily native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of the country, particularly in the mountainous areas of Honshu, Hokkaido, and Kyushu. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is commonly found in the temperate climate zones of Japan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nipponicum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-purple flowers and attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.
