                    <h1>Acacia roxburghii</h1>
<p>Acacia roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and shed during the dry season. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a woody pod and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acacia roxburghii is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in local construction and crafts.</p>
