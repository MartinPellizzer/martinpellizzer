<p>Asplenium schottii, commonly known as the Schott's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Asplenium schottii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
