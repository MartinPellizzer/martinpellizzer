                <h1>Acrostichum polystichum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum polystichum, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a layer of dead fronds. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum polystichum has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a dark green color and a feathery appearance, arranged in a compact rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The leaves are relatively large, with a lanceolate shape and a smooth, glossy surface. The plant has a short, fibrous stem with a rough, dark brown bark that grows close to the ground. It does not produce flowers or fruits, as it is a spore-bearing plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum polystichum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. This plant is also present in the Caribbean, particularly in the Greater Antilles. It is adapted to humid climates and is often associated with coastal and floodplain environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum polystichum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, riverbanks, and other waterlogged soils where it can access abundant moisture. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. However, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, outcompeting native species for resources.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited by its need for consistent water availability and specific soil conditions.</p>
