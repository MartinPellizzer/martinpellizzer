<p>Asparagus graniticus, commonly known as the granitic asparagus, is a perennial plant native to the rocky, well-drained soils of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, triangular leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Asparagus graniticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes.</p>
