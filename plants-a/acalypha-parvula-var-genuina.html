                    <h1>Acalypha parvula var. genuina</h1>
<p>Acalypha parvula var. genuina, commonly known as the smallleaf spurge or narrowleaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are borne in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an aggressive weed in its native habitat.</p>
