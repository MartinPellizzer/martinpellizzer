                <h1>Actinolema eryngioides</h1>
<p>Actinolema eryngioides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils near the coast. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime environments.</p>
<p>Actinolema eryngioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolema eryngioides has leaves that are lanceolate, with a bluish-gray hue, arranged in a basal rosette, and measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spherical heads, with pale blue to purple petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolema eryngioides is primarily native to Iran, Iraq, Lebanon-Syria, and Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in steppe and grassland habitats. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for dry, open environments with minimal vegetation cover.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolema eryngioides was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with poor vegetation, making it a potential invasive species in certain regions. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and climates has contributed to its spread. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance, which can lead to misidentification.</p>
<p>Monitoring its distribution is important to assess its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
