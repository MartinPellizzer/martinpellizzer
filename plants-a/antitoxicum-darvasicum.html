                    <h1>Antitoxicum darvasicum</h1>
<p>Antitoxicum darvasicum, commonly known as the Moonshade Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Darva.</p>
<p>It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a characteristic that aids in its pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. Its root system is complex, with multiple tendrils that help it absorb nutrients from the rich, shaded soil.</p>
<p>Botanists note that its unique chemical composition includes compounds with potential antitoxic properties, though further research is needed.</p>
