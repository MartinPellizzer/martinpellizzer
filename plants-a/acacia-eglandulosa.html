<p>Acacia eglandulosa, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, yellow flowers that appear in globular clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, reducing water loss in arid environments. Its bark is smooth and often exhibits a silvery-gray appearance, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Acacia eglandulosa is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
