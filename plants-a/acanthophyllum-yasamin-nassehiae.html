                    <h1>Acanthophyllum yasamin-nassehiae</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum yasamin-nassehiae, commonly known as the Yasamin-Nassehia's spiny sage, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
