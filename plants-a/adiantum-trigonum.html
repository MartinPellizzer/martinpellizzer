                <h1>Adiantum trigonum</h1>
<p>Adiantum trigonum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a unique characteristic among ferns.</p>
<p>Adiantum trigonum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum trigonum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, finely divided structure, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a smooth texture and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is green in color and has a slightly fibrous texture, growing from a rhizome. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a club-shaped sorus containing spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum trigonum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forests and rocky crevices. This fern thrives in humid climates with high levels of rainfall. It is often seen growing on trees or along stream banks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Adiantum trigonum is also cultivated in many parts of the world for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum trigonum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This plant is often seen growing along the edges of water bodies and in areas with high humidity. It has become a popular ornamental species due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
