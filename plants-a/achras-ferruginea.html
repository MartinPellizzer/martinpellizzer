                <h1>Achras ferruginea</h1>
<p>Achras ferruginea, commonly known as the red cedar or bloodwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the dry regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its thick, rugged trunk and small, clustered leaves. The tree produces yellowish-white flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and traditional crafts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras ferruginea has large, palmate leaves that are broad and deeply lobed, arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing water from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras ferruginea is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant is well adapted to the dense undergrowth of these environments, where it often grows as a shrub or small tree. It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands, extending its range slightly beyond the mainland.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is an important species in the biodiversity of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras ferruginea was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems. The plant is known for its large, spiny fruit and is often used in ornamental horticulture. It has been introduced to several tropical regions for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
