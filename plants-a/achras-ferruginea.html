                <h1>Achras ferruginea</h1>
<p>Achras ferruginea, commonly known as the red-ironwood tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries that contain a single seed. Its bark is highly valued for its durability and has been traditionally used in construction and as a source of tannins.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras ferruginea has large, palm-like leaves that are broad, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and columnar, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are clustered in spadices, with small yellowish-white petals and a sweet fragrance, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras ferruginea is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Brazil and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and scattered, with populations primarily restricted to specific regions in Brazil. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on limestone outcrops. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achras ferruginea is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras ferruginea is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its striking red bark and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a long growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants can enhance its growth and provide a more diverse landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras ferruginea is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy flowers and nutritious fruits. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in the ecosystem. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering ecological benefits that sustain local wildlife and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>
