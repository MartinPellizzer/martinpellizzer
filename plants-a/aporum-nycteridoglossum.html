                <h1>Aporum nycteridoglossum</h1>
<p>Aporum nycteridoglossum, commonly known as the night-lit tongue plant, is a rare and intriguing member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that open exclusively during the evening hours, enhancing its nocturnal pollination strategy. Its native habitat is limited to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
