                <h1>Acinodendron guatemalense</h1>
<p>Acinodendron guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan acinodendron, is a tropical shrub native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron guatemalense has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are usually serrated, green in color, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like manner. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom during the summer months, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after the capsule splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron guatemalense is primarily native to Central America, particularly Guatemala and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of these countries, growing in humid, lowland areas. This plant thrives in warm and moist environments, often in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It is commonly found in the southern part of Mexico, including the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Belize and Honduras as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron guatemalense was mainly introduced to the Neotropical regions, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and secondary growth areas. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
