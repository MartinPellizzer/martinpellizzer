<p>Andropogon pedicellatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like flower clusters in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Andropogon pedicellatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
