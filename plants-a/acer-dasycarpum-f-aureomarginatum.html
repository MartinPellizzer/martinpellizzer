                <h1>Acer dasycarpum f. aureomarginatum</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. aureomarginatum, commonly known as the golden-margin maple, is a variant of the hairy maple, characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow margins on the leaves.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, red-orange fruits that persist into winter. It is native to China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaped areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. aureomarginatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a vibrant green upper surface and a yellowish margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in pendulous clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting well to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. aureomarginatum is a rare variant of the Chinese maple, native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and over-collection. It thrives in temperate forests with moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and declining population, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. aureomarginatum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant yellow leaf margins and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 5-7.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials such as heuchera can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. aureomarginatum is a decorative tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby flora through improved soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality by absorbing pollutants.</p>
