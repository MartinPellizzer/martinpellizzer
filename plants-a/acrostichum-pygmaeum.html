                <h1>Acrostichum pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pygmaeum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pygmaeum has small, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a narrow, elongated shape.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that contains tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pygmaeum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils, often found near rivers or in swampy habitats. This fern is commonly associated with disturbed sites and can be found in both natural and human-altered environments. Its distribution extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pygmaeum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in salt marshes and estuarine environments where it thrives in brackish water conditions. This plant is often associated with tidal zones and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its presence has been documented in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
