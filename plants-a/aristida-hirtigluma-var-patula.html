                    <h1>Aristida hirtigluma var. patula</h1>
<p>Aristida hirtigluma var. patula, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that produce dense clusters of tiny, silky, hair-like leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance ground covers.</p>
