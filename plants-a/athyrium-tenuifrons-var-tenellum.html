<p>Athyrium tenuifrons var. tenellum, commonly known as the slender-leafed lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The varietal form, tenellum, is distinguished by its narrower and more elongated leaves compared to the typical variety.</p>
