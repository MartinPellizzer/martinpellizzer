                <h1>Achnatherum bloomeri</h1>
<p>Achnatherum bloomeri, commonly known as the Blomer's needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Achnatherum bloomeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum bloomeri has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is usually clump-forming. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of small, spikelet-like structures, each bearing two to three florets, and they are usually pale green to brown in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>
