                <h1>Actinophloeus sanderianus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus sanderianus, commonly known as the Sander's actinophloeus, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenia plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and oval-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus sanderianus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus sanderianus is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from Virginia to Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This species thrives in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks, where it benefits from the salty air and well-drained conditions. It is an important component of the coastal ecosystems in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species in many parts of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus sanderianus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is now considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
