                <h1>Adenia aculeata</h1>
<p>Adenia aculeata, commonly known as the prickly adenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its woody stems and thorny branches. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are often followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenia aculeata is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia aculeata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green with red streaks, clustered in axillary inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia aculeata is primarily native to Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in areas with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight. Adenia aculeata is often associated with dry savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of East Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia aculeata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with warm temperatures and high humidity. This plant is often found in coastal areas and near rivers where the soil remains consistently moist. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
