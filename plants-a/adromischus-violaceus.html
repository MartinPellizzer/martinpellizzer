<p>Adromischus violaceus, commonly known as the violet crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically violet or purple in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or violet during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect sunlight and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Adromischus violaceus is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for indoor cultivation.</p>
