                <h1>Adenandra serpyllacea</h1>
<p>Adenandra serpyllacea, commonly known as the common adenandra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra serpyllacea has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly roughened with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra serpyllacea is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with sandy or gravelly soils, often in open grasslands and coastal areas. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is particularly common along the coastlines of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces in South Africa.</p>
<p>Adenandra serpyllacea is well adapted to coastal conditions and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra serpyllacea was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the eastern and western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, small, white flowers. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
