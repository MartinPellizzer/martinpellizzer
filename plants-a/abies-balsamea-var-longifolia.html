                        <h1>Abies balsamea var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Abies balsamea var. longifolia, commonly known as the Canadian fir, is a variant of the balsam fir native to eastern Canada and the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly longer than those of the typical balsam fir. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal and subalpine forests.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and for its use in reforestation efforts.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
