                    <h1>Alopecurus agrestis var. minor</h1>
<p>Alopecurus agrestis var. minor, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It features fine, hairless leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. The plant is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands across temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
