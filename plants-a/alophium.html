                    <h1>Alophium</h1>
<p>Alophium, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent shrubs are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Native to southern Africa, Alophium species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in their fleshy leaves and stems. The plant's toxic sap contains cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful to animals and humans.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive features, Alophium is cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in some regions.</p>
