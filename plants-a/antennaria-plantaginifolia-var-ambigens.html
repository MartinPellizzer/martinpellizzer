<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its leaves are usually basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
