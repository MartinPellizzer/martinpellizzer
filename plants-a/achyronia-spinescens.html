                <h1>Achyronia spinescens</h1>
<p>Achyronia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, dark purple berries that mature in the fall. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia spinescens has leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered in spines, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia spinescens is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and California. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. It is often found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the necessary conditions for its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia spinescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun exposure and moderate to well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive and is often found in small, localized populations.</p>
