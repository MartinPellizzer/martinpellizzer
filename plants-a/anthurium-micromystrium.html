                    <h1>Anthurium micromystrium</h1>
<p>Anthurium micromystrium, commonly known as the miniature anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the understory of humid forests in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which can be white or pale pink in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
