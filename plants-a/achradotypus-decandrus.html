                <h1>Achradotypus decandrus</h1>
<p>Achradotypus decandrus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and it is well adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achradotypus decandrus has small, ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green color and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small and clustered, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradotypus decandrus is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils within these areas. The plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often seen growing on termite mounds or in dry, well-drained habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the Namib Desert and the surrounding Kalahari Basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradotypus decandrus was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and resilience to drought.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown potential to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its invasive tendencies. The plant's ability to establish itself in new environments has led to its inclusion in some invasive species monitoring programs.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the need for careful management to prevent ecological disruption in native habitats.</p>
