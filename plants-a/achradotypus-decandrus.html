                    <h1>Achradotypus decandrus</h1>
<p>Achradotypus decandrus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and it is well adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
