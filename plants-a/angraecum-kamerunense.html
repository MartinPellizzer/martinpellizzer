                    <h1>Angraecum kamerunense</h1>
<p>Angraecum kamerunense, commonly known as the Cameroon star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Cameroon and neighboring regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hawkmoths, which are attracted by their nectar and the plant's night-blooming habit.</p>
<p>Angraecum kamerunense is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the local ecosystems of its native habitat.</p>
