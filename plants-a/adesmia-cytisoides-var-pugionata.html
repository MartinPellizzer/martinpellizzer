                    <h1>Adesmia cytisoides var. pugionata</h1>
<p>Adesmia cytisoides var. pugionata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burro's tail, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, narrow, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, bean-like seed pods that are often used in traditional medicine. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in dryland environments.</p>
