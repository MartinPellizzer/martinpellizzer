<p>Axillaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or in moist, shaded environments, often without soil, relying on its host for nutrients.

<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in conservation efforts.</p>
