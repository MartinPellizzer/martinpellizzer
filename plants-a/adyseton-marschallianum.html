<p>Adyseton marschallianum, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves and tall, erect flowering stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by showy, hood-like bracts. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Adyseton marschallianum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
