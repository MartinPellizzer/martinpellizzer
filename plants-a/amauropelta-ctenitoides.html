<p>Amauropelta ctenitoides, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense cluster of leaves.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
