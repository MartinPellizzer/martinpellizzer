                    <h1>Athyrium leiboense</h1>
<p>Athyrium leiboense, commonly known as the Leibo's shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Athyrium leiboense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
