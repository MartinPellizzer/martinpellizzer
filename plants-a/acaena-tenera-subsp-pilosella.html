                        <h1>Acaena tenera subsp. pilosella</h1>
<p>Acaena tenera subsp.</p>
<p>pilosella, commonly known as the silky burr, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its ability to form extensive colonies, which can be both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena tenera subsp.</p>
<p>pilosella is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of Canterbury and Otago.</p>
<p>This subspecies grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation such as grasslands and scrublands.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena tenera subsp.</p>
<p>pilosella was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period.</p>
<p>This species is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its invasive potential.</p>
