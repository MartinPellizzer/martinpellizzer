                <h1>Acosmus pruriens</h1>
<p>Acosmus pruriens, commonly known as the itching bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, with various parts used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as skin conditions and inflammation. Its leaves and seeds contain compounds that have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antifungal effects.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shrublands and forest edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmus pruriens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dull green color, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and covered with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels off in flakes. The flowers are small, clustered in dense panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmus pruriens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, fertile soils. This plant thrives in open woodland, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of sunlight and adequate moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmus pruriens was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with low vegetation cover. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both tropical and subtropical regions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it requires careful management in areas where it is not native.</p>
