                    <h1>Alyssum atlanticum</h1>
<p>Alyssum atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming throughout the summer months. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Alyssum atlanticum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies.</p>
