                <h1>Aegonychon calabrum</h1>
<p>Aegonychon calabrum, commonly known as the Calabrian thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegonychon calabrum has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
