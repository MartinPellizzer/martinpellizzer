                <h1>Acinodendron planinervium</h1>
<p>Acinodendron planinervium, commonly known as the flat-veined acinodendron, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with smooth margins and flat, parallel veins. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and typically have four to five petals.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron planinervium has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slight ridged texture. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron planinervium is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing as an understory species. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron planinervium was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, wastelands, and abandoned agricultural fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces make it effective for land rehabilitation.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature.</p>
