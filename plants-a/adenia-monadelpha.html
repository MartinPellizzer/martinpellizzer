                <h1>Adenia monadelpha</h1>
<p>Adenia monadelpha, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with five petals and a distinctive crown-like structure. Its fruit, which is edible, is typically yellow or orange when ripe and has a sweet, sometimes tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Adenia monadelpha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia monadelpha has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a rough, brownish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and zygomorphic, with a deep red color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant anchor itself and store nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia monadelpha is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the island, where the climate is tropical and humid. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forests or along stream banks. It is an important part of the local flora and contributes to the biodiversity of Madagascar's unique ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia monadelpha was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering structures.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
