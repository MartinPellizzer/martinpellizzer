                <h1>Acer suberosum</h1>
<p>Acer suberosum, commonly known as the red-flowered maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. The tree has a slender, upright growth habit with smooth, reddish-bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are palmate with five to seven lobes, turning vibrant yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes, and is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged蒴果, which disperses by wind due to its light, feathery structure.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes, typically at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change, Acer suberosum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique and ecologically important tree species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum is a small, ornamental tree known for its striking red bark and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer suberosum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species through improved soil conditions. Its deep roots help in erosion control by stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and offering habitat for small animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits, though its leaves may be used in traditional teas.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat various ailments, including inflammation and respiratory issues, though scientific validation is lacking. Industrially, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, but it has minimal economic value compared to more common maple species. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely ecological and traditional, with potential for further research into its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Pendulum', which are known for their striking foliage and unique growth habits. Hybrid varieties have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and flowering intensity. These cultivars and hybrids are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in various climates and their aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to the diversity of maple species in ornamental plantings.</p>
