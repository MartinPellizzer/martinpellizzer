                <h1>Acer suberosum</h1>
<p>Acer suberosum, commonly known as the red maple or red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>Acer suberosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its moist, temperate habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum is a rare tree species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Europe and North America, where it is often cultivated in botanical gardens. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is typically found in mixed forests or on rocky slopes. This species grows at elevations between 800 and 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer suberosum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique bark.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer suberosum involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of surrounding vegetation. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer suberosum plays a role in improving soil quality by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, known for its ornamental value and various practical uses.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its young leaves can be used in traditional dishes, though it is not widely consumed. Medicinally, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and renewal due to its seasonal growth patterns.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer suberosum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Pendulum' and 'Sutherlandii', which are admired for their unique foliage and branching patterns. Hybrids of Acer suberosum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them a desirable addition to gardens and landscapes.</p>
