                <h1>Acrostichum hastatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Acrostichum hastatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hastatum has leaves that are broadly triangular to ovate in shape, with a sharp, pointed tip and a wavy margin, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are large, typically reaching up to 30 cm in length, and are dark green on the upper surface with a lighter, sometimes silvery underside. The stem is robust and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a clumping pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruits are spherical, spiky berries that mature to a bright red color, dispersing their seeds through animal consumption and dropping.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hastatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with high moisture levels and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in areas with seasonal flooding.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from Mexico down through the Caribbean and into northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hastatum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in wetlands and tidal marshes. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive rhizome system. It has become naturalized in some areas, spreading beyond its original introduction.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
