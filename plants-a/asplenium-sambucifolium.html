<p>Asplenium sambucifolium, commonly known as the sambucus-leaved spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks.</p>
<p>Asplenium sambucifolium is a relatively uncommon species, with a limited geographic distribution.</p>
