<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, dense vegetation. The plant exhibits a compact growth form with short, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salt conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
