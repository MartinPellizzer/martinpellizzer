<p>Antrophyum annetii, commonly known as the Ann√©tii tree, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashews and mangoes, and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Antrophyum annetii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
