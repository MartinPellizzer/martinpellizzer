                <h1>Aegilops cylindrica</h1>
<p>Aegilops cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is known for its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Aegilops cylindrica is also of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contribution to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops cylindrica has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a cylindrical spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and hard.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>
