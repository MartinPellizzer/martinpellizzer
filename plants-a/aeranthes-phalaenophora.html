                    <h1>Aeranthes phalaenophora</h1>
<p>Aeranthes phalaenophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, showy flowers that resemble a ghostly figure. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and it relies on specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that help attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aeranthes phalaenophora is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
