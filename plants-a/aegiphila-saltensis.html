<p>Aegiphila saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Aegiphila saltensis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
