<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha ferdinandi belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of vascular plants with a long evolutionary history, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants known for their diverse morphological features and ecological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with unique floral structures and often produces toxic sap. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cup plants," characterized by their often hairy foliage and showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha ferdinandi, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, distinguished by its unique morphological traits and geographic distribution.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ferdinandi is primarily native to Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Gulf, and Mexico Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas in Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ferdinandi was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread is facilitated by its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means.</p>
