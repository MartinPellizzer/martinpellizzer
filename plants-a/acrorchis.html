                    <h1>Acrorchis</h1>
<p>Acrorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, relying on epiphytic relationships for nutrients and moisture. Acrorchis has a short, slender stem with a single, showy flower that blooms once a year.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
