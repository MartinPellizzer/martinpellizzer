<p>Agropyron intermedium var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand wheatgrasses, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing,丛生 structure and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>This hardy species is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
