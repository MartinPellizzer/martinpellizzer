                <h1>Achillea erioclada</h1>
<p>Achillea erioclada, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and basal leaves that are often grayish-white due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Achillea erioclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea erioclada has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a silvery-white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets in a flat, yellowish-green cluster, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively and anchor itself in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea erioclada is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, with populations occurring in rocky and gravelly slopes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited population size, Achillea erioclada is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea erioclada is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstock in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea erioclada is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea erioclada plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining healthy ecosystems.</p>
