                    <h1>Arthrosolen ornatus</h1>
<p>Arthrosolen ornatus, commonly known as the ornate rock orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures and specialized adaptations for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology includes elongated, sometimes twisted stems and showy, fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
