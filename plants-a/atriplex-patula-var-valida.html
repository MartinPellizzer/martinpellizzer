<p>Atriplex patula var. valida, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, sage-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate high salinity and arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
