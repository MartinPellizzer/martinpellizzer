                    <h1>Asplenium sordidum</h1>
<p>Asplenium sordidum, commonly known as the stinking spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has slender, dark green fronds with a distinctive, often foul-smelling odor. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Asplenium sordidum is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
