<p>Andryala cheiranthifolia var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features small, green, succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
