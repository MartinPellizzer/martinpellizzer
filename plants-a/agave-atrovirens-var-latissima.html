                    <h1>Agave atrovirens var. latissima</h1>
<p>Agave atrovirens var. latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are broader than those of most other agave species, often reaching widths of up to 30 centimeters. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces a tall flowering stalk with yellowish-green flowers, though it rarely blooms in cultivation.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its striking appearance and adaptability to dry climates.</p>
