                        <h1>Abutilon listeri</h1>
<p>Abutilon listeri, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and foliage give it a distinctive, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Abutilon listeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abutilon listeri belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, including horsetails and some extinct groups. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants that often have showy flowers and include families such as Malvaceae. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with palmate leaves and capsule fruits. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants known for their distinctive, often fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon listeri, a specific type of plant within the genus Abutilon, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon listeri is primarily native to Christmas Island.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this remote island in the Indian Ocean. The plant thrives in the moist, shaded understory of the forest canopy. It is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the island.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon listeri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. It competes with native vegetation, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
