<p>Acantholimon ulicinum subsp.</p>
<p>lycaonicum, commonly known as the Lycaonic saltbush, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as drought and salt exposure. Its leaves are typically covered in a layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal and inland saline habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
