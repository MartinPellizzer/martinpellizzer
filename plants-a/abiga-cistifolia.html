<p>Abiga cistifolia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and thorny stems. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually small and deciduous, and it produces small, red fruits that are edible but have a sour taste.</p>
<p>The plant has traditional medicinal uses in some African communities.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abiga cistifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid, and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil, making it a common species in xeric habitats. It is also found in some parts of the Middle East and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the climate and topography of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abiga cistifolia was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in abandoned fields. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments. It is often used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-target areas.</p>
