                    <h1>Acoma</h1>
<p>Acoma, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus *Hesperaloe* in the family Xanthorrhoeaceae, which is closely related to the asparagus family. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiky flower stalks that bear clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in the summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Acoma is well adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species.</p>
