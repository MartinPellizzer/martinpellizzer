                    <h1>Arum incurvatum</h1>
<p>Arum incurvatum, commonly known as the curling arum, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that curl inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Arum incurvatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
