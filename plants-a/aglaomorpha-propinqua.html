<p>Aglaomorpha propinqua, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale green leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can perform photosynthesis to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Aglaomorpha propinqua is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
