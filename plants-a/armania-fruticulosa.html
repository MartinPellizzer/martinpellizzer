                    <h1>Armania fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Armania fruticulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources.</p>
<p>Armania fruticulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
