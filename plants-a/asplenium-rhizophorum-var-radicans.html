                    <h1>Asplenium rhizophorum var. radicans</h1>
<p>Asplenium rhizophorum var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally along the soil surface. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in rocky crevices or along the bases of trees in temperate regions.</p>
