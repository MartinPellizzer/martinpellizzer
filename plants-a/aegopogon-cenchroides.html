                <h1>Aegopogon cenchroides</h1>
<p>Aegopogon cenchroides, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Aegopogon cenchroides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopogon cenchroides has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, low-growing shrub form. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with small, dry seeds that are released when the capsule dries and splits.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
