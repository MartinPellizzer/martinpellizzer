<p>Argocoffeopsis rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>thonneri, commonly known as the Thonner's rock coffee plant, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
