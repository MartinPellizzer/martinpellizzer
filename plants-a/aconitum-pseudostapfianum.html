                    <h1>Aconitum pseudostapfianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum pseudostapfianum, commonly known as the Himalayan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxicity, but it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
