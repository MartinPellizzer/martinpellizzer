                <h1>Acalypha abortiva</h1>
<p>Acalypha abortiva, commonly known as the staghorn plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a deer's antlers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or red, often hidden among the foliage. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acalypha abortiva is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha abortiva has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 3–6 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a light green to brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes rough with age. It produces small, clustered flowers with five pale yellow to greenish petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed蒴果 (capsule) that splits open to release three tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha abortiva is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, likely due to human introduction. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or near water bodies. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to around 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though habitat loss poses a potential threat to its future distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha abortiva is a flowering plant known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value, commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few weeks and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ornamental grasses can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>
