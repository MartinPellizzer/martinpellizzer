                        <h1>Acalypha abortiva</h1>
<p>Acalypha abortiva, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous root system that anchors it to trees or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules.</p>
<p>Acalypha abortiva is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha abortiva is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland areas, often near rivers or in swampy habitats. The plant thrives in humid climates and is typically found in dense vegetation or along forest edges. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, where it grows in similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to wet, nutrient-rich soils and is often part of the undergrowth in tropical rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha abortiva was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking exotic plants for gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads through both seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact on local ecosystems.</p>
