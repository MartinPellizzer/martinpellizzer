                <h1>Abrotanum pulverulentum</h1>
<p>Abrotanum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty abrotanum, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrotanum pulverulentum has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and slightly woody, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, featuring five petals and stamens, and bloom in early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum pulverulentum is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in southern Europe, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it is sometimes cultivated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as coastal cliffs, grasslands, and woodland edges. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abrotanum pulverulentum is a hardy annual plant known for its small, delicate flowers and is commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown directly in the garden or started indoors as transplants, with germination typically occurring within 7-14 days. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 60-90 days, making it suitable for short-season gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer at planting time promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its compact shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
