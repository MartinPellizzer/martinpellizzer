                    <h1>Asplenium yoshinagae var. planicaule</h1>
<p>Asplenium yoshinagae var. planicaule, commonly known as the flat-leaf rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically on rocky substrates or in crevices within forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves and are protected by a thin, hairy covering.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
