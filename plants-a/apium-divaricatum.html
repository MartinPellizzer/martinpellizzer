<p>Apium divaricatum, commonly known as the clustered parsley or wild celery, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with finely divided, feather-like leaves that emit a distinctive parsley-like scent when crushed. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense, branched clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Apium divaricatum is often found in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in temperate climates.</p>
