<p>Acer ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves that vary in shape and size depending on the environment. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer ambiguum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.</p>
