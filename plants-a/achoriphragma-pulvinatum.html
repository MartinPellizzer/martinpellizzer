                <h1>Achoriphragma pulvinatum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma pulvinatum, commonly known as the pulvinate acorid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acoraceae, which includes a small group of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a distinctive, club-shaped inflorescence. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas with standing water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pulvinatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, consisting of five petals and stamens, and bloom in spring, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat for efficient water and nutrient uptake.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pulvinatum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Baja California. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pulvinatum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in areas with disturbed land.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with sandy or gravelly soils, often along roadsides and in degraded habitats. The plant forms dense mats that help prevent wind and water erosion. It is particularly valued for its rapid establishment and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively in some environments, potentially displacing native vegetation.</p>
