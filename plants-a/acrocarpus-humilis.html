                <h1>Acrocarpus humilis</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sycamore, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. Its small, spherical flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis is often found in lowland evergreen forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences; they bloom during the dry season and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils in tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including Australia and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced for ornamental or horticultural purposes. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations are threatened by habitat loss and deforestation in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acrocarpus humilis is relatively slow, with moderate growth in warm climates and a dormant phase during cooler seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the tree and promote air circulation are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis is a versatile plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, which aid in its reproduction and support local pollination networks. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native vegetation to enhance soil health and stability. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind soil and prevent runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acrocarpus humilis supports soil fertility by improving nutrient cycling and promoting a healthier habitat for surrounding flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves are used as a vegetable in traditional dishes, particularly in Southeast Asia. Medicinally, it has been utilized in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Industrially, the plant contributes to the local economy through its use in basket weaving and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often representing resilience and community.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatus' and 'Pendulus', which are appreciated for their unique leaf coloration and cascading growth habit. While natural hybrids of Acrocarpus humilis are relatively rare, some horticulturists have attempted crossbreeding to enhance specific traits. These cultivars hold horticultural importance in tropical gardens and as indoor plants due to their aesthetic appeal and resilience.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to biodiversity and provides options for landscape design in warm climates.</p>
