                <h1>Acrocarpus humilis</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis, commonly known as the small-leaf ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and durability make it valuable for timber and traditional uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, particularly in the Philippines and New Guinea. It thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary growth forests.</p>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus humilis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in tropical regions of Oceania.</p>
<p>It has been widely planted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in degraded soils. The distribution includes countries such as Fiji, Samoa, and Vanuatu, where it is used for reforestation and land stabilization. It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
