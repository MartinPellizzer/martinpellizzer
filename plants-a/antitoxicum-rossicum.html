                    <h1>Antitoxicum rossicum</h1>
<p>Antitoxicum rossicum, commonly known as the Rossic毒草, is a rare and toxic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant contains potent alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are broad and lanceolate, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is rarely cultivated and is typically found only in specific, remote habitats.</p>
