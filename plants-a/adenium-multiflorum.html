                <h1>Adenium multiflorum</h1>
<p>Adenium multiflorum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a striking plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and smooth, pale green bark. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenium multiflorum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its trunk.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium multiflorum has thick, fleshy, and often lobed leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is short and thick, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that has a distinctive swollen base. The flowers are large, showy, and typically pink or red, with a tubular shape and a long, slender stamen; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and adapted to store water, helping the plant survive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium multiflorum is primarily native to Eswatini, KwaZulu-Natal, Malawi, Mozambique, Northern Provinces, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing near rivers, in savannas, and on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Adenium multiflorum is an important species in the local ecosystems and has cultural significance in many of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium multiflorum was mainly introduced to regions where it is used for ornamental purposes and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It has been spread across parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia due to its unique appearance and cultural significance. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and along roadsides because of its striking red flowers and succulent stems. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is needed to prevent it from becoming a weed in non-native environments.</p>
