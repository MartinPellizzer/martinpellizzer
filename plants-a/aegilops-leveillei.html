                <h1>Aegilops leveillei</h1>
<p>Aegilops leveillei, commonly known as the Levillâ€™s goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. Aegilops leveillei is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops leveillei has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range from 10 to 30 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, growing upright with a branching pattern near the top. The plant produces spikelet-like flowers in early summer, with small, pale green to brown florets that are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
