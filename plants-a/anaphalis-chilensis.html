<p>Anaphalis chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean goatweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with its hairy, silver-green foliage. Its flowers, which appear in the form of small, clustered heads, are often white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Anaphalis chilensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
