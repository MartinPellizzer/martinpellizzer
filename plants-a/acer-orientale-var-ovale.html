                <h1>Acer orientale var. ovale</h1>
<p>Acer orientale var. ovale, commonly known as the oval-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. ovale has palmately lobed leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a dark green upper surface that turns reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. ovale is a variant of the oriental maple, native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and northern Syria.</p>
<p>It is currently found in scattered populations across its native range, with some cultivated specimens in botanical gardens and private collections. This plant thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of near threatened.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. ovale is a decorative maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. ovale is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>This plant plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting both plant and animal life in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. ovale is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, making it valuable for conservation efforts. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in traditional Chinese landscapes and gardens.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems and aesthetic appeal makes it an important plant for both environmental and ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. ovale has several popular cultivars that are highly valued for their ornamental qualities, such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Sargentii', which exhibit striking foliage colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also serves as a parent in various hybrids, including the popular 'Autumn Flame' and 'Emerald Queen', which combine the best traits of its parent species. These hybrids often display enhanced cold hardiness and improved fall color, making them more adaptable to different climates. The horticultural importance of Acer orientale var. ovale lies in its contribution to the diversity of maple trees in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics continue to inspire breeding programs aimed at developing new cultivars with improved aesthetics and resilience.</p>
