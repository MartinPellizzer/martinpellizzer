                    <h1>Anapausia aliena</h1>
<p>Anapausia aliena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cypress swamps.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
