<p>Arenaria serpyllifolia subsp.</p>
<p>viscida, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its sticky, glandular leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
