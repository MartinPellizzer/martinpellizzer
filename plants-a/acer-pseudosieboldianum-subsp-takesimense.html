                <h1>Acer pseudosieboldianum subsp. takesimense</h1>
<p>Acer pseudosieboldianum subsp.</p>
<p>takesimense, commonly known as the Takezima maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows to a height of 8â€“12 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively hardy in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudosieboldianum subsp.</p>
<p>takesimense has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a broad base and a slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter, turning vibrant red in the fall. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures, exhibiting a tree-like growth pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in early spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudosieboldianum subsp.</p>
<p>takesimense is a rare maple species native to southern Japan, specifically found in the Ryukyu Islands. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations on the island of Kuchinoerabu.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within evergreen forests, typically growing in areas with high humidity and rich soil. This subspecies is found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudosieboldianum subsp.</p>
<p>takesimense is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials such as hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudosieboldianum subsp.</p>
<p>takesimense is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest understories, supporting the growth of other native species. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining local microclimates and enhancing overall forest resilience.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudosieboldianum subsp.</p>
<p>takesimense is a rare and ornamental tree native to Japan, primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscaping. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, though research is limited.</p>
<p>The tree contributes to local biodiversity and may play a minor role in supporting wildlife, though it lacks significant industrial or economic importance. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in traditional Japanese settings, though its specific role in cultural symbolism is not well documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary use remains in ornamental horticulture and ecological contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudosieboldianum subsp.</p>
<p>takesimense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities. Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Takii', which are known for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>This species has also been hybridized with other maples, such as Acer palmatum, to produce unique varieties with enhanced ornamental features. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of climates and its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>These traits make it a favored choice for landscape designers and gardeners alike.</p>
