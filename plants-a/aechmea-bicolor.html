                <h1>Aechmea bicolor</h1>
<p>Aechmea bicolor, commonly known as the pink bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green stripes, adding visual interest.</p>
<p>Aechmea bicolor is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea bicolor has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, grass-like, and dark green with a silvery underside, arranged in a compact spiral at the base.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, with the base forming a tight, leafy rosette and the flower spike emerging directly from the center. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its bromeliad-like rosette, helping to retain water and nutrients.</p>
