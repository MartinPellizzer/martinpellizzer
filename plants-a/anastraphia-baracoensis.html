<p>Anastraphia baracoensis, commonly known as the Baracoensian sandbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Anastraphia baracoensis plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
