                <h1>Acer glabrum var. typicum</h1>
<p>Acer glabrum var. typicum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. typicum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, displaying a bright green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. typicum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it thrives in temperate forests. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. typicum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. typicum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its early spring blossoms. Its dense growth acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting soil health through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. typicum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has historical medicinal applications, particularly in traditional medicine for treating respiratory ailments and inflammation. While not widely used in industry, its wood is valued for crafting small decorative items and furniture. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and ornamental than commercial.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. typicum has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Orange Star', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to varieties like the 'Emerald Queen' and 'Red Sunset' maples, which exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and more consistent coloration compared to the species itself. Horticulturally, Acer glabrum var. typicum is valued for its adaptability to urban environments and its ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids are widely used in landscaping for their aesthetic appeal and seasonal interest.</p>
