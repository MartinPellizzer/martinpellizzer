<p>Acer opalus var. opulifolium, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin and a pale green underside, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands.</p>
