<p>Avena sterilis var. glabrescens, commonly known as slender oat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and slender, often hairless stalks. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
