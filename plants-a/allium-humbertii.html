                    <h1>Allium humbertii</h1>
<p>Allium humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert onion, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Corsica.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous plant that produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its native habitat. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valuable plant for both culinary and ecological purposes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium humbertii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity.</p>
