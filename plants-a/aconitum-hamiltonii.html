                <h1>Aconitum hamiltonii</h1>
<p>Aconitum hamiltonii, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple or blue flowers that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves and produces toxic alkaloids, making it both a valuable and dangerous species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling due to its toxicity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum hamiltonii has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are deeply divided, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and covered with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its native alpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum hamiltonii is primarily native to the Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and northern Myanmar.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude areas with cool, moist climates and is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is also present in parts of China, particularly in the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous terrain at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided by livestock and humans, making it a rare but significant plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum hamiltonii was mainly introduced to gardens and naturalized areas in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its striking blue to purple flowers and has become a popular ornamental plant. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in parts of Europe and North America.</p>
