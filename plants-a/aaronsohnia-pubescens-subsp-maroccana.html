<p>Aaronsohnia pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan Aaronsohn's cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It is a small, shrub-like plant with distinctive, scale-like leaves that are densely covered in fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
