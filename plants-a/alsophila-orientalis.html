<p>Alsophila orientalis, commonly known as the oriental tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its vertical growth and helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating reproduction.</p>
<p>Alsophila orientalis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
