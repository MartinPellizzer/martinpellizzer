                        <h1>Acalypha alnifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha alnifolia, commonly known as silky ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used for commercial purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha alnifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems in some parts of its range.</p>
<p>Acalypha alnifolia is valued for its ornamental features and has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha alnifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. However, it has since become a weed in some regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and human activity.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
