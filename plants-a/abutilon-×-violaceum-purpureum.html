<p>This hybrid plant is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and riverine habitats. The plant is known for its striking purple and pink flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the biodiversity of its native wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon × violaceum-purpureum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides where it thrives in disturbed soils and full sun.
