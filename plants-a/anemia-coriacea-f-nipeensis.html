                    <h1>Anemia coriacea f. nipeensis</h1>
<p>Anemia coriacea f. nipeensis, commonly known as the Nipean skin-leaf plant, is a unique variant of the genus Anemia, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in the Caribbean, particularly in the island of Cuba. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with a compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
