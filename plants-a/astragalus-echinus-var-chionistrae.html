                    <h1>Astragalus echinus var. chionistrae</h1>
<p>Astragalus echinus var. chionistrae, commonly known as the snow-haired milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, needle-like leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance.</p>
