<p>Avicennia officinalis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It has small, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in coastal conditions. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>This variant is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions along coastlines.</p>
