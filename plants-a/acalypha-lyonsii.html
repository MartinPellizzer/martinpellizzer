                <h1>Acalypha lyonsii</h1>
<p>Acalypha lyonsii, commonly known as Lyon's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by distinctive bracts. Its leaves are usually oval or elliptical with smooth edges and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Lyon's spurge is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha lyonsii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with red stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha lyonsii is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, specifically found in countries such as Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the southern United States and the Caribbean, where it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in lowland areas. Acalypha lyonsii is usually found at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 600 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited native range and potential for habitat loss due to land development raise concerns for its long-term conservation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha lyonsii is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, papery bracts that resemble flowers, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method, especially during the spring or early summer. This plant thrives in warm climates and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and summer promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier growth. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases may occur in overly wet conditions, so proper air circulation and care are essential.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha lyonsii is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, colorful flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in coastal and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acalypha lyonsii contributes to ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a range of native species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acalypha lyonsii is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific, known for its ornamental value and traditional uses.</p>
