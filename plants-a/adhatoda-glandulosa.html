                <h1>Adhatoda glandulosa</h1>
<p>Adhatoda glandulosa, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with five petals and a distinctive tubular shape. Its roots are notable for their medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine for respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda glandulosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a rough, bark-like texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a tubular structure and a coloration of pink to purple, blooming during the rainy season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda glandulosa is primarily native to tropical and southern regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshy areas, and along the edges of rivers and streams. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is also present in some parts of Africa and Australia, though its distribution is more restricted there.</p>
<p>The species is well-adapted to moist environments and plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda glandulosa was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in gardens and along roadsides. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and trade, leading to its presence in some non-native areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of its introduced ranges.</p>
