<p>Aconitum arcuatum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a helmet-like shape on tall, sturdy stems. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous species.
