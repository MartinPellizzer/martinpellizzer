                <h1>Acrotriche platycarpa</h1>
<p>Acrotriche platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited acrotriche, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature and may change color as they ripen. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Acrotriche platycarpa is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche platycarpa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
