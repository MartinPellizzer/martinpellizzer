                <h1>Achimenes diceros</h1>
<p>Achimenes diceros, commonly known as the red-flowered achimenes, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Achimenes diceros is typically propagated through stem cuttings and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes diceros has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement and range from 5 to 10 cm in size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tubular with a spurred lip, coming in shades of pink to purple, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes diceros is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in the eastern part of the country. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Achimenes diceros is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
