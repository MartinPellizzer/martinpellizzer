                <h1>Acronia batracha</h1>
<p>Acronia batracha, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a type of orchid native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple veins. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acronia batracha plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia batracha has leaves that are elongated and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia batracha is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in states like Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina. It prefers well-drained soil and is often associated with rocky or wooded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia batracha was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in forest understories where it can receive partial sunlight. This plant has been observed spreading along the edges of wetlands and stream banks. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a weed in some regions where it has become invasive.</p>
