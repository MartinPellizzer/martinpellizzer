                    <h1>Acronia batracha</h1>
<p>Acronia batracha, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a type of orchid native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple veins. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acronia batracha plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species.</p>
