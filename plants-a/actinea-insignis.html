                <h1>Actinea insignis</h1>
<p>Actinea insignis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces a unique, aromatic resin that has been historically valued for its use in incense and traditional medicine. Actinea insignis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea insignis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle containing seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea insignis is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from New York to Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in rich, organic soils and is often associated with deciduous forests. It is also known to occur in parts of southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic and ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea insignis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, often thriving in urban environments. The plant's ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds contributes to its successful establishment in non-native regions. It has been reported in several countries outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains largely undocumented.</p>
