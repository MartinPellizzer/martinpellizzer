                    <h1>Astragalus hirtulus</h1>
<p>Astragalus hirtulus, commonly known as hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus hirtulus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration ecology.</p>
