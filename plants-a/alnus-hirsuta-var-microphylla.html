                    <h1>Alnus hirsuta var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Alnus hirsuta var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its small, elliptical leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly in regions of China and the Himalayas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along streams.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession.</p>
