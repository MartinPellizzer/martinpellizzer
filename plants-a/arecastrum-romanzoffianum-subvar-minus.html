<p>Arecastrum romanzoffianum subvar. minus, commonly known as the lesser areca palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized palm with a slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are usually a deep green color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that is typically orange or red in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
