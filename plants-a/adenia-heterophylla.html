                <h1>Adenia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Adenia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf adenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Adenia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia heterophylla has leaves that are alternate, simple, and vary in shape from ovate to elliptic, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals, and are usually pink to red in color, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps anchor the plant in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia heterophylla is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with creeklines and rocky outcrops. Its distribution extends along the eastern coast of Australia, where it grows in humid, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Adenia heterophylla is also occasionally found in parts of Southeast Asia, though its primary range remains within Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia heterophylla was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the eastern coast. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in open forests or heathlands. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, leading to ecological concerns in certain regions.</p>
