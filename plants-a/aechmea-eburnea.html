<p>Aechmea eburnea, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, spathate inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea eburnea is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
