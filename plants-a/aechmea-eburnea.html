                <h1>Aechmea eburnea</h1>
<p>Aechmea eburnea, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, spathate inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea eburnea is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea eburnea has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically broad, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, grass-like texture and a pale green to silver-gray color.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, with bright red or orange flowers that bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its rocky or epiphytic habitat.</p>
