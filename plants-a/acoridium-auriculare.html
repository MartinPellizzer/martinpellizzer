                <h1>Acoridium auriculare</h1>
<p>Acoridium auriculare, commonly known as the golden ear orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble ears, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Acoridium auriculare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium auriculare has leaves that are broad, ovate, and often auriculate at the base, arranged in a basal rosette, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the foliage. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium auriculare is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies where the soil remains consistently moist. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with riparian zones and coastal areas. Its distribution is also observed in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Acoridium auriculare is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium auriculare was mainly introduced to New Zealand as a horticultural plant due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It was originally native to South America, specifically Brazil, and was brought to New Zealand in the 19th century. The plant has since become established in the wild, particularly in coastal and urban areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some regions of New Zealand.</p>
