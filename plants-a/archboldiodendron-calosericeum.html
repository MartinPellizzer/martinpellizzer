                <h1>Archboldiodendron calosericeum</h1>
<p>Archboldiodendron calosericeum, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, white berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as the koa and ohia, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. It plays a unique ecological role in the Hawaiian ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity through its interactions with native birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
