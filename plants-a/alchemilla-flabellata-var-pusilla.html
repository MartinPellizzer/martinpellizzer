                    <h1>Alchemilla flabellata var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Alchemilla flabellata var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.</p>
