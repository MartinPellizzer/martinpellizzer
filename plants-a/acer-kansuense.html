<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or mountainous environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kansuense is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of western China, specifically in the provinces of Gansu, Sichuan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across these areas, growing in temperate forests and shrublands at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in mixed coniferous and broadleaf forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Acer kansuense is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kansuense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended.
