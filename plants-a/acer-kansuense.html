                <h1>Acer kansuense</h1>
<p>Acer kansuense, commonly known as the Kansu maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a smooth margin and a bright green upper surface. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kansuense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod that disperses by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kansuense is a deciduous tree native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Gansu, Sichuan, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within these regions, often in mountainous terrain. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Acer kansuense is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kansuense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its striking orange-red foliage in autumn.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for germination. The growth cycle involves a slow initial growth phase followed by steady development, reaching maturity in about 10-15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kansuense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting the local ecosystem's reproductive processes. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer kansuense plays a role in carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kansuense is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and crafts. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. It also holds cultural significance in certain regions, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer kansuense plays a role in both environmental conservation and local economies through its timber and ecological contributions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer kansuense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Globosum' and 'Jugen', which are appreciated for their unique foliage and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acer kansuense are often created to enhance traits such as color, hardiness, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>
<p>They are widely used in ornamental horticulture for their vibrant autumn colors and elegant form.</p>
