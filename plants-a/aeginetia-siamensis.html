                <h1>Aeginetia siamensis</h1>
<p>Aeginetia siamensis, commonly known as the Siam apple or Siamese apple, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Aeginetia siamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia siamensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat trailing habit. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season; they are wind-pollinated due to their lack of showy petals. The fruit is a spherical, woody drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>
