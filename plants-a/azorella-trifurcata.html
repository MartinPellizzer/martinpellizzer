                    <h1>Azorella trifurcata</h1>
<p>Azorella trifurcata, commonly known as the Chilean tree moss, is a unique evergreen plant native to the Andes Mountains of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it has a distinctive root system that can form extensive mats. Azorella trifurcata is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ability to survive in extreme climates make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
