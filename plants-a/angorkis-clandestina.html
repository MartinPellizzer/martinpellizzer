                    <h1>Angorkis clandestina</h1>
<p>Angorkis clandestina, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of deep purple and violet, often resembling miniature orchids. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture and dappled sunlight to flourish. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
