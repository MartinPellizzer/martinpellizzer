                <h1>Adiantum guilelmi</h1>
<p>Adiantum guilelmi, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum guilelmi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum guilelmi has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 20â€“30 cm in length, exhibiting a pale green to silvery-gray coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a simple, branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, with a structure consisting of separate sepals and stamens, typically pale green in color, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, club-shaped sorus containing numerous spores, and the plant relies on wind for spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that anchors the plant and absorbs nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum guilelmi is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically occurring in parts of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. This fern is commonly found in areas with rich, acidic soil and high humidity. It is often associated with stream banks and rocky outcrops in these regions.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum guilelmi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be due to both natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
