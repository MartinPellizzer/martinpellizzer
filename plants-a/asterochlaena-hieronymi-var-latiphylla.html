                    <h1>Asterochlaena hieronymi var. latiphylla</h1>
<p>Asterochlaena hieronymi var. latiphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed asterochlaena, is a rare and distinctive member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the late spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
