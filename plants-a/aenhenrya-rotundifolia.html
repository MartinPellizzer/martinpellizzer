                <h1>Aenhenrya rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Aenhenrya rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed enigmatic plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aenhenrya rotundifolia has rounded, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
