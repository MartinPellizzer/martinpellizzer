                    <h1>Adenophora palustris f. leucantha</h1>
<p>Adenophora palustris f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that are predominantly white, with a subtle pink or purple hue at the base. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, setting it apart from the typical blue or purple-flowered forms of the species.</p>
