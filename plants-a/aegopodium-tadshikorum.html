                <h1>Aegopodium tadshikorum</h1>
<p>Aegopodium tadshikorum, commonly known as the Tibetan ground-ivy, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Tibet and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent component of its native ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium tadshikorum has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, with small seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached bristles.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
