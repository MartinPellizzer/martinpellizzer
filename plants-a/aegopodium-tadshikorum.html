                    <h1>Aegopodium tadshikorum</h1>
<p>Aegopodium tadshikorum, commonly known as the Tibetan ground-ivy, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Tibet and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent component of its native ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
