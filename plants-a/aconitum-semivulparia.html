                <h1>Aconitum semivulparia</h1>
<p>Aconitum semivulparia, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum semivulparia has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and greenish-blue in color, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>
