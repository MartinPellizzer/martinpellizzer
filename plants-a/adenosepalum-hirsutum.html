                <h1>Adenosepalum hirsutum</h1>
<p>Adenosepalum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy adenosepalum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide it with a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with five sepals that are often hairy, giving the plant its scientific name.</p>
<p>Adenosepalum hirsutum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum hirsutum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and somewhat woody, with a rough texture and a light brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum hirsutum is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Panama and Costa Rica. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with lowland forests and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum hirsutum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant has become a notable invasive species in these regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for certain wildlife species.</p>
