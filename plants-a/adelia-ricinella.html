                <h1>Adelia ricinella</h1>
<p>Adelia ricinella, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Adelia ricinella is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia ricinella has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia ricinella is primarily native to Cayman Is., Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Netherlands Antilles, Puerto Rico, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>This species is found throughout the Caribbean region, including various islands and coastal areas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant is commonly associated with humid, warm ecosystems and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans multiple islands in the Caribbean, highlighting its adaptability to diverse local conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia ricinella was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for its ornamental value due to its attractive, palm-like appearance. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered an environmental weed because it can outcompete native plants and alter ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
