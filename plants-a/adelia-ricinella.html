                    <h1>Adelia ricinella</h1>
<p>Adelia ricinella, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Adelia ricinella is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
