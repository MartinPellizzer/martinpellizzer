                        <h1>Acalypha finitima</h1>
<p>Acalypha finitima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with lance-shaped leaves and small yellowish-green flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it identifiable by its unique leaf morphology and flowering pattern.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha finitima is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland areas with high humidity and warm temperatures. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and agricultural lands. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha finitima was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wet forest habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact and habitat disruption.</p>
