<p>Androlepis, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in sandy and rocky soils. Androlepis species are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and their small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance.</p>
