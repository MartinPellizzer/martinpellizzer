                    <h1>Ayenia mastersii</h1>
<p>Ayenia mastersii, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and white, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Ayenia mastersii is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it thrives in the canopy of its host trees.</p>
