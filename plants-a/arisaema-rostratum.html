<p>Arisaema rostratum, commonly known as the spiny arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spatula. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is often surrounded by a hood-like structure called a peduncle. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
