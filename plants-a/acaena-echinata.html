<p>Acaena echinata, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acaena echinata is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena echinata has compound, alternate leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, dark green in color, and ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often branched, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene enclosed in a spiny bract, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the lightweight, hairy structures attached to them.</p>
