                        <h1>Acaena echinata</h1>
<p>Acaena echinata, commonly known as the bristly acaena, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, thorn-like stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its hairy foliage and robust structure make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Acaena echinata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acaena echinata belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, including horsetails and some aquatic plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Rosales, a group of flowering plants that includes roses, strawberries, and other plants with showy flowers. Its family is Rosaceae, known as the rose family, which includes a wide variety of plants with simple leaves and flowers typically having five petals.
