                <h1>Acer stenolobum</h1>
<p>Acer stenolobum, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a valuable ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in the fall. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum is a species of maple native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Appalachian region. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring a humid climate. This species typically grows at elevations between 300 and 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer stenolobum is considered a vulnerable species and is listed as endangered in some states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer stenolobum includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells, but is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or leaf spot, and it pairs well with native grasses and wildflowers in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control, preventing soil loss in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different stages of the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum is a species of maple tree native to the southeastern United States, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
