<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum, commonly known as the Amur maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or stream valleys.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, with a wind-pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan. While its native range was historically limited, it is now cultivated in various regions outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks or in woodland edges. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, leading to a conservation status that warrants further monitoring.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
