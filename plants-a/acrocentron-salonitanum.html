                <h1>Acrocentron salonitanum</h1>
<p>Acrocentron salonitanum, commonly known as the Mediterranean water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the surface. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with some floating leaves at the surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or white in color.</p>
<p>Acrocentron salonitanum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocentron salonitanum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron salonitanum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and limestone soils along the shores of countries such as Italy, Spain, France, and Morocco. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often associated with rocky or cliff habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific microclimates that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron salonitanum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and anthropogenic habitats, such as roadsides, waste sites, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and is often found in regions with moderate to high rainfall. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it a common weed in agricultural and industrial areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can pose challenges in ecological restoration projects.</p>
