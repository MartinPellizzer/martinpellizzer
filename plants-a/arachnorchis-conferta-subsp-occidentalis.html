<p>Arachnorchis conferta subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like floral structure, which is both ornamental and adapted for specific pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spiders, aiding in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, the species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
