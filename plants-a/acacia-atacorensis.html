                    <h1>Acacia atacorensis</h1>
<p>Acacia atacorensis, commonly known as the Atacorensis acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly found in Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant has bipinnate leaves, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in local medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Acacia atacorensis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and crafts.</p>
