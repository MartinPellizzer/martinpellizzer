                    <h1>Andropogon scoparius var. genuinus</h1>
<p>Andropogon scoparius var. genuinus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to drought.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and role in stabilizing soil.</p>
