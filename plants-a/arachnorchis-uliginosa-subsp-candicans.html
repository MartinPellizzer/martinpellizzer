<p>Arachnorchis uliginosa subsp.</p>
<p>candicans, commonly known as the showy spider-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like floral structure with long, slender petals and a prominent, club-shaped lip.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet heathland and swampy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. It blooms during the cooler months, producing vibrant pink or purple flowers that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing.</p>
