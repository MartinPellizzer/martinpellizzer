                <h1>Adelia sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Adelia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-fig, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, fleshy fruits that resemble small globes, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>Adelia sphaerocarpa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia sphaerocarpa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 3 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a spherical, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia sphaerocarpa is primarily native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Pilbara and Geraldton areas, where the climate is hot and dry. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia sphaerocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and rocky outcrops. This plant is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
