                        <h1>Acantholippia seriphioides</h1>
<p>Acantholippia seriphioides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholippia seriphioides is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, including chaparral and scrublands. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to specific ecological zones characterized by well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholippia seriphioides was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Oregon. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and trail construction.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
