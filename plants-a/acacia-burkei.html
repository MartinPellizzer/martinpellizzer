<p>Acacia burkei, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flower heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its deep root system. Its flowers are an important food source for native pollinators, including bees and birds.</p>
<p>Acacia burkei is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia burkei is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, rocky outcrops, and along riverbanks in these areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia burkei is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia burkei was mainly introduced to regions with semi-arid to arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for dryland environments. This plant has been introduced to parts of Australia, the United States, and other regions with similar climatic conditions.
