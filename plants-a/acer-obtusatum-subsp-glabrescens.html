                <h1>Acer obtusatum subsp. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous on the upper surface.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens has leaves that are ovate to broadly ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length and 3–6 cm in width. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning yellow to red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, and it is wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule, which is dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forest understories. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall color and unique foliage. It can be propagated through seed or hardwood cuttings, with seed requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species exhibits a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate to high acidity and requires regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native species. The plant also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages.</p>
<p>Industrially, it contributes to local biodiversity and may support ecological tourism in its native regions. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in indigenous communities, representing resilience and connection to the land.</p>
<p>Its role in the environment highlights its importance in maintaining forest ecosystems and supporting wildlife.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Sutherlandii', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to the development of unique varieties with enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and extended foliage color, making them suitable for a wider range of climates. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of cultivated maples in landscaping and public gardens.</p>
