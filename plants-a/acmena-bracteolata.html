                <h1>Acmena bracteolata</h1>
<p>Acmena bracteolata, commonly known as the flame tree or flame acacia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear throughout the year. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is smooth and often greyish in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acmena bracteolata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena bracteolata has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena bracteolata is a species native to eastern Australia, primarily found in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions within its native range. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey areas. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acmena bracteolata is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmena bracteolata is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within 1-2 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with regular watering during the growing season.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring and summer supports healthy growth, while pruning in late winter encourages bushier foliage. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmena bracteolata is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acmena bracteolata contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through organic matter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmena bracteolata is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses across various fields.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some local communities may utilize its leaves for traditional purposes. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy. Industrially, it may contribute to ecological systems by supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain indigenous communities, where it is sometimes revered for its natural resilience and beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acmena bracteolata has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Bailiwick' and 'Barramundi', which are known for their vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>While there are no widely recognized hybrids of Acmena bracteolata, it is often crossbred with related species to enhance desirable traits such as cold tolerance and disease resistance. The plant holds significant horticultural importance due to its adaptability to various climates and its ability to thrive in both container and in-ground settings. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for landscape design, particularly in shaded or semi-shaded areas.</p>
<p>Overall, Acmena bracteolata contributes to the diversity of ornamental foliage plants in horticultural collections.</p>
