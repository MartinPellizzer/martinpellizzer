                <h1>Acmena bracteolata</h1>
<p>Acmena bracteolata, commonly known as the silky acmena, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, often in spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a soft, silky texture.</p>
<p>Acmena bracteolata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract native pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena bracteolata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing a single seed, which is dispersed by birds consuming the fruit and excreting the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena bracteolata is primarily native to eastern and northern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in rainforest, coastal scrub, and woodland habitats. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is typically associated with humid, warm climates. Its distribution extends into parts of New Guinea and the Torres Strait Islands.</p>
<p>Acmena bracteolata is an important component of the local flora in these areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena bracteolata was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for use in landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm climates, particularly in the eastern and northern parts of the country. Although it is not native to Australia, it has been cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value. However, it is important to note that its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, it remains a popular choice for horticultural purposes in the region.</p>
