<p>Adiantum lunulatum var. delicatulum, commonly known as the moon's tears fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bright green fronds with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. The fronds are typically arched and have a soft, feathery texture, with small, spoon-shaped pinnae that give it a graceful look. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in hanging baskets or as a houseplant.</p>
