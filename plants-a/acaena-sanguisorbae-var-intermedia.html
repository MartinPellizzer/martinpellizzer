<p>Acaena sanguisorbae var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bracken burr, is a variant of the bracken burr plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense growth habit and spiny, woody stems. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are compound, with multiple pairs of leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in forest understories and is adapted to the temperate climate of its native region.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae var. intermedia is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in temperate grasslands and shrublands, often growing in well-drained soils. It thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and is adapted to a range of elevations. The plant is part of the Rosaceae family and is known for its spiny structures and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its ecological preferences and historical range across the southern Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae var. intermedia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species with similar ecological characteristics. This variety is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, pastures, and forest margins. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various habitats, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in a range of soil types and its tolerance to environmental stress contribute to its successful spread.</p>
