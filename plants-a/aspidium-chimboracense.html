                    <h1>Aspidium chimboracense</h1>
<p>Aspidium chimboracense, commonly known as the Chimborazo water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium chimboracense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
