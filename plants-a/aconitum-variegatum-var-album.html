                    <h1>Aconitum variegatum var. album</h1>
<p>Aconitum variegatum var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are typically blue or purple, though the var. album variant is notable for its white petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for areas with young children or pets.</p>
