<p>Arenaria ciliata var. subuniflora, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
