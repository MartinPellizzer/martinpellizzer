<p>Avena capillaris subsp.</p>
<p>provincialis, commonly known as the provincial oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, scrublands, and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
