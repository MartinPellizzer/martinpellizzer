                    <h1>Azorella bryoides</h1>
<p>Azorella bryoides, commonly known as the cushion moss plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant is composed of small, closely packed stems and leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, moss-like structures. Azorella bryoides is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms.</p>
