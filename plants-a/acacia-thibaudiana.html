                        <h1>Acacia thibaudiana</h1>
<p>Acacia thibaudiana, commonly known as the Tibaud's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and these are typically narrow and linear. Acacia thibaudiana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia thibaudiana is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid regions of the island, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This species thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry forests, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the tropical climate and can tolerate both drought and seasonal flooding.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia thibaudiana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Australia and has been introduced to other regions with similar climates. The plant is commonly used in landscaping and for soil stabilization in degraded areas. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
