<p>Arbutus pilosa, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and glossy, dark green leaves that turn orange-red in the fall. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist through winter. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>Arbutus pilosa is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
