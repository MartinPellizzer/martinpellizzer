                <h1>Acrocomia zapotecis</h1>
<p>Acrocomia zapotecis, commonly known as the Zapotec palm, is a species native to Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Puebla.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm with a smooth, gray trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia zapotecis has palm-like leaves that are long, narrow, and linear, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture and grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after the fruit splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid environment by efficiently absorbing moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia zapotecis is primarily native to southern Mexico, specifically the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas, growing in dry to semi-humid climates. This plant thrives in lowland areas with well-drained soils, often in forests or on rocky slopes. It is an important species for both ecological and cultural reasons in the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique environmental conditions of the Zapotec cultural area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia zapotecis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm temperatures and moderate rainfall, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Central and South America. This plant is often used for its edible fruits and ornamental value, contributing to both local agriculture and horticulture. Its introduction has also supported biodiversity in certain ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by specific environmental conditions that must be met for successful growth.</p>
