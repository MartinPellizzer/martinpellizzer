                    <h1>Apera spica-venti var. prorepens</h1>
<p>Apera spica-venti var. prorepens, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in open fields. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are wind-dispersed, contributing to its common name. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-green hue when young.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly prostrate growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
