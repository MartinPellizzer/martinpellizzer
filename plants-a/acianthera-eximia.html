                <h1>Acianthera eximia</h1>
<p>Acianthera eximia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Acianthera eximia is valued for its beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera eximia has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale pink to white color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera eximia is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. This orchid thrives in humid, tropical climates with ample rainfall and partial shade. It typically grows in mountainous areas and cloud forests, where the conditions are ideal for its survival.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the specific ecological niche of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera eximia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its showy, violet-colored flowers. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a non-native species that may compete with local plants.</p>
