                <h1>Adolia rubra</h1>
<p>Adolia rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed adolia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to harsh environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolia rubra has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading just below the soil surface to absorb moisture and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia rubra is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and in swampy areas. This plant is commonly found in the Florida Keys and the coastal regions of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It is often associated with hammocks and other humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adolia rubra plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia rubra was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate and can tolerate a range of soil pH levels. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Adolia rubra can outcompete native plants, leading to ecological concerns in some areas.</p>
