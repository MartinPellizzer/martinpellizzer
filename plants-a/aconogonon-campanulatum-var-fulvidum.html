<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconogonon campanulatum var. fulvidum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five lobes, and are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon campanulatum var. fulvidum is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now found in a few isolated locations within its native habitat. This plant thrives in humid, shaded forest environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
