<p>Arabis lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring.
