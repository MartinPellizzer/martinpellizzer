                <h1>Achyrophorus ciliatus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus ciliatus, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that have ciliate margins. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in the eastern United States.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus ciliatus has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus ciliatus is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with floodplain environments. Its range extends from New Jersey to Florida and westward into Texas.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the wetland ecosystems where it is found.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus ciliatus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions where its native range has been expanded through intentional or accidental introduction. This plant thrives in environments with full sun and moderate moisture levels. Its spread has been documented in several regions outside its original distribution.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
