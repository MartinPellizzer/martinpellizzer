                    <h1>Achyrophorus ciliatus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus ciliatus, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that have ciliate margins. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in the eastern United States.</p>
