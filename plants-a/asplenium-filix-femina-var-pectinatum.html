                    <h1>Asplenium filix-femina var. pectinatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium filix-femina var. pectinatum, commonly known as the Hart's Tongue fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are dark green and often have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
