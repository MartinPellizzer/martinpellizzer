                <h1>Acer drummondii</h1>
<p>Acer drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and adaptability to arid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer drummondii has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven pointed lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning bright red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind as the samaras are carried by the breeze.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its rocky or gravelly habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer drummondii is a species of maple native to the southwestern United States, primarily found in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in its native range. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyons. It typically occurs at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer drummondii is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer drummondii is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage, commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy and ensure successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer drummondii includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter, making it a hardy plant suitable for temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, preferring full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy development, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its visual appeal and create a vibrant garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer drummondii is a native shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a valuable companion plant in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its presence also enhances biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by offering habitat and resources throughout the growing season.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer drummondii is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often planted in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in some traditional herbal teas.
