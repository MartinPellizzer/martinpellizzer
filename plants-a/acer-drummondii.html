<p>Acer drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and seasonal color changes.</p>
