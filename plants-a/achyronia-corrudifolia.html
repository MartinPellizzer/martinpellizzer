                    <h1>Achyronia corrudifolia</h1>
<p>Achyronia corrudifolia, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, floating leaves that help it remain buoyant in water. It is typically found in coastal areas, estuaries, and marshes where salinity levels fluctuate.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions.</p>
