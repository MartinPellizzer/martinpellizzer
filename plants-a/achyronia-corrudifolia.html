                <h1>Achyronia corrudifolia</h1>
<p>Achyronia corrudifolia, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, floating leaves that help it remain buoyant in water. It is typically found in coastal areas, estuaries, and marshes where salinity levels fluctuate.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia corrudifolia has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a pale green bark that becomes rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a subtle pink tinge, featuring four petals and a central cluster of stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia corrudifolia is primarily native to the western regions of the United States, particularly in states such as Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, including deserts and rocky soils. This plant thrives in areas with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. It is often associated with sagebrush steppe and other dryland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic ranges within these western states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia corrudifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the eastern United States. This plant has been introduced to several states, including North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. It is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
