<p>Atriplex repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant has a branched stem system that allows it to spread and colonize disturbed soils effectively. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Atriplex repanda is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
