                <h1>Adelphia hiraea</h1>
<p>Adelphia hiraea, commonly known as the small-leaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a fibrous root system. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that mature in the fall.</p>
<p>Adelphia hiraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelphia hiraea has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale yellow petals and a scent that attracts pollinators; they bloom in early summer and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelphia hiraea is primarily native to Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Panam√°, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family and is known for its climbing habit.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans a wide geographic area within Central and South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelphia hiraea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. The plant has since spread into natural areas, becoming a weed in moist, disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further invasion of local ecosystems.</p>
