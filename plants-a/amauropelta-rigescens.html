<p>Amauropelta rigescens, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically upright and stiff, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
