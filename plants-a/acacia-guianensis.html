<p>Acacia guianensis is primarily native to South America, specifically the countries of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas of these regions. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acacia guianensis is also occasionally found in neighboring regions of northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
