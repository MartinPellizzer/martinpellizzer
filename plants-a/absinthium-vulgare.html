                <h1>Absinthium vulgare</h1>
<p>Absinthium vulgare, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Wormwood is notable for its high concentration of volatile oils, including thujone, which contributes to its bitter taste and historical use in absinthe.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium vulgare has lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellow petals and a distinctive central disk, blooming in late summer and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule containing tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium vulgare is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is now found across much of Europe, including the British Isles, and has been introduced to other regions such as North America.
