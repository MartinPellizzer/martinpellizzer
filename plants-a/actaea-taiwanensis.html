                <h1>Actaea taiwanensis</h1>
<p>Actaea taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan bugbane, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Actaea taiwanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea taiwanensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and reddish-brown, with a slightly woody texture, growing upright and branching at the base. The flowers are white and clustered in upright cymes, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate, dispersing seeds through animal ingestion and fecal spread.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in its spread and anchoring it in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea taiwanensis is primarily native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the island, particularly in the central and eastern areas. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its distinctive red flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Taiwan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea taiwanensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with well-drained soil and moderate humidity, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and botanical collections. This plant is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its striking purple or white flowers. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is sometimes grown as an exotic species.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems if it escapes cultivation.</p>
