                    <h1>Astragalus nivalis</h1>
<p>Astragalus nivalis, commonly known as the snow vetcher, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or arctic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Astragalus nivalis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
