<p>Arisaema amurense f. serratum, commonly known as the serrated arrowroot, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and clusters of spadices that produce small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is not as widely utilized as other arrowroot species.</p>
