                <h1>Acinodendron longicaudatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron longicaudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Acinodendron longicaudatum is often found in dry, scrubland habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron longicaudatum has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size of about 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron longicaudatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas within these regions. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high levels of rainfall throughout the year. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found along forest edges or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the broader tropical biome of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron longicaudatum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative propagation make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
