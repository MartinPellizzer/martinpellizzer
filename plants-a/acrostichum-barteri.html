                <h1>Acrostichum barteri</h1>
<p>Acrostichum barteri, commonly known as the Barter's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Acrostichum barteri is often found growing near water sources such as streams and swamps.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum barteri has large, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slight fibrous texture. It produces inconspicuous, spadix-like flowers that are yellow-green in color, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum barteri is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is often seen growing on rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum barteri was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological imbalance in coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
