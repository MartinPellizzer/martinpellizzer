                <h1>Adiantum laetum</h1>
<p>Adiantum laetum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically pale green with a silvery sheen on the underside. This plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Adiantum laetum is often found growing in woodlands and along stream banks, where it forms dense, carpet-like colonies.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings and indoor cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum laetum has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a delicate, finely serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, single-seeded capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and spread across moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum laetum is primarily native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with calcareous soils. Its native range extends across countries like France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hardy species that can adapt to a variety of microhabitats within its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum laetum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern is often seen in gardens and naturalized areas due to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
