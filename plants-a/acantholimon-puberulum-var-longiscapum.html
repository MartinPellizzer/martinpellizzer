                    <h1>Acantholimon puberulum var. longiscapum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon puberulum var. longiscapum, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its adaptations include succulent leaves and deep root systems, which enable it to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats.</p>
