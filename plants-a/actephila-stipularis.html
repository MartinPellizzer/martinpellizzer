                <h1>Actephila stipularis</h1>
<p>Actephila stipularis, commonly known as the stipular actephila, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila stipularis has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila stipularis is primarily native to Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this Indonesian island. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly observed in lowland and montane regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Sulawesi.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila stipularis was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands through human activity, particularly as part of horticultural practices.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, vacant lots, and along riverbanks. The plant has adapted well to these environments, often outcompeting native species due to its rapid growth and high reproductive capacity. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological effects in these regions.</p>
