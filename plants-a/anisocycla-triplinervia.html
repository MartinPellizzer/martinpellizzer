                    <h1>Anisocycla triplinervia</h1>
<p>Anisocycla triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The leaves are triplinerved, meaning they have three distinct veins running from the base to the tip. This plant is native to certain regions of South America and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of ancient plant lineages and their evolutionary adaptations.</p>
