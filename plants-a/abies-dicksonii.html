<p>Abies dicksonii, commonly known as the Dickson's fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for an extended period. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>The plant has ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies dicksonii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high altitudes, ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level. This species thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is an important component of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies dicksonii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. This species is often planted in urban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions.
