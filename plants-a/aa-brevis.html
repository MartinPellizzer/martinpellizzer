                        <h1>Aa brevis</h1>
<p>Aa brevis, commonly known as the short-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its compact, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant's rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Aa brevis is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it often grows in dense, humid forests.</p>
<p>Its delicate, feathery appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aa brevis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate to dry conditions. This plant is often found in regions with sandy or gravelly soils. Its introduction has been documented in several states across the southeastern United States.</p>
