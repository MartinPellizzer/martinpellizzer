                    <h1>Anguloa × intermedia</h1>
<p>Anguloa × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid angel's trumpets, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Anguloa chilensis and Anguloa leucophaea.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Ecuador. The plant produces large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a strong, sweet fragrance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.</p>
