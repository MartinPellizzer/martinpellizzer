<p>Antirrhinum siculum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular-flowered sand rocket, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, ascending stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a glandular underside. The flowers are typically pink or red, with two lips and a spur, typical of the plant family Plantaginaceae. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its leaves and stems help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
