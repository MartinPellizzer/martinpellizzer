                <h1>Acalypha integrifolia subsp. panduriformis</h1>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>panduriformis, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Its stems are typically green and have a slightly woody texture, while the leaves are usually glossy and alternate along the stem.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>panduriformis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside. The leaves are alternate in arrangement, varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, and are often slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pale greenish-white bracts that enclose the tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small, dry, and equipped with feathery structures for aerial dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>panduriformis is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Its current distribution includes parts of tropical regions where the climate remains warm and humid.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist lowland forests and swampy areas, often near water bodies. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>panduriformis is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf shapes. It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in a warm, humid climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during cooler months. It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, but it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-tolerant plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>panduriformis is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, colorful inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in coastal and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>panduriformis is a plant with limited culinary use, primarily due to its bitter taste and lack of widespread cultivation for food purposes. It has been traditionally used in some regions for its medicinal properties, including treatments for skin conditions and as a remedy for inflammation.</p>
<p>While not heavily utilized in industrial applications, its fibers may have potential for eco-friendly textiles or paper production. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain indigenous communities, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely underexplored, with more research needed to fully understand its potential uses.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>panduriformis has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Beauty' and 'Variegata', which are known for their striking foliage colors and unique leaf shapes. It also has been used in hybridization with other Acalypha species to produce varieties that exhibit enhanced growth habits and improved resistance to pests and diseases.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display a broader range of leaf colors and patterns, making them highly desirable in modern horticultural practices. Due to its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions, it holds significant horticultural importance in both landscape design and container gardening.</p>
<p>Its use in ornamental plantings has contributed to its popularity among gardeners and landscape designers worldwide.</p>
