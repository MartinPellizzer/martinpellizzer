<p>Ajuga orientalis var. condensata, commonly known as carpet bugle or narrowleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and extended blooming period.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground covers.</p>
