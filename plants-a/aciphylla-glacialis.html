                <h1>Aciphylla glacialis</h1>
<p>Aciphylla glacialis, commonly known as the glacier carrot or snow carrot, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with dense, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in alpine ecosystems. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in extreme conditions make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Aciphylla glacialis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla glacialis has a compact, low-growing structure with dense, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are closely arranged along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are short and branching, with a rough, bark-like texture and a bluish-green color, forming a cushion-like growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in the rocky, alpine environments where it thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla glacialis is primarily native to New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the alpine regions of these states. It thrives in rocky and dry environments, often growing on slopes and ridges. Aciphylla glacialis is adapted to cold climates and is often seen in areas with poor soil.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla glacialis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare alpine species found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like form and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. This plant is typically found in regions with limited soil and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its distribution is restricted to specific areas in Antarctica and surrounding sub-Antarctic islands.</p>
<p>The introduction of Aciphylla glacialis to the dataset highlights its ecological significance in these extreme environments.</p>
