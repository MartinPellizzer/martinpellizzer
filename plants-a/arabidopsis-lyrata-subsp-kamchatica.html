<p>Arabidopsis lyrata subsp.</p>
<p>kamchatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of eastern Siberia and the Far East. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, exhibiting a compact growth habit and hairy leaves to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of slender, elongated seed pods.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological studies due to its genetic similarity to the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana.</p>
