                <h1>Achimenes biernannii</h1>
<p>Achimenes biernannii, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular, orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and a bushy growth habit, making it an attractive addition to gardens. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Achimenes biernannii is often grown as a container plant due to its sensitivity to frost and its need for a warm, humid environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes biernannii has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a vibrant green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that grows upright. Its flowers are showy, tubular-shaped, and come in shades of pink and red, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes biernannii is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Amapá, where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within the dense rainforest canopy. It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soil along riverbanks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity of the Amazon basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes biernannii was mainly introduced to gardens and cultivated collections in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in greenhouses and as a houseplant in areas where it does not occur naturally. The plant is known for its showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. It prefers warm temperatures and bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is not widely cultivated in the wild and remains a relatively rare species in natural habitats.</p>
