<p>Aspidium albicaule, commonly known as the white-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Aspidium albicaule plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
