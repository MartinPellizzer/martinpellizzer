<p>Arachniodes yasu-inouei, commonly known as the Japanese spider fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, hence its common name. Native to Japan, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a line along the margins of the fronds.</p>
