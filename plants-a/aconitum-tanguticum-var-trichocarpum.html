                    <h1>Aconitum tanguticum var. trichocarpum</h1>
<p>Aconitum tanguticum var. trichocarpum, commonly known as the Tibetan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the Aconitum genus. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
