<p>Acanthophyllum fontanesii subsp.</p>
<p>schugnanicum, commonly known as the Schugnan sandthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, often inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, demonstrating high adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its structure helps it retain moisture and protect against wind erosion.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and is of interest for its ecological and potential medicinal values.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum fontanesii subsp.</p>
<p>schugnanicum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically Kazakhstan and southern regions of Russia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including low precipitation and extreme temperature fluctuations. It is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum fontanesii subsp.</p>
<p>schugnanicum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and southern Russia. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, its introduction to new areas may have ecological implications due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
