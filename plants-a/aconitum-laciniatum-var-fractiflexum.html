<p>Aconitum laciniatum var. fractiflexum, commonly known as the fragrant aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of tall, slender stems. The plant has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>
