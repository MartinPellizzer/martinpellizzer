                <h1>Aechmea campanulata</h1>
<p>Aechmea campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful, bell-shaped inflorescences that range from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Aechmea campanulata is popular as a decorative plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea campanulata has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, leathery, and dark green, arranged in a tight spiral at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick, and fibrous caudex that serves as a storage organ. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of white or pale blue flowers, which bloom in the summer months and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its native habitat.</p>
