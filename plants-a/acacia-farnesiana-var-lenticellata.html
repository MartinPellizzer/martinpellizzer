                <h1>Acacia farnesiana var. lenticellata</h1>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. lenticellata, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, often multi-branched stems with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a sweet, honey-like fragrance when broken. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for Mediterranean and arid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. lenticellata has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are typically green and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are yellow and arranged in globular clusters, with a structure that includes small, tubular flowers surrounded by petal-like bracts; they bloom in the spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. lenticellata is a variant of the common screwpod tree, originally native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including parts of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia, often as an introduced species. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as coastal areas, rocky soils, and disturbed landscapes. This plant typically grows at low altitudes, often below 500 meters, and is adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread presence, it is not considered a conservation concern due to its hardy nature and ability to spread easily in new environments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. lenticellata is a hardy, fast-growing shrub known for its fragrant foliage and unique bark.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it ideal for quick landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage flowering are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or rosemary can help deter pests and enhance the garden's fragrance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
