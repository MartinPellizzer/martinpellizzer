                <h1>Aeginetia multiflora</h1>
<p>Aeginetia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered aeginetia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aeginetia multiflora is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia multiflora has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
