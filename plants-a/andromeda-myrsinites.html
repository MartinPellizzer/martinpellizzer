                    <h1>Andromeda myrsinites</h1>
<p>Andromeda myrsinites, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for birds. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant's aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in acidic soils make it a valuable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
