                <h1>Aciotis cordata</h1>
<p>Aciotis cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Aciotis cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis cordata has leaves that are heart-shaped (cordate), arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, moderately hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis cordata is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country. This plant thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. It is an important component of the local flora in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific microhabitats within Peru.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis cordata was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. The plant has been introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blue and purple flowers. It has also been reported in some parts of the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited and it is not considered an invasive species in these areas.</p>
