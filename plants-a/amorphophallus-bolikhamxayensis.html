<p>Amorphophallus bolikhamxayensis, commonly known as the Bolikhamxay arrowhead, is a rare member of the Araceae family native to Laos.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves and a solitary, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a large, fleshy tuber that serves as its primary storage organ. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
