<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant possesses hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
