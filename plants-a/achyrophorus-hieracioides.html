                <h1>Achyrophorus hieracioides</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus hieracioides, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is usually unbranched and somewhat hairy. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily by wind.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus hieracioides has small, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and range in color from light green to grayish-green.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in dry, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus hieracioides is primarily native to the eastern and central regions of North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with dry, sunny environments. Its distribution extends from New England southward through the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is also present in some areas of eastern Canada, including Ontario and Quebec.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus hieracioides was mainly introduced to control weeds in agricultural fields and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated areas. This plant has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats that suppress other vegetation. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a low-impact invasive species with limited ecological effects.</p>
