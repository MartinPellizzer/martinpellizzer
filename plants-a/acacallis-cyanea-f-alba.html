                        <h1>Acacallis cyanea f. alba</h1>
<p>Acacallis cyanea f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered acacallis, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>This variant of Acacallis cyanea is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, which contrast sharply with the typical blue or violet hues of the species. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacallis cyanea f. alba is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. It is commonly observed in areas with a Mediterranean climate characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes coastal dunes and open shrublands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacallis cyanea f. alba was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers. The introduction occurred in the 19th century during the colonial period. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is primarily found in garden settings.</p>
