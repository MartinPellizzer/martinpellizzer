                    <h1>Acacallis cyanea f. alba</h1>
<p>Acacallis cyanea f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered acacallis, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>This variant of Acacallis cyanea is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, which contrast sharply with the typical blue or violet hues of the species. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
