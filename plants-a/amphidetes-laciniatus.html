                    <h1>Amphidetes laciniatus</h1>
<p>Amphidetes laciniatus, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
