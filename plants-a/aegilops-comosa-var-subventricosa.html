                    <h1>Aegilops comosa var. subventricosa</h1>
<p>Aegilops comosa var. subventricosa, commonly known as the woolly goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, glabrous leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, with lemmas that are often pubescent. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in studies related to grassland ecology and genetic diversity.</p>
