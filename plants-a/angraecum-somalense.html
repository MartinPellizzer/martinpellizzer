                    <h1>Angraecum somalense</h1>
<p>Angraecum somalense, commonly known as the Somalian orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the arid regions of Somalia and southern Arabia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Angraecum somalense is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, making it a resilient species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections.</p>
