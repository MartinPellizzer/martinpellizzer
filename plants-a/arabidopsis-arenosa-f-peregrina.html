                    <h1>Arabidopsis arenosa f. peregrina</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis arenosa f. peregrina, commonly known as the wandering Arabidopsis, is a rare and highly variable subspecies native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its morphology exhibits a wide range of leaf shapes and sizes, making it a subject of interest in evolutionary botany.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic diversity, it is considered a valuable model for studying plant adaptation and speciation.</p>
