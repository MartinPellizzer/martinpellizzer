                        <h1>Acacia orthotricha</h1>
<p>Acacia orthotricha, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in globular clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds.</p>
<p>The wood of Acacia orthotricha is hard and durable, making it useful for timber and fuel.</p>

<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of secondary cell walls and complex life cycles involving alternation of generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns, horsetails, and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and often ancient evolutionary origins. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinct structure, including legumes. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a group of flowering plants commonly known as wattles, which are widespread in Australia and characterized by their phyllodes and often yellow flowers.</p>
