                <h1>Adesmia micrantha</h1>
<p>Adesmia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered legume, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Adesmia micrantha is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia micrantha has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia micrantha is primarily native to Chile North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Chile, particularly in the Andean foothills and coastal areas. This plant thrives in dry, temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly observed in shrublands and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within northern Chile.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia micrantha was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, grasslands, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Central and South America. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and seed dispersal through livestock grazing.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
