<p>Agropyron caesium proles koeleri, commonly known as the Koeler's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and nutritional value, it is sometimes used in forage and as a soil stabilizer in restoration projects.</p>
