                        <h1>Acalypha pygmaea</h1>
<p>Acalypha pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf copperleaf, is a small shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, copper-colored leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Acalypha pygmaea is valued for its ornamental foliage and is popular in horticulture for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha pygmaea belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and subtropical species, often with unique floral structures. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," often characterized by their showy bracts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha pygmaea, a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions, known for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pygmaea is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in various habitats across the island, including dry forests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. It is a small shrub that typically reaches a height of less than one meter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Cuba.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pygmaea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in forest margins and along stream banks. Although not widely invasive, it has the potential to spread in suitable habitats if left unchecked.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the role of horticultural trade in the dispersal of non-native species.</p>
