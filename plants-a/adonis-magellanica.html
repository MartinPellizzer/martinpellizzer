<p>Adonis magellanica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis magellanica has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern.
