                <h1>Acinodendron dodecandrum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron dodecandrum, commonly known as the twelve-branched acacia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron dodecandrum has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron dodecandrum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high levels of rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in forest edges or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Philippines and Sumatra.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron dodecandrum was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia and parts of Oceania due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been reported in countries such as Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines, where it thrives in tropical climates. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping because of its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its spread is closely monitored to prevent ecological disruption in non-native regions.</p>
