                    <h1>Astragalus nevadensis</h1>
<p>Astragalus nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, arid environments such as mountain slopes and open grasslands. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Astragalus nevadensis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
