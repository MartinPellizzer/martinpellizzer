                <h1>Adinandra brefeldii</h1>
<p>Adinandra brefeldii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptic-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra brefeldii has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra brefeldii is primarily native to Sulawesi.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the mountainous regions of the island. Adinandra brefeldii is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats on Sulawesi, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra brefeldii was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and greenhouses. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its attractive foliage and small, fragrant flowers. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and lack of widespread naturalization.</p>
