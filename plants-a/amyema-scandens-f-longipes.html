                    <h1>Amyema scandens f. longipes</h1>
<p>Amyema scandens f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its growth habit is vine-like, allowing it to spread along the canopy of its host.</p>
<p>This form of Amyema is particularly adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of northeastern Australia.</p>
