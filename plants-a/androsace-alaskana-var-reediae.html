                    <h1>Androsace alaskana var. reediae</h1>
<p>Androsace alaskana var. reediae, commonly known as the Alaska sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine and arctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cymes and attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
