                <h1>Actinodium cunninghamii</h1>
<p>Actinodium cunninghamii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed actinodium, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, white flowers in clusters. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is often found in heathlands and woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodium cunninghamii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a relatively small size, typically less than 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an erect shrub. The flowers are small, white to pale green, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodium cunninghamii is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This plant is commonly associated with coastal and inland heathlands. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodium cunninghamii was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and open habitats, such as heathlands and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern states of Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for disturbed or degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
