<p>It is commonly found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of these regions. It is often seen growing in open areas with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon mirandum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
