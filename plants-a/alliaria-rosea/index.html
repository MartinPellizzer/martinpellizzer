                            <h1>Alliaria Rosea</h1>
<p>Alliaria rosea, commonly known as the heart's-ease or lungwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
