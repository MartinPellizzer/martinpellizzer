<p>Astrophytum asterias var. nudum, commonly known as the naked star cactus, is a unique cactus native to the desert regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and the absence of spines, giving it a smooth, almost glass-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to thrive in well-draining, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens.</p>
