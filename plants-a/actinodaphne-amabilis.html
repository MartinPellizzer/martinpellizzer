<p>Actinodaphne amabilis, commonly known as the fragrant laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, reddish-brown berries. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne amabilis has elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth texture and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects.
