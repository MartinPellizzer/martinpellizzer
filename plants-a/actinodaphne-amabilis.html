<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Thailand, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, smooth drupe that matures to a dark purple color, containing a single seed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne amabilis has simple, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with yellowish-green petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when ripe, dispersing seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne amabilis is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo, specifically found in the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented forest areas within these regions, where it thrives in lowland and hill forests. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typically growing at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters. Due to habitat loss from deforestation and land conversion, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne amabilis is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and fragrant leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with steady growth in warm, humid conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy development. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like pandanus or cycads can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>
