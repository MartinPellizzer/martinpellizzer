                <h1>Adenostegia bolanderi</h1>
<p>Adenostegia bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's adenostegia, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Adenostegia bolanderi is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia bolanderi has small, narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to reddish-brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when the pod splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia bolanderi is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is particularly associated with serpentine soils, which are nutrient-poor and often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Adenostegia bolanderi is a rare and endemic species, with limited distribution along the California coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia bolanderi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and disturbed forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. Its introduction has led to its establishment in non-native regions, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in disturbed areas, making it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
