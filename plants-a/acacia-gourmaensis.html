<p>Acacia gourmaensis, commonly known as the Gourma acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically shed during the dry season. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia gourmaensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert animals.</p>
