                <h1>Achillea nanoides</h1>
<p>Achillea nanoides, commonly known as small yarrow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ecological and ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nanoides has small, basal leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green, and densely arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, and it grows from the base of the plant. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads with ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nanoides is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open habitats like slopes, cliffs, and along roadsides. This plant is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions typical of its native range. It is often seen growing in mountainous areas and is part of the broader Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, making it a characteristic plant of its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nanoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, small yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can form dense stands in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
