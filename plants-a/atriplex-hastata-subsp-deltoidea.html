<p>Atriplex hastata subsp.</p>
<p>deltoidea, commonly known as the delta saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
