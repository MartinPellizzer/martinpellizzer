                    <h1>Arenaria flexuosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria flexuosa, commonly known as the bent sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Arenaria flexuosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
