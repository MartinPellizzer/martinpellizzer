<p>Cinnamon fern, scientifically known as Asplenium scolopendrium var. americanum, is a striking evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is named for its cinnamon-colored fiddleheads that unfurl in the spring, adding a unique visual appeal to woodland gardens. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its feathery fronds can reach several feet in height, creating a lush, dramatic presence in the landscape. Despite its delicate appearance, the cinnamon fern is hardy and adaptable, making it a popular choice for native plant enthusiasts.</p>
