                    <h1>Astragalus rugosus var. pilosus</h1>
<p>Astragalus rugosus var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Astragalus rugosus var. pilosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
