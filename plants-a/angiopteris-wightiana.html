<p>Angiopteris wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
