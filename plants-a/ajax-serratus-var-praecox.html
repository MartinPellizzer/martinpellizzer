                    <h1>Ajax serratus var. praecox</h1>
<p>Ajax serratus var. praecox, commonly known as the early serrated ajax, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow ray florets that contrast with its dark green foliage. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
