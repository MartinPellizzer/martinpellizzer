                <h1>Adromischus schonlandii</h1>
<p>Adromischus schonlandii, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water.</p>
<p>Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus schonlandii has thick, fleshy leaves that are broadly ovate to nearly round, typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that ranges from green to reddish pink, depending on light exposure.</p>
<p>The stems are short and stout, with a smooth, pale green to bluish-gray bark, growing upright with a compact, shrub-like form. It produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature, and the plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus schonlandii is primarily native to the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and coastal areas within this region. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area. It is often seen growing in sandy or gravelly habitats along the coast.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions in South Africa, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus schonlandii was mainly introduced to regions with arid and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky outcrops, preferring full sun exposure. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its compact growth and attractive, fleshy leaves. It is particularly suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interest and its ability to adapt to drought conditions.</p>
