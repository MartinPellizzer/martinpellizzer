                    <h1>Adenium somalense var. caudatipetalum</h1>
<p>Adenium somalense var. caudatipetalum, commonly known as the Somali adenium or the desert candle, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and robust, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its toxic sap, which contains cardioactive compounds used in traditional medicine.</p>
