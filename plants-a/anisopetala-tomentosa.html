<p>Anisopetala tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly anisopetala, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Anisopetala tomentosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
