                    <h1>Asclepias cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Asclepias cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Asclepias cuneifolia is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping in arid environments.</p>
