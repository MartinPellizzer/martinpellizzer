                <h1>Aconitum pomeense</h1>
<p>Aconitum pomeense, commonly known as the Pomegranate Aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense racemes. Its leaves are compound, with deeply lobed foliage that resembles that of a fern.</p>
<p>Aconitum pomeense is known for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pomeense has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with a deep green color and a velvety texture; the leaves are typically 10-20 cm in length and have serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in a spike, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pomeense is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the high-altitude regions of this area. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats. The species is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific locations within Tibet.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pomeense was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal and can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
