                <h1>Adenia cladosepala</h1>
<p>Adenia cladosepala, commonly known as the clustered adenium, is a striking plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a unique growth habit, often forming dense clusters of stems that give it its common name. Its leaves are typically large and leathery, adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Adenia cladosepala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia cladosepala has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically brownish-gray in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a white to pale pink color, featuring five petals and stamens; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia cladosepala is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the island, particularly in humid lowland forests. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is often seen growing in secondary vegetation and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Madagascar's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia cladosepala was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Passifloraceae family and is native to Australia. The plant was introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas throughout the country.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
