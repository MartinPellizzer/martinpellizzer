                <h1>Acourtia arachnolepis</h1>
<p>Acourtia arachnolepis, commonly known as the spider-hair acourtia, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb with hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its unique name comes from the hairy, spider-like structures on its stems.</p>
<p>Acourtia arachnolepis is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia arachnolepis has small, hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a pale greenish-brown bark that is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia arachnolepis is primarily native to the coastal regions of central and southern California, as well as parts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates. This plant is commonly found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it can tolerate salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its distribution has become increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia arachnolepis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes, roadsides, and other disturbed environments where it can establish itself quickly. The plant thrives in full sun and has a high tolerance for saline and alkaline conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
