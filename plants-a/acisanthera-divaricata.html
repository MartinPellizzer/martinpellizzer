                <h1>Acisanthera divaricata</h1>
<p>Acisanthera divaricata, commonly known as the variable acacia, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Acisanthera divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera divaricata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, and bloom during the spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera divaricata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland forests and secondary vegetation. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, typically in areas with high rainfall. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned farmland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera divaricata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and distinctive foliage. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun conditions. It has since become established in wetland areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
