                    <h1>Alchemilla semisecta</h1>
<p>Alchemilla semisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
