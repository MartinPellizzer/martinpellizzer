<p>Asplenium cavalerianum, commonly known as the Cavalerian's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Asplenium cavalerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
