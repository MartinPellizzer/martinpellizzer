                <h1>Acronia marthae</h1>
<p>Acronia marthae, commonly known as the Martha's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Acronia marthae is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia marthae has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia marthae is primarily native to the southern Appalachian Mountains in the United States.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. It is often associated with rich, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Acronia marthae is a rare and endemic species, with a limited geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia marthae was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and inland regions with mild, temperate climates. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its adaptability. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in these areas.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
