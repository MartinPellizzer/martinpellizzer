<p>Aulomyrcia atrovirens, commonly known as the black-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It primarily grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Myrsine, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that are adapted for bird dispersal. Its leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Aulomyrcia atrovirens is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
