                    <h1>Adonis vernalis var. praecox</h1>
<p>Adonis vernalis var. praecox, commonly known as the early spring adonis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its early blooming habit, it is an important early nectar source for pollinators.</p>
