                <h1>Actaea caudata</h1>
<p>Actaea caudata, commonly known as red baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiny, red berries that appear in late summer. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive notched appearance and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea caudata has palmately compound leaves that are typically 10–20 cm in length, with 5–7 lance-shaped leaflets arranged radiating from a single point, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and reddish-brown, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are white and arranged in an upright raceme, with each flower having five petal-like sepals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate composed of many small achenes, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in shaded, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea caudata is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests and thickets. This species thrives in shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its range extends from the northeastern United States down to the southeastern regions.</p>
<p>It is particularly common in the Appalachian Mountains and the Midwest.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea caudata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states including Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The plant is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its introduction is likely due to horticultural interests and accidental spread.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas.</p>
