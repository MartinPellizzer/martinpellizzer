                    <h1>Acer amplum var. convexum</h1>
<p>Acer amplum var. convexum, commonly known as the convex-leaf maple, is a variant of the European maple characterized by its distinctive, thickened, and often warty leaf margins.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, with a rough, textured surface that distinguishes it from other maple species.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
