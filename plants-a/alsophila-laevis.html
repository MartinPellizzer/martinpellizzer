<p>Alsophila laevis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller, finger-like segments, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
