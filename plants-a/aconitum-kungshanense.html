                <h1>Aconitum kungshanense</h1>
<p>Aconitum kungshanense, commonly known as the Kungshan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy. Aconitum kungshanense is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a dangerous plant to handle.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum kungshanense has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred petal, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the rocky soils of its mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum kungshanense is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of this area, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is commonly found in forested areas and rocky slopes, often in regions with high humidity. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is limited to specific elevations in southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum kungshanense was mainly introduced to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for high-altitude habitats. This species is often found in forested areas and rocky slopes, where it benefits from partial shade and cooler temperatures. Its introduction to these regions has been driven by its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
