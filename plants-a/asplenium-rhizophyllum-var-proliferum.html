<p>Asplenium rhizophyllum var. proliferum, commonly known as the creeping wood spleenwort, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the soil surface. The fronds are usually short and broad, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through the proliferation of its rhizomes, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
