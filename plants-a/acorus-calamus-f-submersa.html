                    <h1>Acorus calamus f. submersa</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged sweet flag, is a variant of the sweet flag plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the aerial forms of the species. This plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
