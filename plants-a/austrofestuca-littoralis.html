                    <h1>Austrofestuca littoralis</h1>
<p>Austrofestuca littoralis, commonly known as the coastal grass or littoral grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, estuaries, and coastal dunes. Austrofestuca littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked but contribute to the ecological diversity of coastal habitats.</p>
