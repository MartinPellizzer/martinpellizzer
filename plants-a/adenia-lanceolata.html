                <h1>Adenia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Adenia lanceolata, commonly known as the African mountain balm, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, red or orange fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Adenia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia lanceolata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually glossy green, with a slightly serrated margin and a petiole that is often hairy.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically a dark brown or greyish color. The flowers are large, showy, and consist of a spurred corona with five petals, displaying a vibrant yellow to orange color, and they bloom in late winter to early spring, pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia lanceolata is primarily native to Kenya, Malawi, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in forested areas and along riverbanks. Adenia lanceolata is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and montane habitats across its distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia lanceolata was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture during its growing season. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering structure. It has been successfully introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and the need for careful cultivation.</p>
