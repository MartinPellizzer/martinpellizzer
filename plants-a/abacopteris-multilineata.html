                    <h1>Abacopteris multilineata</h1>
<p>Abacopteris multilineata, commonly known as the multilined orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, multi-layered petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its small, fragrant flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Abacopteris multilineata is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
