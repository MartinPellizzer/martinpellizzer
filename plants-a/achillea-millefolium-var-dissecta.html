                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. dissecta, commonly known as the fern-leaved yarrow, is a variant of the common yarrow plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads composed of small white to pale yellow florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. dissecta has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are narrow and deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. dissecta is a variant of the common yarrow, native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and the Carpathians.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and some regions of Russia. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its specific populations may be vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. dissecta is a striking perennial known for its finely cut, fern-like foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower heads to encourage rebloom and maintain shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with lavender, yarrow, and sedum in garden beds.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. dissecta is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing well alongside other herbs and flowering plants in mixed gardens. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
