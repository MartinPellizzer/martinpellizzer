                    <h1>Arceuthobium occidentale</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium occidentale, commonly known as the western dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. These seeds are dispersed when the berries are shaken by wind or animals, allowing the plant to colonize new hosts.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an important ecological component in forest ecosystems.</p>
