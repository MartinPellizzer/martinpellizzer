                    <h1>Alisma submersum var. graminifolium</h1>
<p>Alisma submersum var. graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or wetland environments, with its rhizomes submerged in the soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its small white flowers appear in clusters above the water, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slender foliage and is often found in marshy areas alongside other aquatic plants.</p>
