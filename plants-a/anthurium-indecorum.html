<p>Anthurium indecorum, commonly known as the "Red Anthurium," is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a reddish tint. The plant produces striking spadices, which are spathes that enclose the true flowers, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium indecorum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to purify indoor air.</p>
