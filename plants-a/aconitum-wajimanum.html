                <h1>Aconitum wajimanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum wajimanum, commonly known as the Wajima aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Like other members of the aconite genus, it contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals.</p>

<p>Aconitum wajimanum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a rough texture and a prominent central vein.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and cylindrical, with a dark brown bark that becomes rough as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in racemes, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>
