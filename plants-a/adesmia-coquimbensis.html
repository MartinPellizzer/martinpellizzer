                <h1>Adesmia coquimbensis</h1>
<p>Adesmia coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant is shrub-like, with fleshy, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves. It produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>Adesmia coquimbensis is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia coquimbensis has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, featuring white or pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia coquimbensis is primarily native to Chile Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the central regions of Chile, particularly in the semi-arid and arid areas. It thrives in coastal and inland desert environments, adapting to the harsh climate of the region. Adesmia coquimbensis is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky terrain.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Chile Central, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia coquimbensis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it resilient in harsh environments. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and climate change.</p>
