<p>Asclepias vicaria, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often branched.</p>
<p>Asclepias vicaria plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
