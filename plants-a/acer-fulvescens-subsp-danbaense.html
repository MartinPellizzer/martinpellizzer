                <h1>Acer fulvescens subsp. danbaense</h1>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>danbaense, commonly known as the Danba maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with 5 to 7 lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>danbaense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip; they are usually bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin flakes, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens; they bloom in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>danbaense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Vietnam and Laos. Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within these countries, where it grows in moist, shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in humid temperate climates, typically found in dense evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>danbaense is a rare and ornamental maple species native to parts of East Asia, known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique growth habits. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic value and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>danbaense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>This species acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting other plant life. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling, improving soil fertility through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>danbaense is a lesser-known species of maple native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in regions like Vietnam and Laos. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have potential for local food uses.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been explored for its possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The tree's wood is valued for its durability, making it useful in industrial applications such as furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local communities, though its role in cultural practices is not well documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>danbaense has several varieties that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability to different climates. Popular cultivars include 'Korean Red' and 'Red Dragon,' known for their vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>This species has also been used in hybridization efforts to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and color retention. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions and its contribution to landscape diversity.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and resilience, it remains a sought-after plant in both public and private gardens.</p>
