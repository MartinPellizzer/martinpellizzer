                <h1>Adenophora collina</h1>
<p>Adenophora collina, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well.</p>
<p>Adenophora collina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora collina has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are generally hairy and range in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a light green to reddish-brown color and an upright growth pattern. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in cymes, and are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora collina is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and riverbanks. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous soils. Its range extends from southern Canada down through the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Adenophora collina is an important part of the native flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora collina was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant is now considered a potential weed in some areas, particularly in the North Island, where it can compete with native species. Its distribution is largely limited to disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and forest margins.</p>
<p>Despite its introduced status, it remains popular among gardeners for its aesthetic value.</p>
