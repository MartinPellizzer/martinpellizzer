                <h1>Adhatoda nilgherrica</h1>
<p>Adhatoda nilgherrica, commonly known as Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring aromatic leaves and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties, used in traditional medicine for its antispasmodic and bronchodilator effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda nilgherrica has elliptical or ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length and 2-4 cm in width.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that is slightly fibrous in texture, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in panicles, with a pale blue or violet color, blooming during the summer months, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda nilgherrica is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly in regions of India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly distributed in the southern and eastern parts of India, including states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Assam.
