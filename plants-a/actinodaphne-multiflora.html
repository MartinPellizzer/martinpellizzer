                <h1>Actinodaphne multiflora</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic evergreen leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed, and it often grows in lowland forests.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Actinodaphne multiflora make it an important component of tropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne multiflora has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe with a single seed, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne multiflora is primarily native to Fiji and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and in lowland forests. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific island groups in the South Pacific.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne multiflora was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasive nature.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its fragrant leaves and aesthetic appeal.</p>
