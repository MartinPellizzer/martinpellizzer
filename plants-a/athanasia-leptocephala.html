                    <h1>Athanasia leptocephala</h1>
<p>Athanasia leptocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many toxic species, and it is characterized by its basal leaves with deeply lobed margins. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, and it is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>
