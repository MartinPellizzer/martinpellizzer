                    <h1>Alchornea glandulosa</h1>
<p>Alchornea glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf or glandular alchornea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
