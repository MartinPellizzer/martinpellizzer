<p>Asplenium meanum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, preferring moist and well-drained soils. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, silvery down. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium meanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
