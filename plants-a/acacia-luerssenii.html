                    <h1>Acacia luerssenii</h1>
<p>Acacia luerssenii, commonly known as the LÃ¼rsenii acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, a common adaptation in acacia species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>The tree is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
