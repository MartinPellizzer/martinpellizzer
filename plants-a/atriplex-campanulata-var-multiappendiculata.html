                    <h1>Atriplex campanulata var. multiappendiculata</h1>
<p>Atriplex campanulata var. multiappendiculata, commonly known as the clustered saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland salt flats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
