                <h1>Acacia impressa</h1>
<p>Acacia impressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are narrow and leathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during spring, which are followed by elongated, woody pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Acacia impressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia impressa has compound leaves that are phyllary, with a pinnate arrangement, small leaflets, and a generally green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in strips as the plant matures. The flowers are yellow and consist of a single globular head made up of many small, clustered flowers, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, allowing the plant to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
