                <h1>Acer campestre f. compactum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. compactum, commonly known as the dwarf horse chestnut, is a compact form of the European horse chestnut.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces showy white flowers in early spring, followed by spiny capsules containing chestnuts. Its foliage is typically dark green and turns red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is well-suited for small gardens and urban landscapes due to its size and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. compactum has small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring 2-5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern due to its compact form. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-green sepals and no petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. compactum is a compact form of the European mountain ash, native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and parts of Germany. It thrives in open, sunny environments like meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. compactum is a compact, slow-growing ornamental maple known for its dense foliage and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant follows a typical deciduous growth cycle, shedding leaves in autumn and regrowing them in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
