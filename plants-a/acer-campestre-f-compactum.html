                        <h1>Acer campestre f. compactum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. compactum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, rounded foliage with palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and seasonal color changes.</p>
