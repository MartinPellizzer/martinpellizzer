<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>depilata, commonly known as the coastal thrift or sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has succulent, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
