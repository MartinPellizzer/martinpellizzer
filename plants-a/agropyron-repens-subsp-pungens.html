<p>Agropyron repens subsp.</p>
<p>pungens, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
