                    <h1>Agropyron nubigenum</h1>
<p>Agropyron nubigenum, commonly known as the alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron nubigenum is often found in high-altitude meadows and is well-suited for erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh climates makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
