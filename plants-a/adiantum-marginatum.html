                <h1>Adiantum marginatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum marginatum, commonly known as the Maidenhair Fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum marginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum marginatum has delicate, finely divided leaves that are usually triangular in shape, arranged pinnately along the stem, and range in size from 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically a vibrant green with a silvery margin, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores through wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum marginatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forests and near water sources. This fern is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical regions, where it grows on rocky surfaces or in moist soil. Its distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in mountainous areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the Pacific Islands and parts of Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum marginatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant is often associated with disturbed or riparian habitats due to its adaptability. Although it is not considered invasive, it can spread readily through its spore production.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
