<p>Agropyron mutabile var. pilosum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it is often found in alpine meadows and used in restoration projects.</p>
