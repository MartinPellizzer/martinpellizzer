                <h1>Achillea septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Achillea septentrionalis, commonly known as northern yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea septentrionalis has basal, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea septentrionalis is primarily native to the northern regions of North America, particularly in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, dry, and rocky habitats such as grasslands, prairies, and disturbed soils. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with areas that have well-drained soil. Its distribution includes parts of the Great Plains and the western United States.</p>
<p>It is an important component of native plant communities in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea septentrionalis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in open fields.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
