<p>Anthemis cotula var. cotula, commonly known as common ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves contain pyrethrin, a natural insecticide, which has historically been used in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can pose a risk to livestock due to its toxic properties.</p>
