                <h1>Aconitum tongolense</h1>
<p>Aconitum tongolense, commonly known as the Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum tongolense is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tongolense has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a somewhat waxy appearance.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and usually has a grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, typically blooming in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a fleshy, sticky appendage, aiding in seed dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tongolense is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. It thrives in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. The species is commonly found in forested regions and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tongolense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas along streambanks and in forest understories. The plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature. It was first documented in Washington State in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental seed dispersal via human activity.</p>
