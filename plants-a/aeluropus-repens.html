                <h1>Aeluropus repens</h1>
<p>Aeluropus repens, commonly known as sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Aeluropus repens plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus repens has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and typically linear in shape, with a blue-green color and a flat, blade-like structure.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is low-growing, prostrate, and often forms dense mats. The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light green color, and it spreads horizontally along the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually pink or purple, blooming in the spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled capsule that releases seeds through dryness, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant thrive in sandy or saline soils.</p>
