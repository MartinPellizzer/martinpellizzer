<p>Aeluropus repens, commonly known as sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Aeluropus repens plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>
