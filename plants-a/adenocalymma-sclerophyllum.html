                <h1>Adenocalymma sclerophyllum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma sclerophyllum, commonly known as the rock heath, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in rocky soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma sclerophyllum is often found in rocky outcrops and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sclerophyllum has leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is grey to brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sclerophyllum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the region of the Cape Floristic Region, which is known for its high biodiversity. This plant thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often growing on cliffs or among granite outcrops. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area, characterized by wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma sclerophyllum is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sclerophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant thrives in environments where it can receive ample sunlight and has good drainage. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes in gardens and public spaces.</p>
