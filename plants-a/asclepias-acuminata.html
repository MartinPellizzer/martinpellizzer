<p>Asclepias acuminata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its latex sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Asclepias acuminata plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a food source for their larvae.</p>
