                    <h1>Agrostis delicatula</h1>
<p>Agrostis delicatula, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along riverbanks and in meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Agrostis delicatula is also valued as a forage plant for livestock due to its nutritional content and hardiness.</p>
