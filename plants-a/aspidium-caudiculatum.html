<p>Aspidium caudiculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>Aspidium caudiculatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for various small organisms.</p>
