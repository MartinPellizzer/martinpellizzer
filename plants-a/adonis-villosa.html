                <h1>Adonis villosa</h1>
<p>Adonis villosa, commonly known as the hairy adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it often grows in rocky or alpine habitats. Adonis villosa produces small, yellowish-orange flowers with numerous stamens, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis villosa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of short hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody with a grayish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a dark purple center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis villosa is primarily native to Altay, Kazakhstan, and West Siberia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is commonly associated with rocky and gravelly soils in these regions. The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations in Central Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis villosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fluffy seed heads. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plant species. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in open fields.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
