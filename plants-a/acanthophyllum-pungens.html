                        <h1>Acanthophyllum pungens</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum pungens, commonly known as the spiny saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and thick, waxy cuticles on its foliage.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
