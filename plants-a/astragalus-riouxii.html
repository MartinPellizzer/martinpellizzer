                    <h1>Astragalus riouxii</h1>
<p>Astragalus riouxii, commonly known as the Rioux's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus riouxii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance is notable in its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
