                <h1>Aellenia auricula</h1>
<p>Aellenia auricula, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Aellenia auricula is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aellenia auricula has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
