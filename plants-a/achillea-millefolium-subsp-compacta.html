                <h1>Achillea millefolium subsp. compacta</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>compacta, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North America. It features a compact growth habit with upright, branched stems and finely divided, feathery leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads in shades of white, pink, or yellow. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its medicinal and ornamental uses have made it a valued plant in both traditional and modern horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>compacta has leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a silver-gray color and a soft, velvety texture. The stems are upright, somewhat hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>compacta is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and western Asia. Its current distribution includes introduced populations in North America, especially in the western United States, where it has been cultivated or escaped from cultivation.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, sunny grasslands, rocky soils, and open woodlands, often in well-drained environments. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level. The conservation status of Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>compacta is generally stable, though local populations may be threatened by habitat loss and urban development.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>compacta is a compact, hardy perennial known for its finely divided foliage and bright yellow flowers. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, with active growth emerging in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower heads to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>compacta is a low-growing perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant yellow flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can help in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting other plant life in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>compacta is a lesser-known variant of yarrow, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens due to its compact growth and delicate foliage. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it shares some of the medicinal properties of its relatives, such as anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>In industrial and economic contexts, it has limited use compared to other members of the Asteraceae family, though it may contribute to ecological landscaping. Culturally, it lacks the symbolic significance of the common yarrow, but it is sometimes used in herbal teas and traditional remedies.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains in horticulture and minor medicinal practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>compacta has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea' and 'Paprika', which are prized for their compact growth and vibrant foliage colors. It also produces hybrids with other achillea species, enhancing its adaptability and ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>These varieties are widely used in horticulture for their hardiness, drought tolerance, and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. Their attractive foliage and extended flowering period make them valuable additions to rock gardens and borders. Overall, Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>compacta plays an important role in modern landscaping due to its versatility and aesthetic appeal.</p>
