                <h1>Acrostichum mandonii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's holly fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant features compound fronds with a distinctive, leathery texture and a dark green coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories.</p>
<p>Acrostichum mandonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mandonii has long, narrow leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure around 30â€“60 cm in length with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green to yellowish color, growing upright with a spreading habit. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mandonii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps, where it thrives in brackish or saltwater environments. This species is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as Papua New Guinea and parts of the Solomon Islands. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found near estuaries and tidal zones.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, its distribution is relatively limited compared to other fern species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mandonii was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high salinity and frequent tidal flooding. This plant is commonly found in marshes and estuaries where it forms dense stands. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
