                <h1>Acronia hammelii</h1>
<p>Acronia hammelii, commonly known as the hammel's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronia hammelii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia hammelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branched structure. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, and they bloom in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia hammelii is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically found in parts of Texas, Louisiana, and Florida.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often growing along the edges of freshwater habitats. This plant is adapted to the humid and subtropical climate of the southeastern region. It is commonly associated with cypress swamps and other moist forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia hammelii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast states. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in disturbed and urban habitats.</p>
