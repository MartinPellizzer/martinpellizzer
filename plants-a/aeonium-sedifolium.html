<p>Aeonium sedifolium, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Christ's Crown, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which emerge from the center of the rosette. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for indoor or outdoor cultivation.</p>
