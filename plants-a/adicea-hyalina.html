                <h1>Adicea hyalina</h1>
<p>Adicea hyalina, commonly known as the glassy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the flowers are small and often pale in color.</p>
<p>Adicea hyalina is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea hyalina has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a pale green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea hyalina is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and abundant water sources. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adicea hyalina is also occasionally reported in the Caribbean, but its primary range remains in the southeastern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea hyalina was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established populations in regions with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forested areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
