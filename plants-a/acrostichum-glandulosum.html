                <h1>Acrostichum glandulosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum glandulosum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glandulosum has long, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is clump-forming. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are dispersed through this mechanism.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glandulosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies where the soil remains consistently moist. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Its native distribution extends to parts of New Guinea and the islands of the western Pacific.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate brackish water conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glandulosum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, glossy leaves. The plant has since spread along riverbanks and wetlands, often establishing itself in disturbed or flooded areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
