                <h1>Aeluropus smithii</h1>
<p>Aeluropus smithii, commonly known as coastal grass or saltgrass, is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of western and central North America. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Aeluropus smithii is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it a key component of salt marsh and beach ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus smithii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear, arranged in two rows along the stem, and range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a smooth texture, growing in dense clusters or tufts. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, with a greenish or pale yellow color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, three-angled achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant thrive in coastal and saline environments.</p>
