                <h1>Adiantum festum</h1>
<p>Adiantum festum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive U-shaped sori on the underside.</p>
<p>Adiantum festum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum festum has delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a feather-like structure, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, and typically measuring 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green and remain fresh and leathery throughout the growing season. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cluster of small, dry berries that release tiny seeds through mechanical means, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum festum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and stream sides. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rocky or clayey soils. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with consistent rainfall and mild temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum festum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
