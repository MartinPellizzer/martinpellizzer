                <h1>Acinos subcrispus</h1>
<p>Acinos subcrispus, commonly known as the curlyleaf acino, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a crinkled or curly appearance, giving it its common name. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, dry fruits called achene.</p>
<p>Acinos subcrispus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos subcrispus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a silvery-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry environments by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos subcrispus is primarily native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Utah. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often in mountainous or desert environments. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can be found in open habitats like grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos subcrispus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high elevations and a temperate climate. This plant is often found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
