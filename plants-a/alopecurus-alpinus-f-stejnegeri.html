                    <h1>Alopecurus alpinus f. stejnegeri</h1>
<p>Alopecurus alpinus f. stejnegeri, commonly known as the alpine silky-grass, is a rare and specialized grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, adapted to harsh mountain environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
