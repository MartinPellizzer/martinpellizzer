                <h1>Adenocalymma foveolatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma foveolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma foveolatum is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it forms dense, hardy colonies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma foveolatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma foveolatum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This species typically grows in rocky outcrops and fynbos vegetation. It thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma foveolatum is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found on steep slopes and mountainous terrain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma foveolatum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woodlands, and sandy soils. The plant thrives in full sun and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
