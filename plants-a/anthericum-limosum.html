<p>Anthericum limosum, commonly known as the bog asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Anthericum limosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats.</p>
