                <h1>Achillea genipi</h1>
<p>Achillea genipi, commonly known as the meadow thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellowish-green to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Achillea genipi is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea genipi has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea genipi is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in Spain and France. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Achillea genipi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea genipi is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature plants, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Achillea genipi includes a dormant winter period followed by rapid growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry spells, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, and pruning of spent flower heads encourages continued blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like rosemary or thyme can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>

<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea genipi also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a diverse ecosystem in its habitat.</p>
