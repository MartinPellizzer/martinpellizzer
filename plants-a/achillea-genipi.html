                <h1>Achillea genipi</h1>
<p>Achillea genipi, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are small and white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea genipi is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea genipi has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea genipi is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, specifically found on the islands of Tenerife, La Gomera, and El Hierro.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within these islands. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as coastal cliffs and open slopes, often growing in well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea genipi is considered endangered and is under conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea genipi is a hardy perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, flowering in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea genipi is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter among its foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic compounds. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea genipi contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea genipi is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>It is used in traditional medicine to treat digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The plant also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and birds.
