                <h1>Achillea oxyodonta</h1>
<p>Achillea oxyodonta, commonly known as the narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth habits make it a hardy and low-maintenance addition to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyodonta has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and have a silver-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyodonta is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of the country, particularly in the central and western parts. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, and mountainous areas. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not commonly found outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyodonta was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadside ditches, gravelly slopes, and dry wastelands. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xerophytic environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
