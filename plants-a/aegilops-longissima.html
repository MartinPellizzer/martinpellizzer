                    <h1>Aegilops longissima</h1>
<p>Aegilops longissima, commonly known as the longç©— goatgrass, is a wild wheat relative native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender spikes and grass-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential crop improvement.</p>
