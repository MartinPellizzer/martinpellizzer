                <h1>Aegilops longissima</h1>
<p>Aegilops longissima, commonly known as the longç©— goatgrass, is a wild wheat relative native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender spikes and grass-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential crop improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops longissima has elongated, narrow leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, with a grass-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and unbranched. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets bearing small, two-lobed flowers that are pale green to yellowish in color, blooming in early summer and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, indehiscent caryopsis, with seeds dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
