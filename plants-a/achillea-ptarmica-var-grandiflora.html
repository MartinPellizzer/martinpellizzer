<p>Achillea ptarmica var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Greathead yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silver-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces large, showy flower heads composed of numerous white to pale pink florets arranged in flat, circular clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a symbol of love and devotion adds to its cultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. grandiflora has narrow, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a fuzzy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes whitish underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, growing in a clumping or spreading pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets that are bright yellow and disk florets that are pale yellow, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, aided by the feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. grandiflora is a variant of the common yarrow that is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes areas of the Mediterranean basin, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea ptarmica var. grandiflora is generally stable, though it may be locally threatened by habitat loss and overgrazing.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. grandiflora is a hardy perennial known for its showy, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds directly into the garden in late fall. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with new growth emerging in the spring and flowering throughout the summer before going dormant in the winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
