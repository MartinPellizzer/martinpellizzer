                <h1>Aconitum rectum</h1>
<p>Aconitum rectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically narrower than those of other aconite species. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant with both medicinal and dangerous properties.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum rectum has leaves that are compound, typically consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that is slightly ridged, and it grows in a straight, vertical pattern. The flowers are blue to purple, forming dense clusters at the top of the stem, and they bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees through their nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rectum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is an ornamental plant known for its striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle it with care and avoid ingestion.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rectum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, including accidental introduction via contaminated soil or machinery.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant has become established in several states, particularly in the eastern United States. Due to its toxicity, it poses a risk to both livestock and humans.</p>
<p>Its spread is often associated with disturbed habitats and increased human activity in natural areas.</p>
