                <h1>Acmena parviflora</h1>
<p>Acmena parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered acmena, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Acmena parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and delicate blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena parviflora has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a compact, bushy form. Its small, fragrant flowers are white to pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena parviflora is primarily native to eastern and northern Australia, including regions in Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of habitats such as rainforests, moist sclerophyll forests, and coastal areas. This plant is commonly found in subtropical and tropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is well adapted to the humid and warm conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Acmena parviflora is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens outside its natural distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena parviflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic qualities. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand.</p>
