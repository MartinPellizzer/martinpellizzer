                <h1>Acmena parviflora</h1>
<p>Acmena parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered acmena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in rounded inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are woody follicles that split open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Acmena parviflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in native landscaping and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena parviflora has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena parviflora is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes humid, shaded understorey environments in lowland and coastal areas. Currently, it is also found in parts of northern New South Wales and the northern territories of Papua New Guinea. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acmena parviflora is listed as critically endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmena parviflora is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 3 to 5 years, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It requires well-drained soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests naturally.</p>
