<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in terminal panicles, and bloom in spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose, fleshy drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient nutrient uptake in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena chinensis is a species of flowering plant native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and the Philippines, as a result of cultivation and natural spread. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as mountain forests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acmena chinensis is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its habitat is under threat due to deforestation and urbanization.</p>
