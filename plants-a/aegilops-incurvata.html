<p>Aegilops incurvata, commonly known as the curlleaf wild oat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aegilops incurvata is considered a weed in some areas but has also been studied for its potential in crop improvement due to its genetic relationship with wheat.</p>
