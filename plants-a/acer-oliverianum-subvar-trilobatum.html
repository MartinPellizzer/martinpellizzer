                <h1>Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum</h1>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum, commonly known as the Three-lobed maple, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum has leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning bright red in the autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth habit. The flowers are small, yellow-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to stabilize the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of North America and Europe, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. This subvariety thrives in temperate climates, typically found in moist, well-drained soils within shaded to semi-shaded environments. It grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level, often in forests or along stream sides.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum is a small, ornamental maple known for its unique trifoliate leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 10 to 15 years, and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum is a valuable native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native flora. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum is a rare and ornamental maple species primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional practices. The tree contributes to local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife, though it has limited industrial or economic significance. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in regions where it is native, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, conservation efforts are crucial to preserve its ecological and genetic role.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aconitifolium' and 'Sutherlandii', which showcase striking foliage and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>This species is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, resulting in plants with enhanced cold hardiness and foliage coloration. These hybrids are often used in horticulture to expand the range of maple trees suitable for different climates. The horticultural importance of Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum lies in its ability to contribute to the genetic diversity of ornamental maples.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a valuable addition to both gardens and botanical collections.</p>
