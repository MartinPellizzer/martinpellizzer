                    <h1>Athyrium acutum</h1>
<p>Athyrium acutum, commonly known as the narrowleaf Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
