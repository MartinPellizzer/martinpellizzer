<p>Ayenia fernandesii, commonly known as the São Tomé fern, is a rare and endemic species native to São Tomé Island in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Ayenia fernandesii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
