<p>Andropogon intrans, commonly known as grass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for erosion control.</p>
<p>Andropogon intrans is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its potential use in restoration projects.</p>
