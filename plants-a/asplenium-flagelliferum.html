<p>Asplenium flagelliferum, commonly known as the whipspore spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a pale green to brownish hue. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a linear pattern.</p>
<p>Asplenium flagelliferum is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest canopies.</p>
