                    <h1>Antiphylla pulvinata</h1>
<p>Antiphylla pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, which means it is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths that help it retain moisture and protect against harsh weather conditions. Its structure is adapted for survival in extreme climates, making it a common sight in deserts and high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>Antiphylla pulvinata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
