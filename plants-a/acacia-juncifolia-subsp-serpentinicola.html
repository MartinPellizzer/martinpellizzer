<p>Acacia juncifolia subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowers that appear in globular inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its ability to thrive in such harsh conditions makes it an important component of these unique ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of traditional medicine.</p>
