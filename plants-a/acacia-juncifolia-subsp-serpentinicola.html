                        <h1>Acacia juncifolia subsp. serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Acacia juncifolia subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowers that appear in globular inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its ability to thrive in such harsh conditions makes it an important component of these unique ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia juncifolia subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. This subspecies is commonly found in areas with sandy soils and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in association with other endemic flora. The plant is adapted to tolerate salt spray and high wind exposure typical of coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern half of the state, particularly around the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia juncifolia subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola was mainly introduced to areas with serpentine soils due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, aluminum-rich environments. It is commonly found in rocky and coastal regions where other plant species struggle to survive.</p>
<p>This subspecies has been introduced to several parts of Australia, particularly in the south-western and eastern regions. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
