<p>Alchemilla hoppeana var. floribunda, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a compact, mat-like growth habit that suppresses weeds.</p>
