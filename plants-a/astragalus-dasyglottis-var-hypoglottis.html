                    <h1>Astragalus dasyglottis var. hypoglottis</h1>
<p>Astragalus dasyglottis var. hypoglottis, commonly known as the narrow-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open to release the seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
