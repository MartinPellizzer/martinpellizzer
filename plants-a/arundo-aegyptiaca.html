                    <h1>Arundo aegyptiaca</h1>
<p>Arundo aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Nile River valley.</p>
<p>It can grow up to 6 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves and dense, cylindrical clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. This plant is highly adaptable, thriving in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and irrigation ditches. It is often used for erosion control and as a source of thatching or livestock fodder.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
