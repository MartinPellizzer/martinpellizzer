                    <h1>Avicennia oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Avicennia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, egg-shaped fruits. Its roots form dense networks that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Avicennia oblongifolia plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
