                        <h1>Acantholimon grammophyllum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon grammophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert environments. It has a compact growth habit and is known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats.</p>
