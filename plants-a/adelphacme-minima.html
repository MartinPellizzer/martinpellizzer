                <h1>Adelphacme minima</h1>
<p>Adelphacme minima, commonly known as the dwarf false dandelion, is a small annual herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelphacme minima has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelphacme minima is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the southern and central parts. This small annual herb thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the inland areas of Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelphacme minima was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments due to its drought tolerance. It spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
