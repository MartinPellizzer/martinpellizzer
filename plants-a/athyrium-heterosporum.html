                    <h1>Athyrium heterosporum</h1>
<p>Athyrium heterosporum, commonly known as the heterosporous lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a clump-forming habit. The plant produces two types of spores—megaspores and microspores—on separate sporangia, a feature that distinguishes it from many other ferns. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance.</p>
<p>Athyrium heterosporum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and stream banks.</p>
