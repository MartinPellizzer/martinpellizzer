                    <h1>Asperula lilaciflora var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Asperula lilaciflora var. caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth habit with small, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-lavender flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a groundcover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thick mats, providing both visual appeal and erosion control.</p>
