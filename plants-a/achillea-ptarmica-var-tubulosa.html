                <h1>Achillea ptarmica var. tubulosa</h1>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine and its ornamental value make it a notable species in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. tubulosa has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a silver-gray upper surface and a darker green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to grayish color, growing upright and branching sparingly. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread and survival in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. tubulosa is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to temperate regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, meadows, and grasslands, often growing in well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited native range and habitat specificity, it is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. tubulosa is a hardy perennial that is commonly propagated through division of the rootstock or by sowing seeds in early spring.</p>
<p>It has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring, flowering in summer, and dormancy again in late fall. This plant prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. tubulosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance garden diversity and support pollinator habitats. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates, further supporting the ecological balance of its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. tubulosa is a perennial flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its attractive, daisy-like flowers that provide visual appeal and support pollinators such as bees and butterflies. While not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically explored for its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities. Its presence in traditional herbal practices highlights its cultural significance in certain regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological biodiversity and can be used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
