                <h1>Abroma obliquum</h1>
<p>Abroma obliquum, commonly known as the crooked abroma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Abroma obliquum is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abroma obliquum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma obliquum is a flowering plant native to the eastern parts of the African continent, including countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across a range of habitats in these regions, particularly in areas with a subtropical climate. The plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its natural range, Abroma obliquum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating that it is not currently facing significant threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abroma obliquum is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Abroma obliquum includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage blooms are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
