<p>Arenaria emarginata subsp.</p>
<p>salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted to withstand drought and intense sunlight, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
