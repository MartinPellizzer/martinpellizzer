                    <h1>Astragalus prusianus var. lozantinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus prusianus var. lozantinus, commonly known as the Prussian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the central and eastern regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ecological and aesthetic value.</p>
