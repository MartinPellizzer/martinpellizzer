<p>Aristida loheri, commonly known as the Loher's threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces fluffy, three-awned spikelets that give it its common name. Its small, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Aristida loheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, low-maintenance conditions.</p>
