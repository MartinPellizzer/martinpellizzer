                <h1>Actinodaphne hayatae</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern China, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces berries that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne hayatae is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hayatae has elliptical, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a brownish bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, fragrant, and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters; they bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hayatae is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of the country, including the islands of Luzon and Mindanao. This species grows in lowland to montane forests, often in areas with high humidity and moderate rainfall. It is typically associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hayatae was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with secondary forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Its introduction has been largely due to human activity, including horticultural trade and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other species in the genus.</p>
