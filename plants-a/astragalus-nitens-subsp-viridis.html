<p>Astragalus nitens subsp.</p>
<p>viridis, commonly known as greenleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for semi-desert conditions.</p>
