                <h1>Acoelorraphe salvadorensis</h1>
<p>Acoelorraphe salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran acorae, is a flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acoraceae family, which includes aquatic and terrestrial plants. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Acoelorraphe salvadorensis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe salvadorensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe salvadorensis is primarily native to El Salvador.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry tropical regions of the country, particularly in the central and southern areas. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and semi-arid environments. It is also present in parts of Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Acoelorraphe salvadorensis is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe salvadorensis was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of Central America, particularly in El Salvador and neighboring countries.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores and in dune environments. This plant has adapted well to the tropical climate and saline conditions of its introduced range. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as coastal development and land use changes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in these regions.</p>
