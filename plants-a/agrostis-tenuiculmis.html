                    <h1>Agrostis tenuiculmis</h1>
<p>Agrostis tenuiculmis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, compact tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a component in native plant gardens.</p>
