<p>Almaleea cambagei, commonly known as the Cambage's almaleea, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Almaleea cambagei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
