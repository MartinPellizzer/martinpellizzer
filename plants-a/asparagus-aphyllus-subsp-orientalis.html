                    <h1>Asparagus aphyllus subsp. orientalis</h1>
<p>Asparagus aphyllus subsp.</p>
<p>orientalis, commonly known as the oriental asparagus, is a unique plant characterized by its lack of true leaves. Instead, it produces modified leaves called cladodes, which are flattened and photosynthetic.</p>
<p>The plant is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are succulent and can store water, an adaptation to its dry habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or green, and appear in clusters.</p>
