<p>Acacia coolgardiensis subsp.</p>
<p>latior, commonly known as the broad-leafed acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are broader than those of the typical acacia species.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically pollinated by birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native vegetation.</p>
