                <h1>Acacia coolgardiensis subsp. latior</h1>
<p>Acacia coolgardiensis subsp.</p>
<p>latior, commonly known as the broadleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in spirals along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use.</p>
<p>The subspecies latior is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to other subspecies of Acacia coolgardiensis.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia coolgardiensis subsp.</p>
<p>latior has leaves that are phyllodes, which are flattened and broad, with a lanceolate shape, alternate arrangement, and a dark green color. The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in dense globular heads, and bloom during the spring and summer, pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia coolgardiensis subsp.</p>
<p>latior is a shrub native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries like Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana. Its current distribution includes arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Kalahari and Succulent Karoo biomes.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia coolgardiensis subsp.</p>
<p>latior is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to southern Africa, known for its distinctive foliage and resilience. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, making it ideal for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be light and applied in spring, while pruning is minimal, mainly for shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally pest and disease-resistant, though aphids and scale insects may occasionally infest it.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant succulents or native grasses can enhance its aesthetic and ecological value.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia coolgardiensis subsp.</p>
<p>latior is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds with its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting surrounding vegetation. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in arid environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant, enhancing the biodiversity and resilience of local ecosystems.</p>
