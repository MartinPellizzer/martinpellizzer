                <h1>Aconitum dolichostachyum</h1>
<p>Aconitum dolichostachyum, commonly known as the long-stalked monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, and it produces a tall, sparsely branched stem. Aconitum dolichostachyum is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum dolichostachyum has large, deeply lobed leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically heart-shaped or ovate, ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that is somewhat fibrous in texture. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spikes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two showy petals; they bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum dolichostachyum is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude regions of this region, typically in alpine meadows and rocky areas. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within Tibet, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum dolichostachyum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and garden cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northeastern United States, particularly in states like New York, Vermont, and Pennsylvania. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has become naturalized in some areas, posing a potential risk to native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with caution.</p>
