                <h1>Adicea serrulata</h1>
<p>Adicea serrulata, commonly known as the serrated adicea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are serrated, giving it its common name, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Adicea serrulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea serrulata has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea serrulata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of India and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some regions of Africa and the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea serrulata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
