<p>Arrhostoxylum acutangulum, commonly known as the Andean thornbush, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
