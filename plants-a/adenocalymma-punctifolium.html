                <h1>Adenocalymma punctifolium</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma punctifolium, commonly known as the punctate leaf adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves with distinctive punctate markings. It produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma punctifolium is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma punctifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma punctifolium is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and western regions of the country. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils along the shoreline. It is often associated with coastal dunes and sandplain habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within South Africa due to its particular environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma punctifolium was mainly introduced to the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
<p>It has also been recorded in parts of Argentina and Paraguay, where it has established populations in disturbed habitats. The plant is typically found in grasslands and open areas with well-drained soils. Its introduction is believed to be associated with human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains limited compared to other invasive species in the region.</p>
