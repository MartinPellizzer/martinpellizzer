<p>Adicea lucens, commonly known as the shining adicea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea lucens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy green color and a serrated margin, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea lucens is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
