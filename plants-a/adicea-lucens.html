<p>Adicea lucens, commonly known as the shining adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in a fine, silvery bloom.</p>
<p>Adicea lucens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea lucens has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and exhibit a striking white with pinkish hues, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other flying insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea lucens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland environments with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in rainforests and secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of northeastern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea lucens was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading along coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its successful establishment. It is now considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are being considered to monitor and manage its spread.</p>
