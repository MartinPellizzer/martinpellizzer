                    <h1>Aspalathus stenophylla</h1>
<p>Aspalathus stenophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf rooibos, is a South African plant native to the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and is closely related to the more well-known rooibos tea plant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Aspalathus stenophylla is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
