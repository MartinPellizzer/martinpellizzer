                    <h1>Aridaria oculata</h1>
<p>Aridaria oculata, commonly known as the eyeleaf plant, is a succulent native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its unique leaf structure, with a distinct "eye" marking on each leaf, makes it easily identifiable.</p>
<p>Aridaria oculata thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
