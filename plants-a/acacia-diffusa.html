                    <h1>Acacia diffusa</h1>
<p>Acacia diffusa, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features slender, often branched stems covered in soft, grayish-green bark. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny, thread-like leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia diffusa is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
