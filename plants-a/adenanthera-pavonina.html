                    <h1>Adenanthera pavonina</h1>
<p>Adenanthera pavonina, commonly known as the "peacock bean," is a tropical leguminous plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, feathery, pink or red flowers that resemble a peacock's tail, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it valuable in agricultural systems.</p>
