                <h1>Adenanthera pavonina</h1>
<p>Adenanthera pavonina, commonly known as the "peacock bean," is a tropical leguminous plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, feathery, pink or red flowers that resemble a peacock's tail, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it valuable in agricultural systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera pavonina has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval-shaped, slightly hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, rough to the touch, and has a light greyish-brown bark that peels off in strips. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a slender, elongated pod that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera pavonina is primarily native to the Andaman Is., Assam, Bangladesh, Bismarck Archipelago, Borneo, Cambodia, Hainan, India, Jawa, Laos, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, Maldives, Maluku, Myanmar, New Guinea, Nicobar Is., Northern Territory, Puerto Rico, Queensland, Solomon Is., Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is a tropical and subtropical species commonly found in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed areas, riverbanks, and forest edges. It is known for its distinctive pink or red flowers and its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution across Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific reflects its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera pavonina was mainly introduced to a wide range of tropical and subtropical regions across Africa, the Americas, and the Pacific Islands, including Angola, Bahamas, Cameroon, and many others listed.</p>
<p>It has been widely spread due to its use as a forage plant and its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. The introduction of this plant has often been intentional, driven by agricultural and ecological needs in these regions. It is now considered an invasive species in several areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its presence highlights the impact of human activity on plant distribution and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
