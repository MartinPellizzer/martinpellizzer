                    <h1>Amaranthus caudatus var. alopecurus</h1>
<p>Amaranthus caudatus var. alopecurus, commonly known as the curly top amaranth, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted inflorescence that resembles a plume or a feather. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that give way to triangular, bead-like seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is primarily due to its unique, curly seed heads, which are used in dried floral arrangements.</p>
