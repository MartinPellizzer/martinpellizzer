                <h1>Adiantum crenatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum crenatum, commonly known as the notched maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often tinged with a pale green or silver hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its small, spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum crenatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum crenatum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a serrated or scalloped edge, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measuring around 10-30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green, and they are borne on delicate, slender stems that are often creeping or ascending. The plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The overall morphology of Adiantum crenatum is adapted for moist, shaded environments, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum crenatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. The plant is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical regions, where it grows on rocky outcrops or in moist soil. Its distribution extends to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum crenatum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along streams. This fern has been reported in several states including Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia. Its introduction is likely due to natural dispersal via wind or water, as well as human activities.</p>
<p>It is considered non-invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
