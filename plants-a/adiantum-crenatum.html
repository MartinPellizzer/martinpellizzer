                    <h1>Adiantum crenatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum crenatum, commonly known as the notched maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often tinged with a pale green or silver hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its small, spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum crenatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions.</p>
