<p>Alnus sinuata var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered catkins in early spring, which are male and female flowers, typical of the Betulaceae family. Its root system is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil restoration.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture.</p>
