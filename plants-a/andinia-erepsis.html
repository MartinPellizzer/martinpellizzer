                    <h1>Andinia erepsis</h1>
<p>Andinia erepsis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its bark is rich in aromatic compounds and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Andinia erepsis is now considered an endangered species.</p>
