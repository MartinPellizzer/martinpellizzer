<p>Alnus viridis subf.</p>
<p>glabra, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil.</p>
