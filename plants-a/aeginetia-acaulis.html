                <h1>Aeginetia acaulis</h1>
<p>Aeginetia acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in conditions of extreme drought.</p>
<p>Aeginetia acaulis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia acaulis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually light green and vary in size depending on light exposure.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and smooth, with a pale green color, and grows in a rosette pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions.</p>
