<p>Acacia yorkrakinensis subsp.</p>
<p>yorkrakinensis, commonly known as the Yorkrakin acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow to orange globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood.</p>
