                    <h1>Asplenium umbrosum var. tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Asplenium umbrosum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a shade-tolerant fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on rocky outcrops or in moist, shaded forest floors. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to humid, cool environments and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
