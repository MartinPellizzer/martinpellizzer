                <h1>Acinodendron calophyllum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron calophyllum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron calophyllum has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a size ranging from 5 to 12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in panicles, bloom during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron calophyllum is primarily native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary forests, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. This plant is often associated with riverine and coastal areas, where it benefits from the moist and nutrient-rich soils. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these regions by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but rare component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron calophyllum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites where it can thrive in sandy or loamy soils. The plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>However, its spread is often limited by local climate conditions and competition with native vegetation.</p>
