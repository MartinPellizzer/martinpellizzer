                    <h1>Acacia ophiolithica</h1>
<p>Acacia ophiolithica, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Acacia ophiolithica plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
