                        <h1>Acacia ophiolithica</h1>
<p>Acacia ophiolithica, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Acacia ophiolithica plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia ophiolithica belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have leaves with a stipulate base and produce legume fruits. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their unique foliage and often used in various ecological and economic contexts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia ophiolithica, a specific type of acacia found in rocky or arid environments, adapted to survive in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ophiolithica is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandplains of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and western parts of Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ophiolithica was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions due to its drought-resistant properties and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall, such as deserts and rocky outcrops. The plant is valued for its hardy nature, making it suitable for land rehabilitation and soil stabilization projects. Its introduction has also been associated with ornamental use in landscaping.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, outcompeting native flora.</p>
