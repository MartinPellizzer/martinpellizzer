                        <h1>Acacia cubensis</h1>
<p>Acacia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban acacia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia cubensis is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cubensis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, tropical climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and limestone soils. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, often growing in open woodlands and scrublands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, Acacia cubensis is considered a rare and endemic plant in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cubensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential use in agroforestry systems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited for these regions. It has been reported to naturalize in some areas, posing a potential risk to native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in urban and rural landscapes across its introduced range.</p>
