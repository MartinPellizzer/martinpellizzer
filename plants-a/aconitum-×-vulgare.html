                    <h1>Aconitum × vulgare</h1>
<p>Aconitum × vulgare, commonly known as the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid called aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and it thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Aconitum × vulgare is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value despite its dangerous properties.</p>
