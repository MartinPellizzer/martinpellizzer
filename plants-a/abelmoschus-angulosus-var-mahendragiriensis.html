<p>Abelmoschus angulosus var. mahendragiriensis, commonly known as Mahendragiri okra, is a variant of the okra species native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its angular, ridged leaves and yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant produces edible, mucilaginous pods that are typically harvested when young and tender. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique flavor and nutritional content, making it a significant crop in certain regions of India.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus angulosus var. mahendragiriensis is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of India, particularly in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Sri Lanka and the northeastern states of India. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas, along riverbanks, and in cultivated fields.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the humid and warm environments of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus angulosus var. mahendragiriensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight. This variety is particularly adapted to the semi-arid regions of southern India, where it has been cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. Its introduction has contributed to local agricultural diversity and provided a source of nutrition in certain communities.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by environmental constraints and competition with native flora.</p>
