                <h1>Adenocalymma standleyanum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma standleyanum, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate and palmately lobed, while its stems are hairy and erect.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma standleyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma standleyanum has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma standleyanum is primarily native to South America, specifically the Amazon Basin and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the dense vegetation of the Amazonian ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma standleyanum was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its unique leaf structure and aesthetic appeal. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success in new environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is necessary to prevent its spread beyond controlled areas.</p>
