                    <h1>Apostasia nuda</h1>
<p>Apostasia nuda, commonly known as the naked apostasia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are predominantly pollinated by flies and beetles, which are attracted to its strong, musky scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Apostasia nuda is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
