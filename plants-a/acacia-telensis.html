<p>Acacia telensis, commonly known as the Telensiskoak, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia telensis is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
