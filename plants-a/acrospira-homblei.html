                <h1>Acrospira homblei</h1>
<p>Acrospira homblei, commonly known as the Hombli's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, a common feature among Euphorbiaceae species.</p>
<p>Acrospira homblei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospira homblei has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrospira homblei is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including regions such as Hawaii, Fiji, and Tonga.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats, where it thrives in the humid and tropical climate. This plant is often associated with maritime environments and is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited native range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrospira homblei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1980s and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, urban environments, and along riverbanks. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
