                <h1>Aconitum koelleanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum, commonly known as the Koelreuter's aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and dark purple to brown in color, with a branched growth pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and adapted for anchoring and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. This species is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where the climate is cool and moist. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, which includes high levels of UV radiation and poor soil.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally found in the Himalayan regions of China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature. It can outcompete native species for resources like sunlight and nutrients.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
