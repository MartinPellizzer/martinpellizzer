<p>Arcytophyllum recurvatum, commonly known as the Tibetan sandthorn, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and thorny stems, which help it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss and are adapted to the extreme climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Arcytophyllum recurvatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range.</p>
