                <h1>Acranthera atropella</h1>
<p>Acranthera atropella, commonly known as the dark-flowered acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its tubular, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Acranthera atropella is often found in fynbos vegetation and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera atropella has small, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with a tubular shape and five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera atropella is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Malay Archipelago. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically in lowland to mid-elevation areas. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within the region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera atropella was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. It is considered a weed in some parts of its range due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native insects.</p>
