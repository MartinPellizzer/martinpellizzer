                <h1>Achneria ecklonii</h1>
<p>Achneria ecklonii, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria ecklonii has leaves that are simple, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, usually dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria ecklonii is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to specific areas within these countries, often in fragmented habitats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and rocky slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achneria ecklonii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achneria ecklonii is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, especially in warm climates, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achneria ecklonii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
