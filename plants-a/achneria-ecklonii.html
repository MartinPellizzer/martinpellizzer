<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and it produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds. Achneria ecklonii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its ability to attract pollinators and its adaptability to various climates contribute to its ecological and horticultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria ecklonii has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the underside, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers.
