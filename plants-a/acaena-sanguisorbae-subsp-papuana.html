                        <h1>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. papuana</h1>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>papuana, commonly known as the Papuan bentthorn, is a species native to New Guinea. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense growth habit and thorny stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds enclosed in prickly burrs, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>papuana is primarily native to New Guinea. It is found in the lowland and montane regions of the island, particularly in moist, shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly associated with humid tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives in areas with well-drained to moderately wet soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within New Guinea's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>papuana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental or horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is now considered an environmental weed in certain areas of New Zealand. It spreads readily in disturbed soils and can form dense stands that outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns regarding its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
