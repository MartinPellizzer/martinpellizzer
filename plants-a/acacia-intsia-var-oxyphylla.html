                <h1>Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the white acacia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are feathery in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its seeds are encased in flat, woody pods that split open when mature.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, typically 30-50 cm long and dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a erect growth pattern. The flowers are yellow, clustered in dense globular inflorescences, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Indonesia and the Philippines, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. This species prefers lowland and hill forest environments, typically growing in well-drained soils. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla is a resilient, fast-growing tree native to Southeast Asia, commonly cultivated for its ornamental value and timber.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a warm, moist environment for germination. The growth cycle includes a rapid initial growth phase followed by a slower maturation period, typically reaching maturity within 5-10 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can enhance soil fertility and promote healthy growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla is an important plant in tropical ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, as well as herbivores like monkeys and rodents. Its deep root system acts as a natural erosion control agent, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas. The plant also serves as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shade and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting overall ecological health.</p>
