                <h1>Acrostichum hystrix</h1>
<p>Acrostichum hystrix, commonly known as the hawksbeard fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Acrostichum hystrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hystrix has large, lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hystrix is primarily native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, including the Amazon Basin and other parts of the neotropics. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and swamps. It is often associated with riverbanks and areas with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Its native distribution includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hystrix was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its adaptability to saline and poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is often used for erosion control and as a ornamental species in wetland landscapes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
