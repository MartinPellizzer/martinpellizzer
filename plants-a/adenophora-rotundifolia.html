                <h1>Adenophora rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Adenophora rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate to round leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive basal rosette. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Adenophora rotundifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora rotundifolia has round or slightly heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range from pale blue to violet, blooming in late summer to early fall, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora rotundifolia is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Korea and Japan, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Adenophora rotundifolia is listed as vulnerable due to its limited habitat and threats from human activities.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora rotundifolia is a beautiful flowering plant native to East Asia, known for its delicate pink or white flowers and rounded leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification for better germination. This plant has a cool season growth cycle, blooming in early summer and going dormant in winter, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials like hostas or ferns can enhance its ornamental value in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenophora rotundifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, particularly in moist or wetland environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering shelter to ground-dwelling insects and animals.</p>
