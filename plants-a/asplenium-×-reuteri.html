                    <h1>Asplenium × reuteri</h1>
<p>Asplenium × reuteri, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for spore dispersal. Asplenium × reuteri thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
