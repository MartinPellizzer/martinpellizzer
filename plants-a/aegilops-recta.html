                <h1>Aegilops recta</h1>
<p>Aegilops recta, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilops recta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its seeds are sometimes used in agricultural research due to their potential genetic contributions to wheat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops recta has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 30 cm in length, with a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, and grows upright with a clumping growth pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers that bloom in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in dry, sandy soils.</p>
