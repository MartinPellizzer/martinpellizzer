                <h1>Adenocarpus divaricatus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable burr mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces distinctive, hairy, spiny capsules that contain its seeds. Its flowers are small and usually pale pink to white, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its variable growth form and adaptability to different environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus divaricatus has leaves that are alternate, lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus divaricatus is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is commonly associated with savanna and grassland ecosystems. It is well adapted to withstand periods of drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the African continent, with limited occurrence in neighboring regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus divaricatus was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its spread across various parts of the country, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
