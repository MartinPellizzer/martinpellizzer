<p>Artemisia camphorata subsp.</p>
<p>canescens, commonly known as grey artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic properties and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant.</p>
