<p>Asplenium brachyopterum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides.</p>
