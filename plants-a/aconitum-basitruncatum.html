                <h1>Aconitum basitruncatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum basitruncatum, commonly known as the blunt-root monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with a distinctive veined structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum basitruncatum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and greenish-yellow, often becoming slightly woody at the base, with a straight growth pattern. The flowers are blue to purple, arranged in tall, sparsely branched racemes, with a spurred petal and showy sepals, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, serving as storage organs and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum basitruncatum is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the high-altitude regions of Tibet, where it thrives in cool and moist environments. It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky areas at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific region, making it a unique component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum basitruncatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily introduced as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue to purple flowers and unique foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in wetland and riparian habitats, often thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a non-native invasive species in several areas where it has established itself.</p>
