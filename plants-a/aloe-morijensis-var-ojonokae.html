                    <h1>Aloe morijensis var. ojonokae</h1>
<p>Aloe morijensis var. ojonokae, commonly known as the Ojonokae aloe, is a rare and striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple hue, often marked with white or yellowish markings. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
