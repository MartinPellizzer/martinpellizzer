                        <h1>Abrotanum alpestre</h1>
<p>Abrotanum alpestre, commonly known as alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Abrotanum alpestre is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum alpestre is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, including parts of Spain, Italy, and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. This plant is commonly associated with high-altitude areas where the climate is cool and the growing season is short. It is also present in some regions of North Africa, such as Morocco and Algeria.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum alpestre was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and rocky areas where it can thrive with minimal care. This plant has been reported in several countries, including parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered low risk in most environments due to its limited spread and specific habitat preferences.</p>
