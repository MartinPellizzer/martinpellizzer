                    <h1>Acorus aromaticus</h1>
<p>Acorus aromaticus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomes are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Acorus aromaticus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
