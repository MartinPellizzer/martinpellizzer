                <h1>Acorus aromaticus</h1>
<p>Acorus aromaticus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomes are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Acorus aromaticus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus aromaticus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically measuring up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows from the base of the plant. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, usually yellowish-green in color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming dense underground networks that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus aromaticus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of India and China, where it grows in similar wetland conditions.</p>
<p>Acorus aromaticus is an important species in traditional medicine and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic rhizomes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus aromaticus was mainly introduced to freshwater wetlands and slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich environments with ample sunlight. This plant is often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and rivers. Its presence can alter water chemistry and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
