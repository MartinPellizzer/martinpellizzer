                    <h1>Arthrostylidium punctulatum</h1>
<p>Arthrostylidium punctulatum, commonly known as the punctuated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its berries, which are usually red or orange in color.</p>
<p>Arthrostylidium punctulatum is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
