                <h1>Acmispon dendroideus</h1>
<p>Acmispon dendroideus, commonly known as the tree burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to form dense, thorny thickets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acmispon dendroideus is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon dendroideus has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 1 to 3 inches.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and somewhat branched, with a rough texture and a grayish-brown color, growing in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon dendroideus is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. The species is well adapted to the climate conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its local environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon dendroideus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida.</p>
<p>It was introduced as a forage crop for livestock due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its establishment in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits as a forage plant, its invasive nature poses challenges for ecological management.</p>
