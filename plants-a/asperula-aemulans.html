<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and rhododendrons. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring.

<p>Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant pink to red blooms, which resemble those of azaleas, hence its common name.</p>
