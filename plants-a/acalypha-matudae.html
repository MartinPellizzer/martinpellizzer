                        <h1>Acalypha matudae</h1>
<p>Acalypha matudae, commonly known as the Matudae spurflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescences that resemble small flowers, though they are actually modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are usually ovate or lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acalypha matudae is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha matudae is primarily native to the island of Guam in the Mariana Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland rainforests and coastal areas of the island. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly seen in shaded understory environments within the native vegetation of Guam.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species to the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha matudae was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1950s and has since spread to several islands. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
