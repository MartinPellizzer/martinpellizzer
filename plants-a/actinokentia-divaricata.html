                <h1>Actinokentia divaricata</h1>
<p>Actinokentia divaricata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets that are often arranged in a feather-like pattern. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it can grow as a tree or shrub depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Actinokentia divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its vibrant floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinokentia divaricata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 10â€“20 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend support structures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinokentia divaricata is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland and montane rainforests. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich soil. It is commonly found in the vicinity of rivers and in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinokentia divaricata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to temperate climates.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic plant species. Despite its initial popularity, the plant has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its spread across the landscape.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its population and protect native biodiversity.</p>
