                    <h1>Angraecum xylopus</h1>
<p>Angraecum xylopus, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant produces a unique fragrance that attracts its primary pollinator, the star moth (Clepsis perornata). Angraecum xylopus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary adaptation to specific pollination mechanisms.</p>
