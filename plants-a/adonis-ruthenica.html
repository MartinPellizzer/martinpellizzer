                <h1>Adonis ruthenica</h1>
<p>Adonis ruthenica, commonly known as the Caucasian Adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered rare in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis ruthenica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, branching, and have a smooth, grayish-brown bark with a slightly woody texture. The flowers are showy, with a single, bright yellow ray floret surrounded by a green, tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ruthenica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This species is also present in the Caucasus region, extending into southern Russia and northern Iran. It prefers well-drained, sunny environments and is commonly found in meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ruthenica was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the western United States. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some areas where it competes with native flora.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in ecosystems where it is not native.</p>
