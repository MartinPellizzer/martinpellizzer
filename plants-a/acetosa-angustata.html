<p>Acetosa angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 20â€“40 cm, featuring slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them a sharp, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Acetosa angustata is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued both for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
