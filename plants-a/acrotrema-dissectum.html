                    <h1>Acrotrema dissectum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema dissectum, commonly known as the dissected acrotrema, is a rare and delicate liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth on moist, shaded substrates. The plant thrives in humid environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices where moisture is consistently present. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically hidden within the leaf structures, making it challenging to identify without close examination.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acrotrema dissectum is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and biodiversity.</p>
