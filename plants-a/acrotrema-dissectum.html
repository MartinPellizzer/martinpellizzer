                <h1>Acrotrema dissectum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema dissectum, commonly known as the dissected acrotrema, is a rare and delicate liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth on moist, shaded substrates. The plant thrives in humid environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices where moisture is consistently present. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically hidden within the leaf structures, making it challenging to identify without close examination.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acrotrema dissectum is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema dissectum has leaves that are finely dissected, resembling a fern, with a dark green color and a serrated edge.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that becomes rough as the plant matures. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema dissectum is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forested areas. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific climate of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island's native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema dissectum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has shown adaptability to various climates, allowing it to spread beyond its original range. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental foliage.</p>
