<p>Acaena echinata var. subglabricalyx, commonly known as the smooth-fruited burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with spiny margins and produces small, red, edible berries that are often consumed by birds. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of five sepals and no petals, and it relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and forested areas.</p>
