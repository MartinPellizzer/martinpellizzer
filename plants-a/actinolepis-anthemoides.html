                <h1>Actinolepis anthemoides</h1>
<p>Actinolepis anthemoides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, yellow-orange flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Actinolepis anthemoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolepis anthemoides has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, yellowish-green structures that bloom in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis anthemoides is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal regions of Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is commonly found in dune habitats and disturbed areas near the shoreline. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis anthemoides was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy soils in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is commonly found in dunes and coastal prairies. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize sand. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
