                <h1>Adonis micrantha</h1>
<p>Adonis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other similar plants. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adonis micrantha is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis micrantha has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring about 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with yellow petals and a dark red center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis micrantha is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Canary Islands and extends into North Africa, particularly Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is often associated with open grasslands and scrublands at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Adonis micrantha is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its showy, yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis micrantha was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Proper monitoring is essential to manage its distribution and impact on local ecosystems.</p>
