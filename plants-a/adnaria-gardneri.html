                <h1>Adnaria gardneri</h1>
<p>Adnaria gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's adnaria, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes plants known for their milky sap and often showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, featuring opposite, simple leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, woody fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Adnaria gardneri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria gardneri has small, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green in color and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered, and white or pale yellow, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria gardneri is primarily native to the southern coastal regions of Australia, particularly in the states of Western Australia and South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastlines and in dunes. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in association with other coastal flora. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian coastline, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Adnaria gardneri plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria gardneri was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been introduced through ballast water discharge from ships. This species has established itself in shallow marine habitats, often near rocky shores. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native marine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it remains a relatively rare and localized invader in the region.</p>
