<p>Acacia flexuosa var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and phyllodes that are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>The silky hairs on its foliage give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
