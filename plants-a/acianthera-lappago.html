                <h1>Acianthera lappago</h1>
<p>Acianthera lappago, commonly known as the Lappago orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and moths.</p>
<p>Acianthera lappago is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera lappago has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and white or pale green, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera lappago is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the western part of the country, particularly in the provinces of Pichincha, Cotopaxi, and Azuay. This orchid typically grows in cloud forests and humid montane regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich soil.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its small, fragrant flowers and is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera lappago was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and degraded forests. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread and impact on native ecosystems.</p>
