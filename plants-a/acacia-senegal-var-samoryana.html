                        <h1>Acacia senegal var. samoryana</h1>
<p>Acacia senegal var. samoryana, commonly known as the gum arabic tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, fissured bark and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by long, slender pods containing a sticky, resinous gum known as gum arabic. This gum is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries due to its emulsifying and stabilizing properties.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments and is well adapted to poor soil conditions.</p>
