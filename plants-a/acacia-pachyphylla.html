<p>Acacia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, clustered leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are arranged in globular inflorescences. Its thick, fleshy leaves are a key adaptation to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Acacia pachyphylla is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
