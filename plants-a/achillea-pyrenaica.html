                <h1>Achillea pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica, commonly known as Pyrenean yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the leaves are finely divided with a strong, herbaceous scent.</p>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a silvery-gray underside, arranged in a rosette, and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions in southern Spain, particularly in the provinces of Cádiz, Málaga, and Seville, as well as parts of Portugal. It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as scrublands, grasslands, and forest edges. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea pyrenaica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division of the root system, or by cutting during the early spring or summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and provide natural pest deterrence.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in natural habitats, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecological balance. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or degraded areas.</p>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica also contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and supporting microbial activity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and traditional uses.</p>
<p>It has been used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. While not widely used in culinary applications, it may be incorporated into local herbal teas or infusions. In cultural contexts, it has symbolic significance in folklore and may be associated with themes of protection or healing.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also contributes to its value in supporting biodiversity and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Purpurea' and 'Moorpark,' known for their vibrant purple and pink flowers, respectively. While true hybrids of Achillea pyrenaica are relatively rare, crossbreeding with other species like Achillea millefolium has led to some horticultural varieties. These plants are valued in gardens for their long bloom period and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to add color and texture to rock gardens and borders.</p>
