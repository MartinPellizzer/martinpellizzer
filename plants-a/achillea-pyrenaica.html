                <h1>Achillea pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica, commonly known as Pyrenean yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly fuzzy foliage and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in fine hairs, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base to a height of about 30â€“60 cm. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped umbels, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in rocky or dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica is primarily native to France and Spain.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of these countries, particularly in the Pyrenees and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open grasslands and on slopes. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that plays a role in the local flora of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pyrenaica was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in regions of southern Europe, including Spain, Italy, and parts of France. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, particularly through horticultural practices and accidental spread.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
