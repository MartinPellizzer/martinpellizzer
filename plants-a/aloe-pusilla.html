                    <h1>Aloe pusilla</h1>
<p>Aloe pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a small succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on slender stalks during the warmer months. Aloe pusilla is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves for survival.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
