                    <h1>Avicularia vulgaris</h1>
<p>Avicularia vulgaris, commonly known as the common sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Actinioidea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent polyps surrounded by a ring of tentacles used for capturing prey. The organism lacks a true digestive system and relies on extracellular digestion within a gastrovascular cavity. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates.</p>
<p>Avicularia vulgaris plays a role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey, contributing to the balance of benthic communities.</p>
