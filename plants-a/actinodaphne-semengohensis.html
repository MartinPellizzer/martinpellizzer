The plant typically grows in lowland dipterocarp forests, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its unique botanical features include a smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves with a distinct aromatic scent.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne semengohensis has compound, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.

<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne semengohensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It thrives in lowland and hill forest habitats, often growing as an understory plant. The plant is known for its aromatic leaves and is part of the Lauraceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Borneo, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne semengohensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. Its introduction has been documented in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
