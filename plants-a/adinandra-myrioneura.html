                <h1>Adinandra myrioneura</h1>
<p>Adinandra myrioneura, commonly known as the yellow-veined evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent yellow veins. It produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adinandra myrioneura is typically found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra myrioneura has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and twining, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra myrioneura is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, where it thrives in humid and warm conditions. The plant is typically associated with lowland and hill forest environments. It plays a role in the ecological balance of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island of Borneo, with limited occurrence in neighboring areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra myrioneura was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in warm and moist environments. This plant has been introduced to several Pacific islands, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia, often as an ornamental or for ecological restoration purposes. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in disturbed or degraded ecosystems.</p>
