<p>Adiantum hirtum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum hirtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
