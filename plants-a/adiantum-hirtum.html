                <h1>Adiantum hirtum</h1>
<p>Adiantum hirtum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum hirtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum hirtum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and have a delicate, light green color with a slight pubescence on the underside. The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clumping pattern.</p>
<p>Adiantum hirtum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds; it does not produce true flowers in the sense of showy blooms. The plant does not form true fruits or seeds; instead, it reproduces via spores, which are dispersed by wind from the sori.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor the plant to the soil, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hirtum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments like forests and stream banks. This fern is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. It is also found in parts of India and Malaysia, where it adapts well to the local climate.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is closely linked to its preference for high humidity and indirect sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hirtum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and garden cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. The plant's delicate fronds and ability to thrive in humid conditions have made it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it has also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its spread highlights the ecological impact of introduced plant species on local ecosystems.</p>
