                    <h1>Asplenium × joncheerei</h1>
<p>Asplenium × joncheerei, commonly known as the hybrid bird's nest fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is a compact, epiphytic fern characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a rosette-like structure, resembling a bird's nest. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically clustered in small, fleshy structures called sorangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium × joncheerei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care.</p>
