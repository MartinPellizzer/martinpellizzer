                        <h1>Acacia humifusa</h1>
<p>Acacia humifusa, commonly known as the low acacia or coastal acacia, is a small shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with small, pointed leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia humifusa is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia humifusa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive foliage and often used in various ecological and economic contexts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia humifusa, a specific type of acacia known for its low-growing habit and is native to certain regions in Australia.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia humifusa is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Acacia humifusa is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and suitable habitats in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia humifusa was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland regions with a temperate to subtropical climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, shrublands, and along roadsides. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal environments. It is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
