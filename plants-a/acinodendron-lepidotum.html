                <h1>Acinodendron lepidotum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron lepidotum, commonly known as the velvetleaf acacia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lepidotum has simple, alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels off in small flakes, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out just below the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lepidotum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with riverine and swampy habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within the Indo-Malesian flora zone.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lepidotum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and along riverbanks. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
