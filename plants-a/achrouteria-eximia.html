                <h1>Achrouteria eximia</h1>
<p>Achrouteria eximia, commonly known as the golden aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Achrouteria eximia is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achrouteria eximia has narrow, elongated leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, with a grass-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>
