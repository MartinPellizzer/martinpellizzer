                    <h1>Actinostemma lobatum var. semilobatum</h1>
<p>Actinostemma lobatum var. semilobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed actinostemma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, with the lower leaves being more deeply divided than the upper ones.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its semi-lobed leaf structure, which sets it apart from the typical lobed form of the species.</p>
