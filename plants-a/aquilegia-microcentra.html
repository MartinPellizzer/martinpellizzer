                    <h1>Aquilegia microcentra</h1>
<p>Aquilegia microcentra, commonly known as the small-centred columbine, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Sierra Nevada of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals that range in color from blue to purple, which attract specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided leaflets that help it conserve moisture in its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aquilegia microcentra is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its ecological niche.</p>
