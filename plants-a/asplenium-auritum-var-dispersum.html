                    <h1>Asplenium auritum var. dispersum</h1>
<p>Asplenium auritum var. dispersum, commonly known as the scattered ear spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant typically thrives in moist, humid environments, often found in shaded forest floors or on rock faces. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more scattered growth pattern compared to the typical form of A. auritum.</p>
