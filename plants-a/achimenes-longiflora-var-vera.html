<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are tubular with a spurred base, displaying vibrant pink to red colors, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, allowing the plant to store nutrients and survive in varying soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes longiflora var. vera is a tropical flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including tropical and subtropical regions of the United States, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and increasing threats from habitat destruction, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though it remains more widely distributed in cultivation than in the wild.</p>
