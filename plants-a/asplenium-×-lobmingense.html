                    <h1>Asplenium × lobmingense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × lobmingense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with the fronds often displaying a distinctive 'maidenhair' appearance due to their finely divided, thread-like pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions where its parent species co-occur.</p>
<p>As a hybrid, it does not produce viable spores and is primarily propagated through vegetative means.</p>
