<p>Atriplex stipitata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Atriplex stipitata is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
