                <h1>Actephila subsessilis</h1>
<p>Actephila subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved actephila, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Actephila subsessilis is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila subsessilis has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila subsessilis is primarily native to China South-Central, Malaya, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The distribution includes both mainland and insular regions within its native range.</p>
<p>It is a relatively rare species with limited geographic occurrence.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila subsessilis was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states, including Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. The plant thrives in forest understories and along stream banks, where it competes with native species for resources. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it has become a concern in some ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised questions about its impact on local biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
