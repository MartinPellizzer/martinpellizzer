<p>Asplenium approximatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can anchor itself to surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Asplenium approximatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems.</p>
