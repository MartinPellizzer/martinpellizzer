<p>Atriplex matamorensis, commonly known as Matamoras saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and saltbush communities.</p>
<p>Atriplex matamorensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
