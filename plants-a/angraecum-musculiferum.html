                    <h1>Angraecum musculiferum</h1>
<p>Angraecum musculiferum, commonly known as the muscle orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features long, slender, and often curling green pseudobulbs that resemble muscles, giving it its common name. The plant produces pendulous, white or pale green flowers with intricate, spurred petals that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
