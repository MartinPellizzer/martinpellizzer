                    <h1>Asclepias ferruginea</h1>
<p>Asclepias ferruginea, commonly known as the rust-pink milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and leaves that are often tinged with a rusty color. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Asclepias ferruginea plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
