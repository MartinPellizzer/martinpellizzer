                <h1>Aechmea exotica</h1>
<p>Aechmea exotica, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a pineapple in appearance. Aechmea exotica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea exotica has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a dense layer of silvery hairs, with a deep green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a compact rosette at the base of the plant, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant lacks a true stem, but it does have a short, thick base that supports the rosette and may have a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are borne in a spike-like inflorescence, with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange, and they bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
