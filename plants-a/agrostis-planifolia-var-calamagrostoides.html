                    <h1>Agrostis planifolia var. calamagrostoides</h1>
<p>Agrostis planifolia var. calamagrostoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a variant of the wheatgrass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its fine texture and ability to form dense mats make it an attractive ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other wheatgrass varieties due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
