                    <h1>Alnus ferruginea</h1>
<p>Alnus ferruginea, commonly known as the brown alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and its fruit is a small, winged nut. Alnus ferruginea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life.</p>
