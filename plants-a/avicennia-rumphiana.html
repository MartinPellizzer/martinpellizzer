<p>Avicennia rumphiana, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, such as estuaries and coastal areas, and has specialized adaptations for salt tolerance. The plant possesses pneumatophores, which are root-like structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its small, white flowers are followed by edible berries that provide food for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Avicennia rumphiana plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
