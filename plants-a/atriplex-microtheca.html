                    <h1>Atriplex microtheca</h1>
<p>Atriplex microtheca, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex microtheca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
