                <h1>Adiantum fruticosum</h1>
<p>Adiantum fruticosum, commonly known as the rock fern or creeping spleenwort, is a species of fern native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum fruticosum is a low-maintenance plant that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to colonize rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fruticosum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, finely toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure about 20-30 cm in length, displaying a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows horizontally along the ground, often forming dense mats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, arranged in clusters, with no distinct petals, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spore-bearing structure, and the plant relies on wind for spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fruticosum is primarily native to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, coastal areas and along cliffs. This fern thrives in temperate climates and is often seen growing on limestone or sandy soils. It is particularly common in regions with mild, maritime conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, France, and parts of southern England.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fruticosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it was brought for ornamental purposes due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks, where it spreads through its rhizomes. Although it is not considered invasive, it can form dense mats that may outcompete native vegetation in some habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to the northern parts of New Zealand, with limited reports in the southern regions.</p>
