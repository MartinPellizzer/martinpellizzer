                <h1>Acalypha parvula</h1>
<p>Acalypha parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Acalypha parvula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha parvula has small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, semi-woody, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a spreading or creeping pattern. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spikes, with a pale yellow or greenish color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through dryness, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>
