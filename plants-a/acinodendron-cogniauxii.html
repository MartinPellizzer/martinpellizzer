                <h1>Acinodendron cogniauxii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron cogniauxii, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acinodendron cogniauxii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cogniauxii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cogniauxii is primarily native to the western regions of tropical Africa, specifically countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist forested areas and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Acinodendron cogniauxii is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cogniauxii was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Madagascar, the Comoros, and parts of Southeast Asia. This plant has been introduced to new habitats due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions. However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements and the presence of native flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it is not considered an invasive species in most areas where it has been established.</p>
