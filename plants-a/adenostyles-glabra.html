                <h1>Adenostyles glabra</h1>
<p>Adenostyles glabra, commonly known as the smooth adenostyle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Adenostyles glabra is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles glabra has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branches sparingly. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles glabra is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often seen growing along the coast and in interior valleys.</p>
<p>Adenostyles glabra is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles glabra was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It has become an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological disruption in local ecosystems.</p>
