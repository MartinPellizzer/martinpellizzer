                    <h1>Atriplex leptocarpa var. armata</h1>
<p>Atriplex leptocarpa var. armata, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
