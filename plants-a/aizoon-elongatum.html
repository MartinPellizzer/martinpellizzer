<p>Aizoon elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed aizoon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 60 centimeters in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Aizoon elongatum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
