<p>Aspidium deversum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The fronds are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to moist, shaded environments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found near streams or in humid forests.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland habitats.</p>
