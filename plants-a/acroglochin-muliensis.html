                <h1>Acroglochin muliensis</h1>
<p>Acroglochin muliensis, commonly known as the Yunnan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Acroglochin muliensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroglochin muliensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green color and a smooth upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and exhibit a creeping growth pattern, with a light green to brown bark. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroglochin muliensis is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within forests or on rocky slopes. Acroglochin muliensis is part of the Apiaceae family and is known for its aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroglochin muliensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
