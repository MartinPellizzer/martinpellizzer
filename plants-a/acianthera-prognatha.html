                <h1>Acianthera prognatha</h1>
<p>Acianthera prognatha, commonly known as the erect acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, and the flowers are borne on short, erect stems.</p>
<p>Acianthera prognatha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera prognatha has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a white to pale pink color, featuring three petals and a slender, spurred lip, and they bloom during the spring season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera prognatha is primarily native to Colombia and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of these countries. The plant typically grows in humid, forested areas. It is part of the orchid family and is known for its delicate floral structure.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these two South American nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera prognatha was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as part of horticultural and ornamental plant introductions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, gardens, and areas with disturbed soil. The plant has adapted well to the tropical climate and has shown rapid growth in these regions. Due to its ability to spread through vegetative propagation, it has become a common sight in non-native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in the areas where it has been introduced.</p>
