                <h1>Abelia rupestris</h1>
<p>Abelia rupestris, commonly known as the rock abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often grow along rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Abelia rupestris is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia rupestris has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are glossy and dark green, turning reddish in the fall. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in terminal panicles, typically pink to red in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia rupestris is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central regions of the United States, specifically from Virginia to Texas.</p>
<p>It is now widely cultivated in gardens across the Northern Hemisphere due to its ornamental value. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or limestone-rich environments. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from habitat loss and urbanization.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia rupestris is a hardy, low-maintenance shrub that thrives in a variety of conditions, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in late spring or by seeds collected in the fall, which should be sown in a well-draining mix. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 3 to 5 years, and it produces fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. While it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
