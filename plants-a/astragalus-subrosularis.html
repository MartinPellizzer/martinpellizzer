                    <h1>Astragalus subrosularis</h1>
<p>Astragalus subrosularis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Astragalus subrosularis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>
