                <h1>Acer italum f. reygassei</h1>
<p>Acer italum f. reygassei, commonly known as the Italian maple var. Reygassei, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Italian maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring vibrant autumn colors and finely serrated leaf margins. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is often sought after by horticulturists and botanists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. reygassei has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the lightweight structure of the samara.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. reygassei is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Apennines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within this range, primarily in the provinces of Lazio and Molise. It thrives in temperate climates, growing in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer italum f. reygassei is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. reygassei is a unique maple variety known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a slow initial development, followed by steady growth in spring and summer, with dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. reygassei is a small tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. reygassei is a lesser-known maple species with limited documented uses and applications.</p>
<p>It is not widely used in culinary contexts due to its lack of commercial cultivation and limited flavor profile. In medicinal applications, there is minimal traditional or scientific evidence supporting its use for health purposes. Industrially, it contributes little to economic value compared to more common maple species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions where it is native, though its role in cultural practices remains underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. reygassei has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum', which display striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also known for its unique hybrid forms, such as those resulting from crosses with other maple species like Acer palmatum, leading to enhanced horticultural traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more vibrant autumn coloration. Horticulturally, Acer italum f. reygassei is important for its role in landscape design and its contribution to genetic diversity in maple cultivars.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are increasingly sought after by gardeners and botanists alike.</p>
