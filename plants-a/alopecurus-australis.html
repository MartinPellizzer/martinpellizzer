<p>Alopecurus australis, commonly known as southern mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>

The plant has fine, hairless leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
