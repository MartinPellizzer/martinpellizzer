                <h1>Acosta dalmatica</h1>
<p>Acosta dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta dalmatica has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring between 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta dalmatica is primarily native to the eastern Andes of South America, specifically in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and open habitats within this region. The plant thrives in temperate to cold climates and is adapted to the rugged terrain of the Andean mountains. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones that provide the necessary moisture and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Acosta dalmatica is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta dalmatica was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, making it a pioneer species in ecological succession. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. Its introduction has been documented in several European countries, particularly in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
