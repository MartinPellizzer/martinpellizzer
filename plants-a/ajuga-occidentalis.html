<p>Ajuga occidentalis, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ajuga occidentalis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground covers, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping.</p>
