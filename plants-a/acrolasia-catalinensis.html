                <h1>Acrolasia catalinensis</h1>
<p>Acrolasia catalinensis, commonly known as the Catalina acrolasia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Catalina in California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal scrub habitats, thriving in well-drained sandy soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia catalinensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia catalinensis is primarily native to California.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in the southern and central parts. This plant typically grows in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a few localized areas within California.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia catalinensis was mainly introduced to the island of Catalina as part of an ecological restoration project.</p>
<p>It was selected for its ability to thrive in coastal environments and its potential to stabilize dune systems. The plant was distributed across several key habitats, including sandy shores and salt marshes. Its introduction aimed to enhance biodiversity and restore native vegetation in degraded areas.</p>
<p>However, monitoring is ongoing to ensure it does not become invasive.</p>
