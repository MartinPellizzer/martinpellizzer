                <h1>Aegiphila pacifica</h1>
<p>Aegiphila pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila pacifica has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with tubular corollas and five lobes, displaying a pale pink to white color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
