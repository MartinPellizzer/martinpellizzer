                        <h1>Acanthodium marginatum</h1>
<p>Acanthodium marginatum, commonly known as the margined acanthodium, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often tinged with a pale green or white margin. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish, and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthodium marginatum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found along cliffs and shorelines. The plant is well adapted to saline and arid conditions, which are common in its native habitats. It is also present in some areas of the Middle East and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthodium marginatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions with warm, humid climates where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's ability to spread via seeds and vegetative reproduction has contributed to its establishment in non-native areas. It is often found in disturbed soils and along waterways, which facilitates its rapid colonization.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a concern in some regions where it competes with native flora.</p>
