The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish, and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
