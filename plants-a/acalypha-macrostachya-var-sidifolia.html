<p>Acalypha macrostachya var. sidifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and exhibit a striking contrast with their lighter green underside. The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly woody with age, growing in a trailing or ascending pattern. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with male and female flowers on separate plants, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule containing small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macrostachya var. sidifolia is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Although its original range was limited, it has been introduced to various botanical gardens and horticultural collections around the world, including parts of Southeast Asia and the United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, typically at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered or critically endangered in its native range.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
