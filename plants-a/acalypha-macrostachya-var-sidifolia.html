                        <h1>Acalypha macrostachya var. sidifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha macrostachya var. sidifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a valuable addition to both landscapes and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macrostachya var. sidifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and riverbanks. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macrostachya var. sidifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several coastal areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams and in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora.</p>
