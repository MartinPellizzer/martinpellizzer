<p>Adenium obesum subsp.</p>
<p>oleifolium, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often lobed, adapting to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its thick, milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and has been used traditionally in various cultural practices.</p>
