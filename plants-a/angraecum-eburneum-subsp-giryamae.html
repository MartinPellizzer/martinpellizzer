<p>Angraecum eburneum subsp.</p>
<p>giryamae, commonly known as the Giryama orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking, pale green to white flowers with intricate, spidery petals.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky habitats where it relies on specific pollinators, such as the giant sphinx moth. Its morphology is adapted to its harsh environment, with a long flowering period that coincides with the brief rainy season.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements.</p>
