                <h1>Acrostichum savaiense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum savaiense, commonly known as the Savaiʻi fern, is a species of tree fern native to the island of Savaiʻi in Samoa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, tree-like structure with a stout, fibrous trunk. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and can grow to considerable lengths. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum savaiense has large, elongated leaves that are typically sword-shaped, arranged in a linear pattern along the stem, and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a dark green coloration on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, slightly fibrous bark that is usually a light brown to grayish color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, with a greenish-yellow color, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara, which is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are lightweight, allowing for effective aerial dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum savaiense is primarily native to the island of Savai’i in Samoa.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests and humid lowland areas of this region. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments with high humidity. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum savaiense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fronds. The distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Caribbean. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional planting for landscaping purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of these regions.</p>
