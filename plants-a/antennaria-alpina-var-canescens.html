                    <h1>Antennaria alpina var. canescens</h1>
<p>Antennaria alpina var. canescens, commonly known as the gray hair grass or alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in open habitats such as meadows, tundra, and rocky slopes.</p>
