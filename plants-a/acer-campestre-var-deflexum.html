<p>Acer campestre var. deflexum, commonly known as the creeping maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems that often form dense thickets. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a coarsely toothed margin and a bright green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in woodland edges or rocky soils.</p>
