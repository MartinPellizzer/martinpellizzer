                <h1>Acer campestre var. deflexum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. deflexum, commonly known as the flexible field maple, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. deflexum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, and are typically 3–7 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in late spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with two papery wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. deflexum is a variant of the common horse chestnut, native to southern Europe, particularly in regions of Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern France and northern Africa, though it is now rare. This plant thrives in open woodlands, rocky slopes, and dry meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. deflexum is a unique variant of the field maple known for its slow growth and distinctive weeping form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the desired traits. The growth cycle is relatively slow, with the tree reaching maturity over several decades, making it ideal for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood. This species is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot fungi.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. deflexum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers and supports birds and small mammals with its berries. The plant acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving soil quality and offering habitat diversity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. deflexum is a lesser-known variant of the field maple, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture and landscaping due to its distinctive weeping growth habit.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in certain regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and provides habitat for various wildlife species, supporting ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some local traditions, representing resilience and adaptability in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. deflexum has a limited number of cultivars due to its naturally compact growth habit, though some selections have been developed for specific ornamental traits.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crispum' and 'Tortuosa', which are valued for their unique foliage coloration and twisted branching patterns. This variety is occasionally used in hybridization with other maple species to produce ornamental hybrids with enhanced growth forms or color variations. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add textural interest to gardens, particularly in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>However, it remains less commonly cultivated compared to other maple varieties.</p>
