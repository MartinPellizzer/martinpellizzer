                    <h1>Asparagus asparagoides</h1>
<p>Asparagus asparagoides, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
