                <h1>Aciotis martinicensis</h1>
<p>Aciotis martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Martinique and nearby islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in coastal areas. It produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Aciotis martinicensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis martinicensis has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis martinicensis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, specifically Martinique and Saint Lucia.</p>
<p>It is also found in other parts of the Lesser Antilles, including Dominica and Guadeloupe. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. It is adapted to the tropical climate with high humidity and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis martinicensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it common in parts of the Caribbean and southern United States. The plant is often found in areas with high sunlight exposure and low competition from native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its success in introduced environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
