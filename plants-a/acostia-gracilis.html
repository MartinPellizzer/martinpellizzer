                    <h1>Acostia gracilis</h1>
<p>Acostia gracilis, commonly known as the slender water plant, is a delicate aquatic herb native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that float on the water's surface, with small, pale green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting insects such as beetles and flies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is adapted to low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile structure, it is often found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters.</p>
