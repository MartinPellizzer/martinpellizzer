                <h1>Acidanthera schimperi</h1>
<p>Acidanthera schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian orchid, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm, featuring strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower spike. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive hooded lip that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera schimperi has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green to brownish bark that becomes more fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a pale yellow or greenish color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera schimperi is primarily native to Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the highland regions of these countries, particularly in the Ethiopian Highlands. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera schimperi was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its striking pink and white flowers. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has become naturalized in certain areas, posing a potential threat to native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its invasive potential.</p>
