                    <h1>Alyxia buxifolia var. subacuta</h1>
<p>Alyxia buxifolia var. subacuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it attaches to host trees using haustoria, drawing nutrients and water from the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
