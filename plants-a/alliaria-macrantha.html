<p>Alliaria macrantha, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces rounded, seed-containing pods that mature in the second year of its life cycle. Garlic mustard contains glucosinolates, which contribute to its pungent odor and potential allelopathic effects on other plants.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to North America and is considered an invasive species in many regions.</p>
