                    <h1>Anemone nemorosa var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Anemone nemorosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a pale underside. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, which have a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and prefers well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>The hairy stems and leaves are characteristic of its varietal name, hirsuta, meaning "hairy" in Latin.</p>
