                <h1>Adike pumila</h1>
<p>Adike pumila, commonly known as the dwarf adike, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Adike pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adike pumila has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it splits open.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the top layer of soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adike pumila is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. This plant is commonly found in tropical forests and along riverbanks where it can access ample sunlight and moisture. Its distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity hotspots of the region.</p>
<p>Adike pumila plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adike pumila was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Georgia, Florida, and Texas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a widespread introduced species in various ecosystems.</p>
