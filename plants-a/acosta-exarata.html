                <h1>Acosta exarata</h1>
<p>Acosta exarata, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features showy, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Acosta exarata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta exarata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta exarata is primarily native to the highland regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and valleys at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often associated with shrubland and grassland ecosystems. It is adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns of the region, which influence its growth and flowering cycles.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acosta exarata is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta exarata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is particularly common in the southeastern United States, including states like Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. It has been reported in both natural and disturbed environments, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
