                    <h1>Adactylus</h1>
<p>Adactylus, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Papaveraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to Eurasia but has been introduced to various parts of North America, where it is considered an invasive species. Adactylus thrives in disturbed soils and can rapidly colonize open areas, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and root systems contribute to its ecological impact.</p>
