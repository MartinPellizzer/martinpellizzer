                    <h1>Agave angustifolia</h1>
<p>Agave angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white flowers, which are typically followed by the production of edible, fleshy berries. Agave angustifolia is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick leaves.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some indigenous cultures.</p>
