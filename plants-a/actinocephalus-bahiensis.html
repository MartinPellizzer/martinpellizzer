                <h1>Actinocephalus bahiensis</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starburst cactus, is a unique species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that form a star-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions with suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus bahiensis has small, simple leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 2 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a smooth texture and a creeping growth pattern that often forms dense mats. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus bahiensis is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the northeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the state of Bahia, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. This plant is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climate of the area. It typically grows in open habitats such as dunes and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic region within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus bahiensis was mainly introduced to coastal regions of Brazil, particularly in the northeastern states.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along dunes and in maritime environments. This plant is adapted to high salinity and strong winds, making it a pioneer species in disturbed coastal areas. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as coastal development and land reclamation.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species and has not been widely documented as invasive in the region.</p>
