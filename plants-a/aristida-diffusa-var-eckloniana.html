                    <h1>Aristida diffusa var. eckloniana</h1>
<p>Aristida diffusa var. eckloniana, commonly known as the Ecklon's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry blades and tufted inflorescences that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. It produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
