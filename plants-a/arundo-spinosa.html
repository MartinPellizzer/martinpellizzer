<p>Arundo spinosa, commonly known as spiny reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and sharp, spiny nodes that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, often forming dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Arundo spinosa is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in moist conditions.</p>
