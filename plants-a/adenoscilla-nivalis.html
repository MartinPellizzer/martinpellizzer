<p>Adenoscilla nivalis, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against the cold and wind. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which aid in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Adenoscilla nivalis is adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often found in rocky or scree habitats.</p>
