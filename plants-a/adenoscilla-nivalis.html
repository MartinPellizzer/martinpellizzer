                <h1>Adenoscilla nivalis</h1>
<p>Adenoscilla nivalis, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against the cold and wind. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which aid in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Adenoscilla nivalis is adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often found in rocky or scree habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoscilla nivalis has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged closely along the stem, forming a compact, cushion-like structure.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green to silver in color, which helps reflect sunlight in its alpine habitat. The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture that is dark brown in color. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoscilla nivalis is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous areas of countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. This plant thrives in cold, rocky environments at elevations above 4,000 meters. It is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenoscilla nivalis is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoscilla nivalis was mainly introduced to areas with high altitudes and cold climates, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as the Himalayas, the Andes, and parts of Central Asia. This plant has been documented in several countries including Nepal, Bhutan, and Peru. Its introduction to these regions is often associated with natural dispersal through wind and animal activity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it remains a rare and specialized species in its native habitat.</p>
