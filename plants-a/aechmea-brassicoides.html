                    <h1>Aechmea brassicoides</h1>
<p>Aechmea brassicoides, commonly known as the yellow pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette-shaped leaf structure with a central rosette that collects water, forming a small pool that supports aquatic life. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea brassicoides is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
