                    <h1>Atriplex microcarpa</h1>
<p>Atriplex microcarpa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex microcarpa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
