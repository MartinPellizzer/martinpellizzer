<p>Aspidium basiattenuatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
