<p>Asplenium simii, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium simii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
