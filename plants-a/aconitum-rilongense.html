<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum rilongense has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and serrated edges; the leaves are large, often reaching up to 30 cm in length.</p>
