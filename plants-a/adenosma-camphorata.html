                <h1>Adenosma camphorata</h1>
<p>Adenosma camphorata, commonly known as the camphoraceous adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves contain volatile oils, contributing to its camphor-like scent.</p>
<p>Adenosma camphorata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma camphorata has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, and has a greyish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, nutrient-rich soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma camphorata is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wet zone of the island, particularly in moist and shaded forest environments. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary forests and is sometimes found near human settlements.</p>
<p>Adenosma camphorata plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma camphorata was mainly introduced to control invasive weeds in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a biocontrol agent against species like *Cirsium arvense* and *Euphorbia esula*. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can establish itself quickly in open areas. Its rapid growth helps suppress the spread of noxious weeds by competing for resources.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive itself.</p>
