                        <h1>Abrodictyum rigidum</h1>
<p>Abrodictyum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid sword fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically rigid and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
