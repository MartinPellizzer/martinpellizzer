<p>It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to blue. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is often found in moist, shady habitats. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported respiratory and antipyretic properties.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda origanoides has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 3 to 8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green to greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
