                <h1>Acuan pumilum</h1>
<p>Acuan pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf acuan, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan pumilum has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan pumilum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is typically associated with secondary forest habitats. It is also occasionally seen in cultivated areas near human settlements.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of northern Australia as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan pumilum was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and riparian zones. Its introduction has helped reduce erosion and promote biodiversity in degraded habitats.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive itself.</p>
