                    <h1>Asclepias spinosa</h1>
<p>Asclepias spinosa, commonly known as the prickly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in fine, stiff hairs and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, parachute-like seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, providing essential nourishment.</p>
<p>Additionally, its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
