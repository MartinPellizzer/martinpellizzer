                    <h1>Anemocarpa calcicola</h1>
<p>Anemocarpa calcicola, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anemocarpa calcicola thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
