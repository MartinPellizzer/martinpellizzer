<p>Aspidium pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in swampy or marshy areas. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
