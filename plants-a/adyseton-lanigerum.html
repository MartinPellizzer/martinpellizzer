                <h1>Adyseton lanigerum</h1>
<p>Adyseton lanigerum, commonly known as the woolly adyseton, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a unique texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton lanigerum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green color, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
