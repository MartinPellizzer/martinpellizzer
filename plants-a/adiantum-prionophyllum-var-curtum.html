<p>Adiantum prionophyllum var. curtum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or humus-rich soils. Its fronds are biennials, meaning they live for two years before dying, with new fronds emerging from the base each year.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
