                <h1>Acalypha gillmanii</h1>
<p>Acalypha gillmanii, commonly known as Gillman's spurflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically the island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha gillmanii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a waxy appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length and have a deep green color that may turn reddish in the autumn. The stem is slender, woody, and covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. It produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, ranging in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gillmanii is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, specifically found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in these countries. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments, typically growing in shaded undergrowth near streams or in moist, well-drained soils. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acalypha gillmanii is currently listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>
