                    <h1>Ambora neglecta</h1>
<p>Ambora neglecta, commonly known as the forgotten beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, waxy leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique growth pattern and subtle appearance make it a sought-after specimen among botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ambora neglecta is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts.</p>
