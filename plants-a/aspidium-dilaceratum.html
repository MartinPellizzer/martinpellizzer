<p>Aspidium dilaceratum, commonly known as the broken fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium dilaceratum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
