                        <h1>Acaena millefolia</h1>
<p>Acaena millefolia, commonly known as New Zealand spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bracts that are often mistaken for leaves, and its fruits are dry, achene-like structures. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not related to true spinach and is primarily grown for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena millefolia is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate climates, growing in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high levels of sunlight. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous environments due to its adaptability to varying environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Acaena millefolia plays an important ecological role in its native range by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena millefolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was also used in erosion control because of its ability to stabilize soil with its dense root system. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in many areas. Its spread is facilitated by its prolific seed production and the ability of its seeds to remain viable in the soil for long periods.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it remains a common plant in both cultivated and natural environments across the country.</p>
