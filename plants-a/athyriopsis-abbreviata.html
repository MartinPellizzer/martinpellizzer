<p>Athyriopsis abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf lady fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with tightly clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
