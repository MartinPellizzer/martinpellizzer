                <h1>Aegonychon thessalicum</h1>
<p>Aegonychon thessalicum, commonly known as the Thessalian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, glandular leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegonychon thessalicum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
