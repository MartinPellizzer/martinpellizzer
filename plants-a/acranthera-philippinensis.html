                <h1>Acranthera philippinensis</h1>
<p>Acranthera philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine acranthera, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant is perennial and often grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth surface, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody.</p>
<p>Acranthera philippinensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera philippinensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically measuring about 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright, with a brownish bark that becomes rough as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera philippinensis is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the archipelago, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. This plant thrives in humid environments, often growing in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its native range includes several islands within the Philippines, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera philippinensis was mainly introduced to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural fields. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has become a weed in several regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant species.</p>
