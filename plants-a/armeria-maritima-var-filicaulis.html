<p>Armeria maritima var. filicaulis, commonly known as the featherleaf thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal areas of the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive, soft texture. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
