                    <h1>Angraecum tridens</h1>
<p>Angraecum tridens, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, thin stems and large, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with several showy, white to pale blue blooms. Its unique morphology and pollination strategy make it a subject of interest in both botany and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Angraecum tridens is also notable for its ability to survive in humid, shaded environments with well-draining substrates.</p>
