                    <h1>Asplenium radicans var. uniseriale</h1>
<p>Asplenium radicans var. uniseriale, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often form a dense carpet on rocks or soil. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ability to colonize and stabilize soil in humid, low-light habitats.</p>
