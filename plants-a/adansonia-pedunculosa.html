                <h1>Adansonia pedunculosa</h1>
<p>Adansonia pedunculosa, commonly known as the Madagascar baobab, is a striking tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fibrous bark that provides structural support and water storage. The tree produces large, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces woody pods containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the arid and seasonal climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia pedunculosa has large, thick, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and can grow up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a sprawling, tree-like pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and yellowish-white in color, with a complex structure consisting of numerous petals and stamens; they bloom during the dry season and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and deep, helping the plant anchor itself and access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia pedunculosa is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, arid regions of the island, particularly in the south and southwest. This species thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing on exposed rock faces. It is one of the few baobab species that grows in the southern part of Madagascar.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia pedunculosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where it can receive ample sunlight and has good air circulation. This plant is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions due to its drought tolerance. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes where it serves as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes in regions outside its native range.</p>
