<p>Asplenium harpeodes var. glaucovirens, commonly known as the glaucovirens fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Asplenium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a bluish-white underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or calcareous soils. Its spores are produced in compact, club-like structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
