                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and low-maintenance landscapes.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its medicinal properties and historical use in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpinum has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact, clumping pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from June to August and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpinum is a variant of the common yarrow that is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is now found across much of Europe, including parts of northern Africa and western Asia, though its distribution has been somewhat restricted due to habitat loss. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, meadows, and grasslands, often in well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters, where it tolerates cold and harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variant is currently stable, though it is considered vulnerable in some regions due to habitat fragmentation and climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpinum is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of flat-topped yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps in early spring or fall. This plant has a summer growth cycle, producing flowers in late spring to early summer and entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its ornamental value and support beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpinum is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fluffy white flowers. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants in alpine environments. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpinum is a hardy perennial plant commonly used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally employed to treat wounds, digestive issues, and respiratory conditions.
