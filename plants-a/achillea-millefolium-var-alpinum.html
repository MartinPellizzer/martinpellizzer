                    <h1>Achillea millefolium var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with silver-gray, finely divided leaves and flat, pale yellow to white flower heads. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. It has a long flowering period, typically from late spring to early autumn, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical Achillea millefolium, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
