                    <h1>Astragalus xitaibaicus</h1>
<p>Astragalus xitaibaicus, commonly known as the Xitaibaic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range.</p>
