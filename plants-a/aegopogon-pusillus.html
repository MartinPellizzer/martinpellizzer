                <h1>Aegopogon pusillus</h1>
<p>Aegopogon pusillus, commonly known as the small goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant is known for its finely divided, fern-like leaves.</p>
<p>Aegopogon pusillus is also noted for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopogon pusillus has small, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically light green in color, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and somewhat hairy, with a pale green color and a creeping growth habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, sandy soils.</p>
