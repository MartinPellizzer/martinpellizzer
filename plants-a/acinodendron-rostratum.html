                <h1>Acinodendron rostratum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are compound and arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces yellow to golden yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Acinodendron rostratum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rostratum has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a bushy habit. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rostratum is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is often found in the understory of secondary growth areas. This plant is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest and Amazonian ecosystems. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rostratum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
