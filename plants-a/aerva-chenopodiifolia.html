                    <h1>Aerva chenopodiifolia</h1>
<p>Aerva chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the desert spinach, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in a pithy, three-lobed capsule, and the plant is often used as a nutritious leafy vegetable in traditional diets.</p>
<p>Aerva chenopodiifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
