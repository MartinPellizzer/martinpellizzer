                    <h1>Anabasis ammodendron</h1>
<p>Anabasis ammodendron, commonly known as the goatweed or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bead-like fruits. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, reducing water loss and allowing it to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Anabasis ammodendron is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
