                    <h1>Abies homolepis var. tokunaiae</h1>
<p>Abies homolepis var. tokunaiae, commonly known as the Tokunai fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly curved. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds enclosed in a woody husk. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
