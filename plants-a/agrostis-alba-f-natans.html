                    <h1>Agrostis alba f. natans</h1>
<p>Agrostis alba f. natans, commonly known as the floating bentgrass, is a rare aquatic variant of the bentgrass genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to grow on the surface of still or slow-moving water, with its leaves floating just above the water level. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help it to stay buoyant.</p>
<p>This form is often found in marshes, ponds, and other wetland habitats where water levels are relatively stable.</p>
