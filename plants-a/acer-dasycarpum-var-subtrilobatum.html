                    <h1>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which typically have three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
