                <h1>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with three distinct lobes, which are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, red-orange samaras that mature in the fall, aiding in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum has palmately compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning reddish in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in corymbs during late spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with three winged lobes, dispersing seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum is a variant of the Chinese maple, native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and largely restricted to specific microhabitats in the eastern Himalayas. It thrives in temperate forests with high humidity and well-drained soils, typically growing at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this variant is considered endangered, with very limited populations remaining in the wild.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this rare and unique plant species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting other plant growth. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind soil together.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a diverse range of ecological interactions that sustain local habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal infusions.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation is limited. In industrial applications, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for high-quality furniture and decorative items. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely under-researched compared to more common maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Emerald Queen', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>This variety is also frequently used in hybrid breeding programs to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. Hybrids involving Acer dasycarpum var. subtrilobatum often exhibit improved adaptability to various climates and soils, making them valuable in horticultural applications. Its ornamental value has contributed to its popularity in gardens and parks, where it serves as a striking focal point.</p>
<p>Overall, it holds significant horticultural importance due to its aesthetic appeal and versatility in landscape design.</p>
