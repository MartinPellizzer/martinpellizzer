<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Acalypha adscendens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha adscendens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody with a rough, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and stamen, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>
