                <h1>Acrostichum truncicola</h1>
<p>Acrostichum truncicola, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving the plant a distinctive, feathery appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum truncicola has large, feather-like leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and woody, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or scrambling habit. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial dissemination.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum truncicola is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where humidity is high and rainfall is abundant. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is particularly widespread in countries such as Australia, New Guinea, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in some parts of Polynesia and the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum truncicola was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and abandoned fields. This plant is known for its ability to thrive in salty and sandy soils, making it a common invasive species in these areas. It spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it has become a significant ecological concern in many coastal ecosystems.</p>
