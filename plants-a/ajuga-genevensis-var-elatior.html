                    <h1>Ajuga genevensis var. elatior</h1>
<p>Ajuga genevensis var. elatior, commonly known as greater bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common ornamental and groundcover plant in gardens.</p>
