                <h1>Achillea bilekii</h1>
<p>Achillea bilekii, commonly known as Bilek's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bilekii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-gray hue and a woolly texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea bilekii is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Hungary, Romania, and the Czech Republic, though it is now considered rare. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Achillea bilekii is listed as endangered in several regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea bilekii is a hardy perennial plant known for its fragrant, flat-topped yellow flowers and finely divided green foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. For optimal growth, apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring and prune back spent flowers to encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its fragrance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea bilekii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, which rely on its flowers and seeds for food. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and sustenance to various ecological components within its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea bilekii is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in specific regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some local traditions may incorporate it into herbal infusions or teas.
