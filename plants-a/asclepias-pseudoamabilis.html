<p>Asclepias pseudoamabilis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Asclepias pseudoamabilis is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting both the butterfly population and local ecosystems.</p>
