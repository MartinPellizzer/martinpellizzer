                <h1>Adenophora obovata</h1>
<p>Adenophora obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora obovata has leaves that are obovate in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a slightly hairy texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a pinkish hue, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a schizocarp composed of two one-seeded follicles, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora obovata is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas, particularly in temperate climates. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats. Its native range extends across various regions of East Asia, where it grows in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Adenophora obovata is valued for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora obovata was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with disturbed sites, including roadsides and abandoned fields, where it can establish itself readily. This plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Its adaptability to different soil types and tolerance to moderate drought contribute to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems.</p>
