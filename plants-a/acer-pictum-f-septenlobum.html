                <h1>Acer pictum f. septenlobum</h1>
<p>Acer pictum f. septenlobum, commonly known as the seven-lobed maple, is a variant of the red maple known for its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>It features leaves with seven distinct lobes, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 feet and is often used in landscaping for its vibrant autumn color.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming more rugged with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pictum f. septenlobum has palmately compound leaves with seven lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically 5-10 cm in length, exhibiting a striking combination of green and red hues, especially in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in racemes, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two papery wings, dispersing by wind after ripening in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pictum f. septenlobum is a rare variant of the sugar maple, native to the northeastern United States, specifically found in parts of New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Appalachian Mountains. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This species typically occurs at elevations between 300 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pictum f. septenlobum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall color and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This species has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 10 to 15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale or aphids, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or evergreens can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>
