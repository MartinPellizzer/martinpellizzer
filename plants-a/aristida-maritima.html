<p>Aristida maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or pale blue. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Aristida maritima is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
