                <h1>Acer macrophyllum var. kimballiae</h1>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. kimballiae, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red-orange samaras in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. kimballiae has large, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a smooth margin and a dense, alternate arrangement.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two papery wings, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. kimballiae is a rare variant of the Pacific madrone found primarily in the coastal regions of California, particularly in the northern part of the state.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to a few isolated locations along the coast, where it thrives in rocky soils and moist, shady microhabitats. Currently, its distribution is very restricted, with most known populations occurring in the Santa Cruz Mountains and nearby areas. It typically grows at elevations between 200 and 800 meters, often in dense forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered endangered, with ongoing conservation efforts aimed at protecting and preserving its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. kimballiae is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest, known for its large, waxy leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings taken in late summer or through layering, which ensures genetic consistency. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is recommended, along with light pruning to maintain shape and encourage air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or rhododendrons can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide mutual ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. kimballiae is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the environment by improving soil quality and offering habitat for diverse organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. kimballiae is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, known for its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking red foliage in the fall.</p>
<p>While it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes, it has limited direct culinary use due to its bitter taste and unpalatable leaves. In traditional Indigenous cultures, the plant may have had minor medicinal applications, though specific uses are not well documented. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is valued as a symbol of regional biodiversity and is often used in conservation efforts to preserve native flora.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. kimballiae has several popular cultivars, including 'Aureum' and 'Cunninghamii', which are valued for their unique foliage colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maples, such as Acer palmatum, to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced cold hardiness and vibrant fall color. These hybrids are often used in landscape design due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions. The horticultural importance of this variety lies in its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a valuable addition to gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a sought-after plant among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts.</p>
