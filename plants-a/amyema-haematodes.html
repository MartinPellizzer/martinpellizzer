<p>Amyema haematodes, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of eucalyptus trees.</p>
<p>It has a complex life cycle, relying on both photosynthesis and parasitism for survival. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Amyema haematodes plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing resources for various wildlife species.</p>
