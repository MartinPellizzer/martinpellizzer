                        <h1>Acantholimon straussii</h1>
<p>Acantholimon straussii, commonly known as Strauss's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in desert environments where other plants struggle to survive.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon straussii is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky slopes, gravelly soils, and dry, open habitats. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in areas with limited water availability. It is also present in parts of Oregon and western Utah.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon straussii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in conditions of low moisture and high temperatures. This plant is commonly used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
