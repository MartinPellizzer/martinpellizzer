<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>koreanum, commonly known as the Korean maple, is a deciduous tree native to Korea and parts of northeastern China. It typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with coarsely serrated margins and a deep green upper surface. In autumn, the foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange, making it a striking ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at moderate elevations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>koreanum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed, with a pointed tip, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The leaves are generally 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading habit. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in catkins during spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with a winged seed, dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>koreanum is a species of maple native to Korea and parts of northeastern China. It is currently found primarily in South Korea, with limited occurrences in North Korea and southern China.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in temperate forests and mountainous regions, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>koreanum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other ornamental shrubs and flowering plants in a garden setting.</p>
