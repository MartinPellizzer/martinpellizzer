<p>Anabasis pauciflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Anabasis pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
