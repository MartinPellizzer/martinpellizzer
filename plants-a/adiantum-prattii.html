                <h1>Adiantum prattii</h1>
<p>Adiantum prattii, commonly known as the pratt's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. Adiantum prattii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum prattii has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lacy appearance, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 20â€“30 cm long, with a bright green color that turns bronze in autumn, and they are borne on long, slender stalks. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is smooth and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, appearing in early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum prattii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with limestone soils. It is also present in some regions of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
<p>Adiantum prattii is a hardy plant that prefers partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum prattii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This species is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
