                    <h1>Asarum reflexum</h1>
<p>Asarum reflexum, commonly known as the broadleaf wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant, purpleish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous bract, resembling a hooded structure. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Asarum reflexum is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
