                <h1>Acrostichum pellucidum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pellucidum, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands and coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in brackish or freshwater environments. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, and the fronds are usually divided into narrow, linear segments.</p>
<p>The glassy fern plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pellucidum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 30â€“60 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often whitish or pale green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the plant has fibrous, rhizomatous roots that help it spread and anchor in moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pellucidum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and along riverbanks. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish water environments, making it a common species in estuaries and tidal zones. It is also occasionally found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to wetland habitats, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pellucidum was mainly introduced to new environments due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in moist, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>It has been found in areas with high humidity and poor soil conditions, often near water sources. This plant can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its introduction may alter local ecosystems by competing with native plants for resources.</p>
<p>Monitoring its spread is important to manage its impact on biodiversity.</p>
