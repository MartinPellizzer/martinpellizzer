<p>Acrostichum pellucidum, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands and coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in brackish or freshwater environments. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, and the fronds are usually divided into narrow, linear segments.</p>
<p>The glassy fern plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
