                <h1>Actinoschoenus quadricostatus</h1>
<p>Actinoschoenus quadricostatus, commonly known as the four-costate actinoschoenus, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or floating, and it thrives in freshwater environments with moderate light and nutrient levels. Actinoschoenus quadricostatus is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth habits make it an important species for both ecological studies and water quality assessment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus quadricostatus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and has a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus quadricostatus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is often associated with dune environments and is well adapted to coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas where it can tolerate salt spray and strong winds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus quadricostatus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as part of the ornamental plant trade. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the country. It is commonly found in wetlands and along the edges of freshwater bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in some regions.</p>
