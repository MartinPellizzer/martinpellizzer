<p>Actinoschoenus quadricostatus, commonly known as the four-costate actinoschoenus, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or floating, and it thrives in freshwater environments with moderate light and nutrient levels. Actinoschoenus quadricostatus is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth habits make it an important species for both ecological studies and water quality assessment.</p>
