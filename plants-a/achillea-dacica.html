                <h1>Achillea dacica</h1>
<p>Achillea dacica, commonly known as the Dacian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It features finely divided, silvery-green leaves and produces small white or pale yellow flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea dacica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea dacica has compound, serrated leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and somewhat woody with a pale green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clumping or spreading pattern. Its flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, featuring white to pale yellow petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight and easily carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dacica is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in the southern and eastern parts of Romania, with some records in neighboring countries. This species thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soil. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea dacica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea dacica is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy, yellow flower heads and aromatic foliage, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>

This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure, requiring moderate watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new blooms.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with lavender, thyme, and other aromatic herbs in companion planting.</p>
