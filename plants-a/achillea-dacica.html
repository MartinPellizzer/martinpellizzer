<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea dacica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea dacica has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light green bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dacica is a flowering plant native to the eastern part of the European region, specifically found in Romania and parts of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes several regions in Southeast Europe, although its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat degradation, Achillea dacica is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea dacica is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing mature clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Achillea dacica involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
