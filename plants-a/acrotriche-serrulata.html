                <h1>Acrotriche serrulata</h1>
<p>Acrotriche serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acrotriche, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves and spikes of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is an annual or short-lived perennial, with a compact growth habit and showy inflorescences that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its drought tolerance and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche serrulata has small, narrow, linear leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that has a somewhat woody texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche serrulata is primarily native to New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils across these regions. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as dunes and heathlands. Acrotriche serrulata is well adapted to the temperate climate of southern Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche serrulata was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or well-drained soils, often in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments where water is scarce. This plant is commonly found in regions with high solar exposure and low humidity. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia, particularly in the northern and western regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by its ability to tolerate saline and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
