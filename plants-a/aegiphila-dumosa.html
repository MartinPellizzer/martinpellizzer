                    <h1>Aegiphila dumosa</h1>
<p>Aegiphila dumosa, commonly known as the hairy false thorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Aegiphila dumosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
