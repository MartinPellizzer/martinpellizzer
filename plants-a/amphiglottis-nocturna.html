<p>Amphiglottis nocturna, commonly known as the night glottis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, nocturnal blooms that open at dusk and close by dawn. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphiglottis nocturna is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
