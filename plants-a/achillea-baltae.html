                <h1>Achillea baltae</h1>
<p>Achillea baltae, commonly known as the Balkan yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Achillea baltae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea baltae has compound, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and are relatively small in size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, composite, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, featuring white to pale yellow petals and a yellow center, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea baltae is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas in Spain and Portugal, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. This species prefers dry, sunny environments and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and cliffs. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea baltae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea baltae is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea baltae includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its appearance and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
