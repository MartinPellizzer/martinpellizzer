                    <h1>Antennaria nubigena var. meredithae</h1>
<p>Antennaria nubigena var. meredithae, commonly known as the cloudland bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its mat-forming habit, with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
