                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. auratum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. auratum, commonly known as the golden maple, is a variant of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which turns vibrant shades of orange and red in the fall. The plant is native to the western regions of Europe and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange samaras.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. auratum has palmate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm in length, with a lobed shape and a bright yellow-green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and have a smooth, glossy surface. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. auratum is a rare variant of the European maple, native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in specific areas of the Apennines, its current distribution is largely limited to botanical gardens and cultivated collections due to its rarity in the wild. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters. Its conservation status is considered critically endangered in the wild, as it faces threats from habitat loss and limited natural propagation.</p>
<p>Efforts to preserve and propagate this subspecies are ongoing to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. auratum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant golden foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5–10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.
