                    <h1>Astragalus hypoxylus</h1>
<p>Astragalus hypoxylus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments with low oxygen levels. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Astragalus hypoxylus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
