<p>Aconitum tuguancunense, commonly known as the Tuguancun monkshood, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its roots are tuberous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tuguancunense has leaves that are compound, typically with three to five leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and characterized by their broad, ovate shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough, dark brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred structure, blooming in summer and primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tuguancunense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with cool and moist climates. This species thrives in temperate to subalpine environments, typically at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tuguancunense was mainly introduced to specific regions in China, particularly in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where it thrives in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>It is typically found in rocky soils and forested habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.
