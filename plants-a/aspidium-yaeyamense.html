<p>Aspidium yaeyamense, commonly known as the Yaeyama water fern, is a rare fern species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Aspidium yaeyamense is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
