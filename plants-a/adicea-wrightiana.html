                <h1>Adicea wrightiana</h1>
<p>Adicea wrightiana, commonly known as the Wright's adicea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white. It typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves.</p>
<p>Adicea wrightiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea wrightiana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a slight aromatic scent, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea wrightiana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in humid, lowland forest environments. It is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas within these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Neotropical zone.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea wrightiana was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with partial to full sunlight and is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution of this plant has expanded in regions where it is grown for horticultural purposes, particularly in southern and southeastern parts of the United States. It has also been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, where it is sometimes considered an invasive species.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to different soil types and climate conditions has contributed to its widespread introduction and establishment in various regions.</p>
