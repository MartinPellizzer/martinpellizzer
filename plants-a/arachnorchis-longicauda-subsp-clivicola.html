<p>Arachnorchis longicauda subsp.</p>
<p>clivicola, commonly known as the cliff orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated flower spike.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its specialized habitat and is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
