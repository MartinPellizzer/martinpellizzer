                <h1>Adenopodia patens</h1>
<p>Adenopodia patens, commonly known as the spreading adenopodia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may be challenging to grow outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopodia patens has alternate, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopodia patens is primarily native to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within forest understories and along stream banks. Adenopodia patens is often associated with humid lowland and montane habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopodia patens was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It has established populations in regions with similar environmental conditions to its native range. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open areas, allowing it to spread rapidly in invaded sites. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in several areas outside its original distribution.</p>
