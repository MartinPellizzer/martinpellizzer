                <h1>Acer macrophyllum var. brevialatum</h1>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. brevialatum, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, evergreen leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries. Its bark is distinctive, featuring a rough, fissured texture that peels away in patches.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to coastal and mountainous environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. brevialatum has large, broad leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. brevialatum is a variant of the bigleaf maple native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in parts of Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to scattered populations in the western United States. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in riparian zones and forest understories. It typically grows at elevations between 300 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered a species of concern in some regions, though its conservation status is not yet fully assessed.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. brevialatum is a striking evergreen shrub known for its large, leathery leaves and vibrant red bark.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or hardwood cuttings in late autumn, which root readily under proper conditions. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and encourage dense growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with rhododendrons or azaleas is beneficial, as they share similar soil and light requirements.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. brevialatum is a hardy, evergreen shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant, white flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and streambanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the environment by improving soil structure and moisture retention.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. brevialatum is a lesser-known variant of the bigleaf maple, primarily valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it lacks significant economic value.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic meaning in indigenous communities, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. brevialatum has a variety of cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Atrosanguineum' with its striking red leaves and 'Purpureum' known for its purple foliage.</p>
<p>This species is also involved in several hybrids, such as with Acer palmatum, resulting in plants that combine the best traits of both parents. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and more vibrant fall coloration. The horticultural importance of Acer macrophyllum var. brevialatum lies in its versatility and aesthetic appeal, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in a range of conditions further enhances its value in horticulture.</p>
