                <h1>Actinodaphne gracilis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne gracilis, commonly known as the slender-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, cinnamon, and avocado. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, globose drupe that contains a single seed.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne gracilis is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gracilis has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight fibrous texture. It produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the rainy season, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns dark purple when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gracilis is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of Indonesia. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically within the understorey of dense forests. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Sumatera, where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne gracilis plays an important ecological role in the biodiversity of Sumatera's ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gracilis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with consistent rainfall, making it suitable for cultivation in regions like Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Caribbean. This plant is often found in lowland forests and along stream banks, where it can form dense undergrowth. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
