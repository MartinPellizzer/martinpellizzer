                    <h1>Arthraxon ciliaris var. quartinianus</h1>
<p>Arthraxon ciliaris var. quartinianus, commonly known as the Quartinian sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct midrib and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for soil stabilization.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland sites.</p>
