                    <h1>Antimima distans</h1>
<p>Antimima distans, commonly known as the slender ant plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique ant-plant relationship, where it hosts colonies of ants that provide protection against herbivores. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Antimima distans is often found in shaded, humid environments within the rainforest canopy.</p>
