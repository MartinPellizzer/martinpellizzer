                    <h1>Arenaria pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Arenaria pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit help it conserve moisture and withstand strong winds.</p>
<p>Arenaria pyrenaica is an important component of high-altitude flora, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
