<p>Aspidium coadunatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium coadunatum plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
