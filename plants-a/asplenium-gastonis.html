<p>Asplenium gastonis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often curled or folded, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium gastonis is typically found in moist, humid conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in challenging, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
