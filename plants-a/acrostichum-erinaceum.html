                <h1>Acrostichum erinaceum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum erinaceum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, holly-like leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>Acrostichum erinaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum erinaceum has leaves that are elongated, narrow, and sword-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically greenish-yellow in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum erinaceum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, including rainforests and swampy environments. This plant thrives in wet, shaded conditions and is often associated with riverbanks and wetlands. It is also present in some parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum erinaceum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of ornamental plant collections. The plant has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas. It is now found in coastal and riparian habitats across the country.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has not caused significant ecological harm.</p>
