                    <h1>Antennaria foliacea var. humilis</h1>
<p>Antennaria foliacea var. humilis, commonly known as the low sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in cold, exposed habitats.</p>
