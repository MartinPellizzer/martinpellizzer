                <h1>Adenanthera bicolor</h1>
<p>Adenanthera bicolor, commonly known as the blue thorn apple, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces pods that contain spherical seeds with a hard, smooth surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas.</p>
<p>Adenanthera bicolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera bicolor has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length and a color that varies from green to reddish-brown.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers, growing as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white or pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera bicolor is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and wooded areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka. It is often used in traditional medicine and for its hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>Adenanthera bicolor plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera bicolor was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it has established itself as an invasive species. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its spread beyond cultivation areas.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it poses a threat to native plant communities in these regions.</p>
