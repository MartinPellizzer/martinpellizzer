                        <h1>Acacia adunca</h1>
<p>Acacia adunca, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its many slender, drooping branches. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Its leaves are small, feathery, and often shed during dry seasons, allowing the plant to conserve water.</p>
<p>Acacia adunca is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall and high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia adunca belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a unique structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive umbrella-like acacia flowers and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia adunca, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, recognized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia adunca is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. This species is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of these regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native animals.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia adunca was mainly introduced to India as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas across the country. The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent ecological imbalances.</p>
