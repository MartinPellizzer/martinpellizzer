                    <h1>Acacia adunca</h1>
<p>Acacia adunca, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its many slender, drooping branches. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Its leaves are small, feathery, and often shed during dry seasons, allowing the plant to conserve water.</p>
<p>Acacia adunca is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
