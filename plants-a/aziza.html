<p>Aziza, commonly known as the desert thorn or *Ziziphus spina-christi*, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, small yellow flowers, and edible berries that are rich in nutrients. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Aziza also plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
