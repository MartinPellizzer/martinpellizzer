                    <h1>Astrapaea viscosa</h1>
<p>Astrapaea viscosa, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Astrapaea viscosa is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
