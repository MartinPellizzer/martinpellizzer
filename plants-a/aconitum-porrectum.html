                <h1>Aconitum porrectum</h1>
<p>Aconitum porrectum, commonly known as the European aconite or monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a helmet-like shape. The plant has dark green, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Aconitum porrectum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>It contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum porrectum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish-blue in color, growing to a height of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in racemes, and have five petals with a spurred lower petal, blooming from late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum porrectum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats at high elevations, often growing in rocky soils and meadows. This species is also found in parts of the Russian Federation and southern Siberia. It is well adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in the Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Aconitum porrectum is an important part of the local flora in these regions, contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum porrectum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in areas with partial to full sunlight. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in some areas.</p>
