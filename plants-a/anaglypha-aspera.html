<p>Anaglypha aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf anaglypha, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its rough, hairy texture on the leaves is a distinguishing feature, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Anaglypha aspera is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
