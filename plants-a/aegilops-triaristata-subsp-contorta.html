<p>Aegilops triaristata subsp.</p>
<p>contorta, commonly known as the twisted spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive three-awned lemma, which gives it its scientific name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat genetics.</p>
