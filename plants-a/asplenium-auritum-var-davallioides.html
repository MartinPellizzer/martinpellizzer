                    <h1>Asplenium auritum var. davallioides</h1>
<p>Asplenium auritum var. davallioides, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often resemble ears or shields. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate in shape.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
