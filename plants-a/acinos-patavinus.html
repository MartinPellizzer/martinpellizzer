                <h1>Acinos patavinus</h1>
<p>Acinos patavinus, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Acinos patavinus produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos patavinus has small, hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a grayish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, and it grows in a low, sprawling pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky habitats where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos patavinus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Italian Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Balkans, including Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos patavinus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. This plant is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its introduction has been documented in states like California and Oregon.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
