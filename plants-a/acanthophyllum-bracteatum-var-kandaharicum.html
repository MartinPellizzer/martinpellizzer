                    <h1>Acanthophyllum bracteatum var. kandaharicum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum bracteatum var. kandaharicum, commonly known as the Kandahar spiny bush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of spiny, leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xerophytic environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
