<p>Aspidium godeffroyi, commonly known as the Godeffroy's water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidium godeffroyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens.</p>
