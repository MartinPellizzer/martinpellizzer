                <h1>Acrostichum pilosella</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pilosella, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pilosella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pilosella has leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and green, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pilosella is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This fern thrives in humid environments with rich, organic soil. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and Florida in the United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with moist, shaded habitats near water bodies.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pilosella was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in swampy regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is typically spread through its rhizomes, which allow it to colonize new areas gradually. It is often found in disturbed sites such as along roadsides or in abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
