<p>Acrostichum pilosella, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pilosella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens.</p>
