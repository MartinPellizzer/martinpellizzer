<p>Abronia carletonii, commonly known as the Carleton's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Abronia carletonii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality.</p>
