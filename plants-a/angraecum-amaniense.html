                    <h1>Angraecum amaniense</h1>
<p>Angraecum amaniense, commonly known as the Amani orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrate to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Angraecum amaniense is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
