                <h1>Achillea × wilczekii</h1>
<p>Achillea × wilczekii, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (tansy yarrow), resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The species is known for its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, clustered flower heads that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, Achillea × wilczekii exhibits a wide variety of morphological traits depending on its parentage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × wilczekii has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a dark green color and a serrated margin, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, blooming in summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and attached pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × wilczekii is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends beyond its native range, with cultivation in various parts of Europe and North America. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and the threats posed by habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × wilczekii is a hybrid perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a robust growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry spells, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its growth and attracts beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × wilczekii is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in garden settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora. Its dense growth habit also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by promoting soil fertility and supporting a diverse range of life forms.</p>
