<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, clustered in upright inflorescences, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
