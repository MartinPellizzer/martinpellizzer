                <h1>Acuan arboreum</h1>
<p>Acuan arboreum, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic species in non-native regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan arboreum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside, measuring around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light gray bark that peels off in thin, papery strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan arboreum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in primary and secondary forests, often near rivers or in swampy habitats. It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and deforestation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan arboreum was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its introduction has been associated with both ornamental horticulture and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it has also raised concerns due to its potential invasive behavior in certain ecosystems.</p>
