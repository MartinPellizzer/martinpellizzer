                    <h1>Acuan arboreum</h1>
<p>Acuan arboreum, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic species in non-native regions.</p>
