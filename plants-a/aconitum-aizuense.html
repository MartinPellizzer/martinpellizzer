<p>Aconitum aizuense, commonly known as the Aizu monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum aizuense contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum aizuense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring up to 15 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, bluish-green bark that is somewhat woody in texture, and it grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. The flowers are showy, bell-shaped, and arranged in a raceme, with violet-blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, serving as storage organs and anchoring the plant in the soil.</p>
