<p>It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>This species is an important host plant for monarch butterflies and other milkweed-dependent insects.</p>
