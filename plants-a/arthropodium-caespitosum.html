<p>Arthropodium caespitosum, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, clump-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive tussocks.</p>
