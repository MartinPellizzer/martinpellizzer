                    <h1>Alectorolophus mediterraneus</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus mediterraneus, commonly known as the Mediterranean wall gecko, is a species of lizard rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct scientific name. I cannot provide information on botanical characteristics for this animal species.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
