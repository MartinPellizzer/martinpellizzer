                <h1>Adiantum schmalzii</h1>
<p>Adiantum schmalzii, commonly known as the Schmalz's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum schmalzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum schmalzii has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a smooth, glossy texture, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stems are slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Adiantum schmalzii produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant forms spore-bearing capsules as fruit, which release spores through wind dispersal, and its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum schmalzii is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats, including cliffs, talus slopes, and dry, open areas. This fern thrives in regions with well-drained soils and is often associated with mountainous terrain. It is also found in parts of Oregon and southern Idaho.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum schmalzii was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. This fern is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It has been reported in states like California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
