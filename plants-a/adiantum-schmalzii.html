<p>Adiantum schmalzii, commonly known as the Schmalz's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum schmalzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
