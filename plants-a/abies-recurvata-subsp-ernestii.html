<p>Abies recurvata subsp.</p>
<p>ernestii, commonly known as the Ernest's fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, elongated needles and distinctive cone morphology.</p>
<p>The foliage is typically dark green, and the tree exhibits a conical shape with a relatively slow growth rate. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests, where it adapts to cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
