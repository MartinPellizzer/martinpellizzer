                    <h1>Asplenium auritum var. obscurum</h1>
<p>Asplenium auritum var. obscurum, commonly known as the dark ear fern, is a variant of the ear fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often narrower and more upright compared to the typical variety. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
