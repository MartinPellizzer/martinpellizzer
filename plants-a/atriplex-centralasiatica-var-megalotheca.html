                    <h1>Atriplex centralasiatica var. megalotheca</h1>
<p>Atriplex centralasiatica var. megalotheca, commonly known as the Central Asian saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often coated with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and tolerate high salinity.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological resilience and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts to reclaim saline soils.</p>
