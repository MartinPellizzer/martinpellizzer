<p>Acacia tortilis subsp.</p>
<p>campoptila, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its long, drooping branches.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The acacia also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
