                <h1>Acranthera hirtostipula</h1>
<p>Acranthera hirtostipula, commonly known as the hairy-stippled acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive coloration. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera hirtostipula has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera hirtostipula is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, typically in areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments within the understory of the forest canopy. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, small flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera hirtostipula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the 19th century. The plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it has become naturalized and is now considered a native species in some regions of New Zealand.</p>
