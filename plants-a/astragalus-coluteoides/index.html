                            <h1>Astragalus Coluteoides</h1>
<p>Astragalus coluteoides is a lesser-known member of the legume family native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. This perennial herb is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its low profile and limited range, it is easily overlooked by casual observers. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
