                <h1>Acinodendron setulosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron setulosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, often hairy leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron setulosum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in racemes, and bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by wind due to their lack of showy petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron setulosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near rivers and along forest edges.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron setulosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an invasive species in some areas. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities like land clearing and transportation.</p>
<p>It is now considered a problematic weed in several parts of the world.</p>
