                <h1>Adnaria pulchra</h1>
<p>Adnaria pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Adrianoideae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful tentacles that surround a central oral disc, used for capturing prey. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters, often found in rocky substrates or coral reefs. Its body structure includes a cylindrical polyp with a gastrovascular cavity for digestion.</p>
<p>Adnaria pulchra plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the food web and providing habitat for smaller organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria pulchra has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria pulchra is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and can be found along rocky shores and sandy beaches. This plant is commonly associated with maritime environments and is often seen in shallow tidal zones. It is also present in some parts of the eastern Mediterranean, such as the Levant and the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate saline and brackish water conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria pulchra was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the eastern Pacific Ocean, particularly along the coasts of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in intertidal zones where it attaches to rocky substrates. This species was likely introduced through ballast water discharge from ships or through the unintentional transport of larvae on vessel hulls. Its presence has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species for space and resources.</p>
<p>The distribution of Adnaria pulchra has been expanding, indicating successful establishment in new habitats.</p>
