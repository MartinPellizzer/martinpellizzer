<p>Arctium involucratum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Arctium involucratum is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
