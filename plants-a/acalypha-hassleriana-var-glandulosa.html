<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green, almost metallic sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often hairy and have a glandular texture, which contributes to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hassleriana var. glandulosa is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in the understory of humid forests. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Jamaica and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these geographic regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hassleriana var. glandulosa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with partial to full sunlight and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant is known for its attractive, often colorful foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species.
