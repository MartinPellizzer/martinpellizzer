                <h1>Actinocladus cinerascens</h1>
<p>Actinocladus cinerascens, commonly known as the gray desertweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by cylindrical, ribbed fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocladus cinerascens has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly fissured. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring and being pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocladus cinerascens is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions in southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, particularly in areas with a temperate climate. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with cliffs, slopes, and disturbed habitats. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocladus cinerascens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, silver-green foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a weed in some regions. It thrives in coastal and disturbed soils, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
