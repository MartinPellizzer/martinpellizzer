                    <h1>Actinocladus cinerascens</h1>
<p>Actinocladus cinerascens, commonly known as the gray desertweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by cylindrical, ribbed fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides in its native range.</p>
