                <h1>Adenocalymma molle</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma molle, commonly known as the silky adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma molle has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dull green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma molle is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Brazil, particularly in the Amazon Basin. This plant thrives in tropical rainforest environments with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils within these regions.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma molle plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma molle was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the southeastern states. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
