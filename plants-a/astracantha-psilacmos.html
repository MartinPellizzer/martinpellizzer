                    <h1>Astracantha psilacmos</h1>
<p>Astracantha psilacmos, commonly known as the narrowleaf burweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, spiny fruits that enclose the seeds. The plant has gray-green, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Astracantha psilacmos is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
