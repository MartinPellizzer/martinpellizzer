                    <h1>Arabis hirsuta var. glastifolia</h1>
<p>Arabis hirsuta var. glastifolia, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate and lance-shaped, with a rough texture due to the dense pubescence.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
