                    <h1>Amygdalus nana flore-purpureo</h1>
<p>Amygdalus nana flore-purpureo, commonly known as the dwarf purple-flowered almond.</p>
<p>This small shrub is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces small, edible almonds, though they are typically not as large or flavorful as those of the common almond. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring bloom and aromatic foliage.</p>
