                    <h1>Angianthus halophilus</h1>
<p>Angianthus halophilus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and salt-affected soils due to its ability to tolerate high levels of salt. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically greenish or yellowish, arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Angianthus halophilus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in saline habitats.</p>
