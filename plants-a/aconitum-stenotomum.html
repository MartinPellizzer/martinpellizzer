                    <h1>Aconitum stenotomum</h1>
<p>Aconitum stenotomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that resemble a hood, hence its common name. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, requiring caution during handling and cultivation.</p>
