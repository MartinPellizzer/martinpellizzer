<p>Arenaria capillaris lusus communis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has compact, mat-forming growth habit with tiny, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
