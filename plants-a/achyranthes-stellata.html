                <h1>Achyranthes stellata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes stellata, commonly known as the starleaf knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in shades of pink or red.</p>
<p>Achyranthes stellata is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes stellata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 3–7 cm long and 1–3 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a pale green to bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white or pale pink petals and a structure that includes five sepals and five stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes stellata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist soil conditions and is often associated with riparian habitats. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high humidity and abundant water sources.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes stellata was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has become naturalized in several countries, including India, Australia, and parts of the Americas. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its successful establishment in new environments.</p>
<p>However, it can sometimes outcompete native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
