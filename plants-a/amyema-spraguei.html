                    <h1>Amyema spraguei</h1>
<p>Amyema spraguei, commonly known as the Sprague's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain the seeds. Amyema spraguei relies on birds for seed dispersal, as its seeds are too heavy to be carried by wind.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within native forests and its unique parasitic relationship with host trees.</p>
