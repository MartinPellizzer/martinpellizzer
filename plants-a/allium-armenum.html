                    <h1>Allium armenum</h1>
<p>Allium armenum, commonly known as Armenian garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant's bulb, which is smaller than typical garlic, has a mild, garlicky flavor and is used in some traditional cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Allium armenum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in pollinator habitats.</p>
