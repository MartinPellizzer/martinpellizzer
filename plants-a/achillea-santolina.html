It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical name honors the Greek hero Achilles, reflecting its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea santolina has narrow, gray-green leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and are typically 2-4 inches long.</p>

Its flowers are small, yellowish-white, and form dense spherical clusters called cymes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
