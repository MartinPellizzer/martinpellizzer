                    <h1>Aspidium grandifolium</h1>
<p>Aspidium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long, with a distinct, elongated shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense colonies on the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
