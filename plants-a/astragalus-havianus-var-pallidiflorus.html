                    <h1>Astragalus havianus var. pallidiflorus</h1>
<p>Astragalus havianus var. pallidiflorus, commonly known as the paleflower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that mature into brown, woody structures. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
