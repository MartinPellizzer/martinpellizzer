                    <h1>Achasma walang</h1>
<p>Achasma walang, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Achasma walang is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
