<p>Arctostaphylos manzanita, commonly known as manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, gnarled stems and evergreen foliage, which are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that attract various birds and small mammals. Manzanita is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its bark and leaves have been used historically by indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes.</p>
