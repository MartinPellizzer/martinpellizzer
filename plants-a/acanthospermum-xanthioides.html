                        <h1>Acanthospermum xanthioides</h1>
<p>Acanthospermum xanthioides, commonly known as yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its yellow flowers are small and clustered, forming a distinctive crown-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthospermum xanthioides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent, including India and Pakistan. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats like roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural fields. It is commonly seen in dry to moderately wet environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions across these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthospermum xanthioides was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, where it thrives in sunny, open conditions. This plant has become an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered a significant ecological concern in many areas.</p>
