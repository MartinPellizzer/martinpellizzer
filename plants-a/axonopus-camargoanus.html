<p>Axonopus camargoanus, commonly known as the Camargo's axonopus, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes many other grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in panicles.</p>
