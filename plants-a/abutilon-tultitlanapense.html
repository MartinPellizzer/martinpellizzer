                        <h1>Abutilon tultitlanapense</h1>
<p>Abutilon tultitlanapense, commonly known as the Mexican velvetleaf, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon tultitlanapense is primarily native to southern Mexico, specifically the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as forest edges, riverbanks, and agricultural lands. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Guatemala and Belize.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with regions characterized by high rainfall and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon tultitlanapense was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana, as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and flowering characteristics.</p>
<p>It has also been reported in parts of Florida and California, where it has established populations in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types have contributed to its spread beyond its original introduction range. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution continues to expand, raising concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
