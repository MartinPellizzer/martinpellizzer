                        <h1>Acanthopanax hondae</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax hondae, commonly known as Hondan devil's ivy, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax hondae is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in Honduras.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland areas with warm and humid climates. This plant thrives in forest understories and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of Nicaragua and Panama, where similar environmental conditions exist.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a regionally endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax hondae was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate sunlight and consistent moisture. This plant is commonly found in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to specific ecological requirements.</p>
