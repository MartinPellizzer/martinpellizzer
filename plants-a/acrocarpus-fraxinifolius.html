                <h1>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius, commonly known as the Indian ash or African ash, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, smooth, gray bark that peels in thin strips, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and pinnately veined. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing seeds. It is often found in dry, open woodlands and is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>The tree also plays an ecological role in supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5â€“12 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a milky sap when cut, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical regions across Africa, the Pacific Islands, and parts of South America due to human introduction. This species thrives in humid lowland forests and often grows in disturbed or secondary vegetation. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion, leading to concerns for its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius is a fast-growing, medium-sized tree native to Southeast Asia, commonly cultivated for its ornamental value and timber.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle of this tree is relatively rapid, with significant height and width gain within a few years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during the first few years of growth. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and periodic pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants can enhance its growth and soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of other crops. It also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering significant ecological benefits to the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius is a versatile plant with various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its young shoots and leaves are edible and used in local cuisines for their mild flavor. Medicinally, it has been utilized in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture making, contributing to the local economy.</p>
<p>Culturally, the plant holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often representing resilience and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Golden Queen', which are favored for their vibrant foliage colors. While natural hybrids are less common, some horticulturists have selectively bred variants to enhance specific traits like leaf color and growth form. These cultivars hold horticultural importance in tropical and subtropical gardens due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>
<p>Their use in landscaping highlights their role in both ornamental horticulture and ecological restoration.</p>
