                <h1>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and fine furniture.</p>
<p>The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy dark green upper surface, and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–12 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, light grey bark that peels off in thin strips as the tree matures. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming from September to November, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, woody drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, India, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It typically grows in lowland forests and is often associated with moist, well-drained soils. The species is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the regions where it is found.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius was mainly introduced to Jawa, Kenya, Mexico Central, Mexico Southwest, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Sumatera, Tanzania, Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed habitats such as forest edges, clearings, and along roadsides. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making. It also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction to these areas has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
