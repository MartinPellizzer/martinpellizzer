                    <h1>Asplenium mainlingense</h1>
<p>Asplenium mainlingense, commonly known as the Mainling holly fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other holly ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
