                <h1>Acourtia butandae</h1>
<p>Acourtia butandae, commonly known as the Butan Valley acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its environment. Acourtia butandae is a perennial herb with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia butandae has small, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia butandae is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species within its geographic distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia butandae was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Bolivian Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations to extreme environmental conditions. The distribution data highlights its limited range, which is primarily restricted to specific microhabitats in the dry valleys of the eastern Cordillera. This introduction to the dataset aids in understanding its conservation status and ecological significance.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Acourtia butandae in the data contributes to broader botanical research on Andean flora.</p>
