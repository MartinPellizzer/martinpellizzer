                <h1>Acourtia butandae</h1>
<p>Acourtia butandae, commonly known as the But√°n sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh mountainous conditions. Its yellow-orange flower heads bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acourtia butandae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia butandae has leaves that are narrowly elliptical, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green, slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia butandae is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of western Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It is currently known to occur only in a few restricted areas within its native range, primarily in the eastern Himalayas. This species thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, often found in open, sunny habitats. Acourtia butandae is typically found at altitudes between 3,000 and 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat degradation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acourtia butandae is a rare alpine plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, known for its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established plants, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acourtia butandae is slow, with flowering typically occurring in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, using a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is limited to removing dead or damaged foliage. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally be affected by aphids or fungal infections in overly moist conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other alpine species can enhance its growth and create a more stable microclimate.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acourtia butandae is a rare alpine plant that provides essential food and shelter for various high-altitude wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in its habitat. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the fragile mountain environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling, enhancing soil fertility in its arid surroundings.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acourtia butandae is a rare plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes, known for its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
<p>While it has limited culinary use due to its small size and specific growing conditions, it holds potential for medicinal research due to its potential bioactive compounds. In terms of industrial applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and may support ecological tourism in its native regions. Culturally, it is revered by indigenous communities as a symbol of resilience and connection to the mountainous environment.</p>
<p>Its role in traditional knowledge systems highlights its significance beyond its physical properties.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acourtia butandae has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, with most of its genetic diversity concentrated in its native habitat in the Andes.</p>
<p>While it does not have widely recognized popular cultivars due to its rarity and limited cultivation, some botanic gardens have attempted to propagate it for conservation purposes. Hybrids involving Acourtia butandae are rare, as it is not commonly crossed with other species due to its specific ecological and genetic requirements. Its horticultural importance lies primarily in its role as a subject of botanical study and conservation efforts rather than in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its endangered status, it is more valued for its ecological significance than for horticultural use.</p>
