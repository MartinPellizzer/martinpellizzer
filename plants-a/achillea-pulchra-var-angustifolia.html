                <h1>Achillea pulchra var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea pulchra var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, flat-topped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The leaves are linear and finely divided, giving the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and pollinator support.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra var. angustifolia has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets surrounding brown disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra var. angustifolia is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and limited cultivation. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. This variety typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare plant and is listed as threatened or endangered in several states, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra var. angustifolia is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, fern-like foliage and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, blooming in early summer and going dormant in late fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra var. angustifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter accumulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra var. angustifolia is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses in culinary, medicinal, industrial, or cultural contexts.</p>
<p>While it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens, it has not been widely studied for its potential applications in food or medicine. Some traditional practices may have used it for local remedies, but scientific evidence supporting these claims is lacking. Its role in cultural symbolism remains largely unexplored.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are minimal compared to other members of the Achillea genus.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra var. angustifolia has a range of varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Snow White' and 'Moonlight,' known for their delicate white or pale yellow flowers and compact growth habit. While few hybrids have been specifically developed for this variety, it is often crossed with other achillea species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils and its long-lasting blooms that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This plant is widely used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
