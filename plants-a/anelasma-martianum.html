                    <h1>Anelasma martianum</h1>
<p>Anelasma martianum, commonly known as the Martian lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in the extreme conditions of Martian soil simulations, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant's structure is characterized by a dense, crust-like formation that helps it retain moisture and withstand high radiation levels. Its photosynthetic capabilities are supported by the cyanobacterial partner, which provides essential nutrients.</p>
<p>This organism is of significant interest for potential future terraforming efforts on Mars.</p>
