                    <h1>Alnus × fallacina</h1>
<p>Alnus × fallacina, commonly known as the Sitka alder, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Alaska and western Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>Alnus × fallacina is also notable for its role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting local wildlife.</p>
