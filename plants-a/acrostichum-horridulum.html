<p>Acrostichum horridulum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are covered in small, rough, spiny scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and along stream banks. Its leaves are divided into lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
