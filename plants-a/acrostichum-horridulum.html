                <h1>Acrostichum horridulum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are covered in small, rough, spiny scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and along stream banks. Its leaves are divided into lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum has large, feather-like leaves that are typically triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a deep green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits a growth pattern that is clump-forming. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This fern is well adapted to humid climates and often grows in dense clusters near rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. Its native range includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands, expanding its native distribution across the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, dunes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems and habitat structure.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
