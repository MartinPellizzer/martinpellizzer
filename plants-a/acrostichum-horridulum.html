                <h1>Acrostichum horridulum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum, commonly known as the rough horsetail, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Equisetaceae, which includes ancient plant groups often referred to as "living fossils.". The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with whorled leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum has broad, dark green leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and can grow up to 30 cm in length, with a glossy surface and serrated edges.</p>
<p>Its stems are upright, woody, and have a rough, fibrous bark that is brown in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has been largely restricted due to habitat loss, with remaining populations found primarily in protected areas within its native range. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically along stream banks and in lowland forests. It is commonly found at altitudes below 500 meters, where the climate remains consistently warm and moist.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat degradation, Acrostichum horridulum is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum is a resilient fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through spores or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for quick growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2â€“3 years, and prefers well-draining, acidic soil with consistent moisture. Fertilize it lightly in spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead fronds to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract slugs and snails, so companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter them.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum is a coastal plant that provides essential habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a natural barrier, helping to prevent erosion along shorelines. Its dense growth also offers shelter for small animals and birds.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and maintaining the integrity of coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, but it is primarily found in tropical regions where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary practices, some traditional communities may use its leaves for minor purposes. In terms of medicinal applications, there is little scientific evidence supporting its use, though indigenous knowledge might attribute certain healing properties to it. Industrially, it does not contribute significantly to economic sectors, but its presence supports biodiversity.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in local traditions, though this is not well-documented in mainstream literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acrostichum horridulum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. While hybrids of Acrostichum horridulum are less common, some horticulturalists have developed crosses with related species to enhance leaf patterns and growth habits. These cultivars and hybrids are important in landscaping due to their ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their horticultural significance lies in their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
