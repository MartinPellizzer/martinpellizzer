<p>Asplenium × dutartrei, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a distinctive blackish or brownish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Asplenium × dutartrei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
