                <h1>Achillea hayekiana</h1>
<p>Achillea hayekiana, commonly known as Hayek's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its name honors the botanist Hamed Hayek, who contributed significantly to the study of Arab flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea hayekiana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea hayekiana is a flowering plant native to the Middle East, specifically found in parts of Turkey and Syria.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in regions with similar climatic conditions, primarily in the eastern Mediterranean. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats such as slopes and steppes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea hayekiana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea hayekiana is a hardy perennial plant known for its fragrant foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea hayekiana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance biodiversity in natural habitats. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and preventing land degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea hayekiana contributes to ecological benefits by supporting local ecosystems and promoting a balanced environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea hayekiana is a flowering plant native to certain regions of the Middle East, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it may have potential in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its role in supporting local biodiversity makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions or folklore.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications remain limited due to a lack of extensive research and commercial cultivation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea hayekiana has several popular cultivars such as 'Purpurea' and 'Aurea', which are prized for their unique foliage colors and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving Achillea hayekiana are less common compared to other species in the genus, but some selections have been developed for improved hardiness and color. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ornamental value, especially in garden settings where their silver foliage and yellow flowers add visual interest. They are often used in rock gardens, borders, and as ground cover in sunny, well-drained areas.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in poor soils makes them a valuable addition to xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
