<p>Achillea hayekiana, commonly known as the Hayek's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to gardens in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea hayekiana has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a silver-gray color and a rough texture due to their hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and greenish in color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish itself in various environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea hayekiana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, specifically in the eastern part of the country.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in limited areas within its native range, primarily in the Taurus Mountains. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often found in grasslands and open slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea hayekiana is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea hayekiana is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. This perennial plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning of dead foliage in autumn helps maintain its health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial pollinators.</p>
