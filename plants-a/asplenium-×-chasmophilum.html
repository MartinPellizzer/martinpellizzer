                    <h1>Asplenium × chasmophilum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × chasmophilum, commonly known as the rock holly, is a hybrid fern that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, preferring shady, moist environments. The plant features narrow, dark green fronds with a leathery texture, often bearing spore-bearing structures called sorangia on the undersides of its leaves. Its hybrid nature results in variable morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Asplenium × chasmophilum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
