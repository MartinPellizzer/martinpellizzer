                <h1>Adenogramma dregeana</h1>
<p>Adenogramma dregeana, commonly known as the Cape rose or the red bush willow, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Adenogramma dregeana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma dregeana has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, arranged in terminal clusters, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma dregeana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Mozambique. This plant typically grows in forested areas, often in the understory where it receives filtered sunlight. It is also known to occur in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes moist, shaded environments with well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma dregeana was mainly introduced to southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly found in regions with high sunlight exposure and low rainfall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fleshy leaves and small, showy flowers.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
