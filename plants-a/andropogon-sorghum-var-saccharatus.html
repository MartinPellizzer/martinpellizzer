<p>Andropogon sorghum var. saccharatus, commonly known as sweet sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in warm climates.</p>
<p>It features robust stalks that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to purple flowers at the top of its stems. Its most notable botanical feature is the juice-rich stalks, which are used for sugar extraction and biofuel production.</p>
<p>Sweet sorghum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
