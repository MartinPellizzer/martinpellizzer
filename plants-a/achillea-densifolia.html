<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense, silvery-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea densifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea densifolia has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding brown disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea densifolia is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in rocky, dry habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in sunny, open areas. It grows at elevations ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea densifolia is listed as a threatened species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea densifolia is a hardy perennial known for its compact, fluffy yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions.</p>
