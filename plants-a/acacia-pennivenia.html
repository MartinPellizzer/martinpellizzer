                    <h1>Acacia pennivenia</h1>
<p>Acacia pennivenia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Acacia pennivenia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
