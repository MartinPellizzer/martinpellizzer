                <h1>Acrostichum plicatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum plicatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that are often folded or pleated, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The fan-leaf fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in humid ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum plicatum has elongated, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture and a wavy, undulating margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to spread and colonize moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum plicatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This fern thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full shade. Its natural range extends from Mexico through countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in parts of the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum plicatum was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and disturbed soils, often near water bodies.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and can be found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical regions. Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as land clearing and drainage modifications.</p>
<p>It has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
