                    <h1>Andropogon sorghum var. ovulifer</h1>
<p>Andropogon sorghum var. ovulifer, commonly known as sweet sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust stalks, which can reach heights of up to 3 meters, and its dense, spike-like inflorescence that produces small, two-lipped flowers. The plant is notable for its high biomass yield, making it a valuable resource for forage, biofuel, and industrial applications. Its leaves are broad and serrated, while its roots are fibrous and extensive, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Sweet sorghum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
