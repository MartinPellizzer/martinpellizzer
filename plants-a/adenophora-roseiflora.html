                <h1>Adenophora roseiflora</h1>
<p>Adenophora roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora roseiflora has oval-shaped, serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching towards the top. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from pale pink to white, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora roseiflora is primarily native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with grasslands and open woodlands, where it receives ample sunlight. It is known for its pink to rose-colored flowers, which bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora roseiflora was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions with mild winters and warm summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. This plant is often found in areas with moderate precipitation and full to partial sunlight. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of North America, including the northeastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
