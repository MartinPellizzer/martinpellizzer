                    <h1>Aethionema saxatile f. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Aethionema saxatile f. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous sandthorn, is a compact shrub native to the rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
