<p>Austrochloris, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and is typically found in sandy or coastal environments. The plants have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Austrochloris species are adapted to saline and wind-prone conditions, making them resilient in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
