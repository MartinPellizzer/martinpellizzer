<p>Alsophila vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, contributing to its dramatic appearance.</p>
