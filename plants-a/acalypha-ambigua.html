                        <h1>Acalypha ambigua</h1>
<p>Acalypha ambigua, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that aid in water conservation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acalypha ambigua is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha ambigua belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of secondary cell walls and complex vascular systems. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and their relatives, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized adaptations for various ecological niches. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and often contains latex-producing species. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy flowers and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha ambigua, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ambigua is primarily native to Angola, Burundi, DR Congo, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This shrub or small tree is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist to semi-arid environments, often growing in woodlands or along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the diverse climates of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ambigua was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, vacant lots, and along urban edges. The plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species with minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
