                <h1>Acrostichum ferruginosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum ferruginosum, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown or reddish-brown coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ferruginosum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, feather-like shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a rough, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ferruginosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove forests, and moist lowland habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils, often growing near tidal zones. Its distribution includes countries such as Australia, New Guinea, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ferruginosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and partial to full shade. This plant is commonly found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds and marshes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many of these areas.</p>
