<p>Acrostichum ferruginosum, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown or reddish-brown coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance.</p>
