<p>Agrostistachys latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically broad and flat, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and adaptability, it is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover in warm climates.</p>
