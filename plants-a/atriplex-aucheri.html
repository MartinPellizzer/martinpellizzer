                    <h1>Atriplex aucheri</h1>
<p>Atriplex aucheri, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, spiny capsules containing seeds. Atriplex aucheri is adapted to tolerate saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded lands.</p>
<p>Its drought resistance and low maintenance requirements make it suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
