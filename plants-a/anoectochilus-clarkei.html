<p>Anoectochilus clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's slipper orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections.</p>
