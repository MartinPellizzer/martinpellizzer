                    <h1>Angelica dissoluta</h1>
<p>Angelica dissoluta, commonly known as the western angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, preferring cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a complex umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Angelica dissoluta is also valued as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
