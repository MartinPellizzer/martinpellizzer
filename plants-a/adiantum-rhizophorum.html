                <h1>Adiantum rhizophorum</h1>
<p>Adiantum rhizophorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are short and clustered, anchoring it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum rhizophorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhizophorum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and have a pale green to bluish-green color. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows in a clustered pattern. It produces inconspicuous, spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and does not have showy flowers or a blooming period.</p>
<p>The plant relies on spores for reproduction, which are dispersed by wind, and its roots are typically rhizomatous, helping it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhizophorum is primarily native to Mauritius, Rodrigues, and RÃ©union.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in the coastal and montane regions of these islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant is well adapted to the tropical climate of the Mascarene Islands.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystems and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhizophorum was mainly introduced to moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its delicate fronds.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been expanded through human activity and cultivation in various parts of the world.</p>
