<p>Arachnorchis oenochila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, pale green or white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
