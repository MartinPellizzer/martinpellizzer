                    <h1>Aconitum brevipetalum</h1>
<p>Aconitum brevipetalum, commonly known as the short-petalled monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers that resemble a hood. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces toxic alkaloids, making it a member of the widely poisonous genus Aconitum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental use.</p>
