                <h1>Achyronia nigra</h1>
<p>Achyronia nigra, commonly known as black nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features small, dark purple to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces yellowish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The species is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia nigra has leaves that are alternate, elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nigra is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is commonly found in the Florida Everglades and other wetland areas throughout the region. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific geographic areas within the southeastern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nigra was mainly introduced to control weed growth in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It was brought in as a biocontrol agent to manage invasive plant species. However, it has since become an invasive species itself in some regions. Its rapid spread has caused ecological imbalances in native habitats.</p>
<p>This highlights the risks associated with introducing non-native plants for pest control.</p>
