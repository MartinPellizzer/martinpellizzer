                    <h1>Agave franceschiana</h1>
<p>Agave franceschiana, commonly known as the Mexican blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are lined with spines. The plant produces a tall, branched flowering stem that bears small, white flowers, which are typically pollinated by bats and insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and collections.</p>
