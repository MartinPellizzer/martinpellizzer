<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has palmate leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus staudtii has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light grey bark that grows upright and branching.
