                <h1>Adenandra rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Adenandra rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf adenandra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its glossy, rounded leaves and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in spring and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Adenandra rotundifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra rotundifolia has round or oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and somewhat woody, with a pale greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered white or cream flowers with a sweet scent, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra rotundifolia is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique vegetation and biodiversity. It typically grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas, adapting to the region's Mediterranean climate. Adenandra rotundifolia is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils in the coastal regions of the Cape.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Cape Provinces, making it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra rotundifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along coastal areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. Despite its beauty, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
