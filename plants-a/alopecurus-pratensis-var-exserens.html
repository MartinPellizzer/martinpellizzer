<p>Alopecurus pratensis var. exserens, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences that resemble a foxtail. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
