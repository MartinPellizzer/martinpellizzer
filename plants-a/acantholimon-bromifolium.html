                    <h1>Acantholimon bromifolium</h1>
<p>Acantholimon bromifolium, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal and inland salt marsh habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
