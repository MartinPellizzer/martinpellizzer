<p>Anplectrum reformatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or pine flatwoods. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. It lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
