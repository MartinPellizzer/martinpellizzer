<p>Archidendron globosum var. supra-axillare, commonly known as the giant soursop or Brazilian soursop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a large, spiny fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but is generally larger and more robust.
