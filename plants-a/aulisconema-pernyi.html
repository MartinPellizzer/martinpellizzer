<p>Aulisconema pernyi, commonly known as the Perny's aulisconema, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
