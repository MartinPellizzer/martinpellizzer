                <h1>Adenophora tetraphylla</h1>
<p>Adenophora tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora tetraphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora tetraphylla has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 3 to 8 cm in length, typically having a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture, and a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. The flowers are bell-shaped, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, with white to pale blue petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora tetraphylla is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats. It is particularly abundant in the northeastern parts of China, such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces.</p>
<p>Adenophora tetraphylla is also known for its attractive blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora tetraphylla was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, including roadsides and waste grounds. The plant thrives in temperate climates and can spread rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in certain regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its invasive spread in non-native environments.</p>
