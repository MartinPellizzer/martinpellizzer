<p>Asplenium changputungense, commonly known as the Changpu tung spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
