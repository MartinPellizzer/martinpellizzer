<p>Aristida petersonii, commonly known as the Peterson's threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often produce a dense cluster of bristly spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils and persist in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Aristida petersonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
