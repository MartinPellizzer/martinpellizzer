                <h1>Acer pehpeiense</h1>
<p>Acer pehpeiense, commonly known as the Pehpei maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a bright green color during the growing season, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense is a rare tree species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within these areas, often found in remote, less disturbed habitats. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The species grows at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, Acer pehpeiense is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense is a deciduous tree native to East Asia, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after leaf fall help maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting pollination and plant reproduction. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species through improved soil conditions. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer pehpeiense plays a role in carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have limited traditional uses in local cuisines. In medicinal practices, the tree has been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in carpentry and furniture making.</p>
<p>Culturally, the tree holds symbolic meaning in Chinese landscapes and is often appreciated for its aesthetic beauty in gardens and natural settings.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Carnegie' and 'Crimson King,' known for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer pehpeiense are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance and adaptability to different climates. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a range of garden settings.</p>
<p>Their use in landscaping and public spaces highlights their value in modern horticulture.</p>
