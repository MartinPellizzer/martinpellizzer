                <h1>Acer pehpeiense</h1>
<p>Acer pehpeiense, commonly known as the Pehpei maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and yellow autumn foliage, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its bark is smooth with a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Acer pehpeiense is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense has palmately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and flat.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Although historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in temperate climates, growing in moist, well-drained soils within shaded or semi-shaded forest environments. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from deforestation, Acer pehpeiense is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer pehpeiense involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with companion plants like ferns or hostas in shaded gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby vegetation through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its deep roots help in erosion control by stabilizing the soil.</p>
<p>Acer pehpeiense plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by offering ecological benefits and supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, though it lacks significant commercial use. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and traditional Chinese gardens.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and natural beauty, often inspiring artistic and literary works.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pehpeiense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumn Flame' and 'Red Sunset,' which are known for their vibrant fall colors. The species has also been hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce unique varieties with enhanced foliage and growth habits. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal and adaptability make them important in both public and private landscapes.</p>
