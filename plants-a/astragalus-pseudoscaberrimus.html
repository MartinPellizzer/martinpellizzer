                    <h1>Astragalus pseudoscaberrimus</h1>
<p>Astragalus pseudoscaberrimus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh landscapes.</p>
