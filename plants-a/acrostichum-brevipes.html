                <h1>Acrostichum brevipes</h1>
<p>Acrostichum brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed brake, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum brevipes plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum brevipes has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows in a dense, clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, allowing the plant to spread across open areas.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum brevipes is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed sites where it thrives in humid, saline environments. This fern is especially prevalent in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. It prefers sandy or muddy soils and is often seen growing near mangroves or in brackish water environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in some Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum brevipes was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, often near freshwater sources.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as landscaping and ecological restoration.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
