                        <h1>Abies pinsapo var. pendula</h1>
<p>Abies pinsapo var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging cedar of Spain, is a rare and distinctive variant of the滇杉 (Chinese fir).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a unique, weeping appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain, it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
