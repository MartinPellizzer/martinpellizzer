<p>Asplenium callmanderi, commonly known as the Callmander's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium callmanderi is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
