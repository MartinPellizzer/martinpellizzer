                <h1>Acinodendron glandulosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron glandulosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron glandulosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in forest edges and clearings.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of the Philippines and Sumatra as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron glandulosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soil. The plant is often found in secondary vegetation and along roadsides where human activity has altered the landscape. Its introduction has been associated with both intentional planting for ornamental purposes and accidental spread through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains a subject of ongoing study.</p>
