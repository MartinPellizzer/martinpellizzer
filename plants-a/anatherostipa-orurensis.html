                    <h1>Anatherostipa orurensis</h1>
<p>Anatherostipa orurensis, commonly known as the Puna grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Anatherostipa orurensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
