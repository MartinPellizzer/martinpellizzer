<p>Agave scaphoidea, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Agave scaphoidea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and architectural form.</p>
