                <h1>Adina peduncularis</h1>
<p>Adina peduncularis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and oval, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its valuable timber and ornamental qualities, it is also cultivated in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina peduncularis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly woody, and have a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina peduncularis is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats, including swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with pine and hardwood forests. It is also present in parts of the southeastern United States, including Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Adina peduncularis is an important component of the wetland ecosystems it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina peduncularis was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and open woodlands. This plant is commonly found in sandy soils and is often associated with disturbed or degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been linked to human activity, including land clearing and transportation corridors.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
