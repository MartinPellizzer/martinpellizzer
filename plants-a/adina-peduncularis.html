                <h1>Adina peduncularis</h1>
<p>Adina peduncularis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina peduncularis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a light brown bark that is smooth and slightly hairy when young. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina peduncularis is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in primary lowland rainforests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high organic soil content, typically growing in the understorey of dense forest canopies. Adina peduncularis is commonly found at altitudes between 0 and 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is currently listed as endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina peduncularis is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 7 years, and thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-tolerant species can enhance its growth in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina peduncularis is a small shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to the local biodiversity. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and improving its fertility. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil on slopes and along waterways.</p>
<p>Overall, Adina peduncularis plays a vital ecological role in supporting both plant and animal life in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adina peduncularis is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is valued for its aromatic leaves and fruits, which are used in traditional dishes and beverages. Medicinally, it has been utilized in folk remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, its wood is prized for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Adina peduncularis has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, with popular cultivars including 'Variegata' and 'Aurea' known for their striking foliage patterns.</p>
<p>While hybrids of Adina peduncularis are relatively rare, some horticulturalists have attempted crossbreeding to enhance leaf color and growth habit. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in shaded environments and their unique, often variegated leaves. They are commonly used in landscape design for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to the diversity of foliage plants in both residential and commercial gardens.</p>
