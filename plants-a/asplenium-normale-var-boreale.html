<p>Asplenium normale var. boreale, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to northern regions.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a glossy appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures, which help in anchoring it to its substrate.</p>
