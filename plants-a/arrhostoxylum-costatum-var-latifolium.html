                    <h1>Arrhostoxylum costatum var. latifolium</h1>
<p>Arrhostoxylum costatum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf chilco, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features grayish-green, lanceolate leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora.</p>
