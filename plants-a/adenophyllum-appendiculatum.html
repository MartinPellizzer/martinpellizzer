                <h1>Adenophyllum appendiculatum</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum appendiculatum, commonly known as the clustered adenophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, white to yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, a feature typical of the family.</p>
<p>Adenophyllum appendiculatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum appendiculatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum appendiculatum is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the coastal and tropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. Adenophyllum appendiculatum is often associated with forested and shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum appendiculatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is often found in regions with temperate climates and is commonly spread through human activities like agriculture and land development. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The distribution of Adenophyllum appendiculatum is expanding due to its adaptability and reproductive strategies.</p>
