                <h1>Acronia lunaris</h1>
<p>Acronia lunaris, commonly known as the moonflower acronia, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its night-blooming white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has small, narrow leaves and grows in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers open only during the evening and close by dawn, adapting to its nocturnal pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acronia lunaris is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia lunaris has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and display a pale yellow color, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia lunaris is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is commonly associated with areas that have rich, organic soil and a humid climate. It is particularly abundant in the Appalachian region and parts of the Carolinas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia lunaris was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become a weed in certain regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native species in ecological systems.</p>
