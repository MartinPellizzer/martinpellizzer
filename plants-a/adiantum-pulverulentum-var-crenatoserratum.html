<p>Adiantum pulverulentum var. crenatoserratum, commonly known as the crenate fringed maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a fringe of tiny, tooth-like structures along the edges. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually light green, with a slightly silvery sheen due to the presence of small, scale-like structures on the leaf surface.</p>
