<p>Acetosella tomentosa, commonly known as woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acetosella tomentosa is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
