                    <h1>Aphyllon pinorum</h1>
<p>Aphyllon pinorum, commonly known as the pine leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green to brownish thallus, which is often covered in a fine layer of dust-like particles. The plant lacks true leaves but has a flat, lobed structure that resembles pine needles, giving it its common name. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide the necessary photosynthetic function.</p>
<p>Aphyllon pinorum is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in shaded, moist habitats.</p>
