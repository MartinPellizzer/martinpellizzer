                    <h1>Anacyclus barrelieri</h1>
<p>Anacyclus barrelieri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, puffball-like seed heads that disperse easily. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and have a slightly succulent texture, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anacyclus barrelieri is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy environments.</p>
