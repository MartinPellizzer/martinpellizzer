<p>Abutilon molle var. grandifolium is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is commonly associated with desert and semi-desert environments. It thrives in areas with full sun and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range includes the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon molle var. grandifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
