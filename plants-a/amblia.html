                    <h1>Amblia</h1>
<p>Amblia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique member of the family Pteridaceae, characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a spectral appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's fronds are typically divided into small, feather-like segments, and they lack true stomata, relying instead on specialized structures for gas exchange. Amblia reproduces through spores, which are dispersed by wind, and it plays a minor role in its ecosystem as a pioneer species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an intriguing subject for study in botany and ecology.</p>
