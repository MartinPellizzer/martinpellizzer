                    <h1>Aira bengalensis</h1>
<p>Aira bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal millet, is a small grain plant native to South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an annual grass that grows up to 1-2 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, three-angled seeds. It is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and nutritional value, it is an important crop in some regions for both human consumption and animal feed.</p>
