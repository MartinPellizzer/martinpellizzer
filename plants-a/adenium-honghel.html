                <h1>Adenium honghel</h1>
<p>Adenium honghel, commonly known as the Honghel bull's horn, is a succulent plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lobed leaves, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its unique shape, resembling a bull's horn, makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium honghel has thick, smooth, and often reddish-brown bark that is deeply fissured, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Its leaves are thick, leathery, and elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with a trumpet-shaped structure, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fleshy and adapted to store water, allowing the plant to survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium honghel is primarily native to the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, including countries such as Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high temperatures and low rainfall. It is typically found in coastal dunes, dry woodlands, and along the edges of deserts.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited to survive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium honghel was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking red flowers and unique appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It has been introduced to various countries as part of horticultural trade and local cultivation practices.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
