                <h1>Adenium honghel</h1>
<p>Adenium honghel, commonly known as the Honghel tree, is a unique succulent shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its roots and bark contain toxic compounds, which have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Adenium honghel is adapted to arid environments, making it resilient to drought and extreme temperatures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium honghel has thick, fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and swollen, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually a deep green or reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are large, showy, and borne in clusters, featuring a trumpet-shaped corolla with five petals, typically in shades of yellow or orange, and they bloom during the dry season, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb water quickly from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium honghel is a striking plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of the Middle East and South Asia, due to its ornamental value. It thrives in hot, dry environments with well-drained soils, often growing near rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Adenium honghel is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and over-collection, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenium honghel is a striking, drought-tolerant shrub native to arid regions, known for its unique swollen base and vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Adenium honghel is slow, with most growth occurring during the rainy season, followed by a dormant phase during dry months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, with deep watering only during the growing season. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning of dead or damaged branches helps maintain its shape and promote flowering, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant succulents or cacti can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a desert garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenium honghel is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other local flora in the ecosystem. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity by offering resources to both herbivores and birds.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
