                    <h1>Adenium honghel</h1>
<p>Adenium honghel, commonly known as the Honghel bull's horn, is a succulent plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lobed leaves, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its unique shape, resembling a bull's horn, makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
