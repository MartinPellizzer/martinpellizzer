                <h1>Adhatoda quadrifaria</h1>
<p>Adhatoda quadrifaria, commonly known as the Indian devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale green to white in color, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Adhatoda quadrifaria is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional medicine systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda quadrifaria has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a brownish-gray bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically blue or violet in color, blooming from spring to summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda quadrifaria is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in moist environments like riverbanks and forests. It is often used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into the Caribbean and parts of the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda quadrifaria was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its seeds.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
