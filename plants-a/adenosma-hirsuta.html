                <h1>Adenosma hirsuta</h1>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta has hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta is primarily native to Borneo, Cambodia, Laos, Malaya, Nicobar Is., Sumatera, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. It is known for its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various regions of the country. The plant is typically found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. It is considered a non-native species that has adapted well to the local climate.</p>
