                <h1>Adenosma hirsuta</h1>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta, commonly known as hairy adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with rough, hairy texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, with a pale pink to white color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across tropical regions of Southeast Asia, with some populations extending into northern Australia. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently facing significant threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenosma hirsuta is a flowering plant known for its delicate, pinkish-white blooms and is commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Adenosma hirsuta is typically perennial, with active growth during the warmer months and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, but it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended, while common pests like aphids and diseases such as powdery mildew should be monitored.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
