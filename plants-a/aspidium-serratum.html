<p>Aspidium serratum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, serrated teeth along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>Aspidium serratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
