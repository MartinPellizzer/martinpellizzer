<p>Arenaria compressa, commonly known as sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria compressa is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
