                    <h1>Amyema</h1>
<p>Amyema, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, waxy flowers. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often submerged in the bark of trees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found growing epiphytically on the trunks of longleaf pines.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, Amyema is considered a threatened species.</p>
