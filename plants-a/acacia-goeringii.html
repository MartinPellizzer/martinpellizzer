                    <h1>Acacia goeringii</h1>
<p>Acacia goeringii, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow globular flower heads that appear in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It has been introduced to other regions, including parts of New Zealand and the United States, where it can become invasive.</p>
<p>The acacia's ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration.</p>
