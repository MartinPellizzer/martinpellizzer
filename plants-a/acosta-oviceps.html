                <h1>Acosta oviceps</h1>
<p>Acosta oviceps, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Acosta oviceps thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta oviceps has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring about 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slight ridged texture, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta oviceps is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes within the Andes. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates, often growing at elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters. It is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Andean ecosystem, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acosta oviceps is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta oviceps was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant's introduction is likely due to human activities, including accidental seed dispersal through transportation. It has established itself in native plant communities, sometimes outcompeting local species.</p>
<p>However, its impact on the ecosystem is still being studied by botanists and environmental scientists.</p>
