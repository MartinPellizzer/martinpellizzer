<p>Aechmea longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central water-holding cup. The leaves are long, stiff, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea longicuspis has leaves that are strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a bright green color and a waxy texture, reaching up to 50 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem covered in a smooth, dark green bark, growing upright from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, with purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing small, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
