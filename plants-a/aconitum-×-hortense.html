Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Aconitum × hortense is valued in gardens for its striking floral display and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × hortense has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its showy flowers are blue to purple, with five petals and a spurs, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × hortense is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and botanical gardens across temperate regions worldwide. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade, often in woodland or meadow environments. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × hortense is a striking perennial plant known for its tall, spiky flowers and dark green foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle begins with spring growth, followed by summer blooming, and it enters dormancy in late fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning of dead foliage in autumn promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its ornamental appeal and supports a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum × hortense is a striking perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in garden ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic and ecological value of the surrounding flora. While it does not fix nitrogen, it helps in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a valuable role in supporting pollinators and enhancing the ecological balance of its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum × hortense is a hybrid plant primarily cultivated for its ornamental value, showcasing striking blue or purple flowers that make it a popular choice in gardens and landscaping.</p>
