                <h1>Acinodendron quintuplinerve</h1>
<p>Acinodendron quintuplinerve, commonly known as the five-veined acinodendron, is a tropical plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with five distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with five petals, and it produces small, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>The species is native to regions in Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron quintuplinerve has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron quintuplinerve is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in forest edges and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Philippines and Sumatra.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron quintuplinerve was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf structure and aesthetic appeal. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have raised ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
