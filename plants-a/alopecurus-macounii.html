                    <h1>Alopecurus macounii</h1>
<p>Alopecurus macounii, commonly known as Macoun's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purplish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Alopecurus macounii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in wetland environments.</p>
