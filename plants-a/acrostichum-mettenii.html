                <h1>Acrostichum mettenii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum mettenii, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum mettenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mettenii has large, feather-like leaves that are elongated, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spadices, which are typically greenish-yellow in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mettenii is primarily native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, including New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salt exposure. This plant is commonly found in tidal zones and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southern and eastern coasts of the Australian mainland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mettenii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies such as streams, ponds, and wetlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>However, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats if not managed properly.</p>
