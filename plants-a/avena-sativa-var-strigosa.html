                    <h1>Avena sativa var. strigosa</h1>
<p>Avena sativa var. strigosa, commonly known as rough oat, is a variant of the oat species characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with spikelets that bear small, oval-shaped grains. Its foliage is often more rugged and less palatable compared to other oat varieties, making it less suitable for human consumption but valuable for forage or erosion control.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variety include its distinctive pubescence and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
