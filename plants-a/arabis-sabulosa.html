                    <h1>Arabis sabulosa</h1>
<p>Arabis sabulosa, commonly known as sand arabis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal areas. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
