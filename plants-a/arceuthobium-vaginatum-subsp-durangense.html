<p>Arceuthobium vaginatum subsp.</p>
<p>durangense, commonly known as the Durango dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the mountainous regions of Durango, Mexico, and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitats.</p>
