                    <h1>Arceuthobium campylopodum var. brachyarthron</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum var. brachyarthron, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically attaches to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of leaves and stems. Its unique reproductive strategy involves releasing tiny seeds that can be dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions but can also be a concern for agricultural crops.</p>
