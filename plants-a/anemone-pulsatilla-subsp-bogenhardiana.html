<p>Anemone pulsatilla subsp.</p>
<p>bogenhardiana, commonly known as the Bogenhard's pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color, appearing in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
