                <h1>Acrostichum terminans</h1>
<p>Acrostichum terminans, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a rare trait among ferns, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum terminans has long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops vertical ridges as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>
