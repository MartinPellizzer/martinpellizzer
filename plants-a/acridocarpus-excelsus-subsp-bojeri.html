<p>Acridocarpus excelsus subsp.</p>
<p>bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other plants like the cashew and mango.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus subsp.</p>
<p>bojeri has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a length ranging from 10 to 20 cm and a width of 2 to 5 cm, typically dark green in color. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus subsp.</p>
<p>bojeri is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. Its current distribution is primarily restricted to the eastern part of the island, where it thrives in humid and tropical environments. This subspecies is typically found in lowland to mid-altitude areas, ranging from approximately 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus subsp.</p>
<p>bojeri is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care. It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, making it suitable for long-term cultivation. It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ginger can enhance its growth and create a lush, vibrant garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus subsp.</p>
<p>bojeri is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports biodiversity by offering a habitat for small mammals and insects.</p>
