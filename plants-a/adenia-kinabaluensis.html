                <h1>Adenia kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Adenia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean Adenia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia kinabaluensis has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers on separate plants, and are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in clusters; they bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that matures in late summer, and the seeds are small, smooth, and dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia kinabaluensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This rare plant is found in the montane rainforests of the northern part of the island. It is typically associated with higher elevations, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The species is known for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia kinabaluensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species found in specific high-altitude regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations to its native habitat. The distribution data highlights its limited range, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts. This introduction helps in documenting its presence and supporting further research on its ecological role.</p>
<p>The data also aids in understanding the potential impacts of environmental changes on this species.</p>
