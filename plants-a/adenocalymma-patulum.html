                <h1>Adenocalymma patulum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma patulum, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble bells. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma patulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma patulum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring around 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the winter months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma patulum is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid environments, such as rainforests and moist woodlands. Adenocalymma patulum is known for its unique floral structures and is often found in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the Amazon and Andean regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma patulum was mainly introduced to regions with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with full sun exposure and well-drained soils, making it common in disturbed landscapes such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly, which contributes to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and impact on native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in areas where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
