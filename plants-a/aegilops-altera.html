                <h1>Aegilops altera</h1>
<p>Aegilops altera, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilops altera is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops altera has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and vary in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, growing in a spreading pattern. The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a spikelet that contains small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
