<p>Abronia nana var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
