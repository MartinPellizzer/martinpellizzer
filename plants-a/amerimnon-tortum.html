<p>Native to the tropical rainforests of South America, it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. The plant's stems exhibit a distinctive helical twisting, which may aid in light absorption and structural support. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically yellow or greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
