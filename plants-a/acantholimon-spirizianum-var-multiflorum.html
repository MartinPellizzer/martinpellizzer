The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon spirizianum var. multiflorum is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and limestone soils in mountainous areas. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often seen in open woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the climate of the region, with its succulent leaves helping it retain moisture.</p>
