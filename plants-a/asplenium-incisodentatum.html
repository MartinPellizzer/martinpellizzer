                    <h1>Asplenium incisodentatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium incisodentatum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen, and often creeping habit, with fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorangia, which are clustered in dense, dark green to brown clusters on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks, soil, or tree trunks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium incisodentatum is a primitive fern with a simple yet distinctive morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
