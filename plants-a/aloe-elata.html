                    <h1>Aloe elata</h1>
<p>Aloe elata, commonly known as the tall aloe or mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom during the warmer months. Aloe elata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
