<p>Arenaria ligericina, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria ligericina is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>
