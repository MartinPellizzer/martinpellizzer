<p>Alsine confertiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Alsine confertiflora is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
