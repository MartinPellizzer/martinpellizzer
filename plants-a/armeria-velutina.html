<p>Armeria velutina, commonly known as velvet sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal areas of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Armeria velutina is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
