                    <h1>Artemisia glacialis var. umbelliformis</h1>
<p>Artemisia glacialis var. umbelliformis, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cold, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its umbellate inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive, clustered appearance.</p>
