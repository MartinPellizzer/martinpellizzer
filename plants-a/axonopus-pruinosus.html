<p>Axonopus pruinosus, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often carpeting the ground in shaded or moist environments. The leaves are narrow, slightly folded, and covered with a fine, velvety bloom that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions.</p>
