<p>Ebeneum serrated fern, scientifically known as Asplenium ebeneum f. serratum, is a unique and lesser-known species of fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments. This fern is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other members of the Asplenium genus. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dense undergrowth. Its compact growth habit and intricate fronds make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts. Despite its beauty and ecological importance, it remains a relatively obscure plant in the broader horticultural community.</p>
