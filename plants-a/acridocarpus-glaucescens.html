                <h1>Acridocarpus glaucescens</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens, commonly known as the kew tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and mango. The tree is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a dense canopy that provides shade.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical or ovate leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellow petals and green sepals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens is primarily native to Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. Acridocarpus glaucescens is often seen in dry savannas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat supports a variety of local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some areas of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with human-modified landscapes. Its introduction has been linked to both intentional cultivation for ornamental purposes and accidental spread through human activity.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented in many regions.</p>
