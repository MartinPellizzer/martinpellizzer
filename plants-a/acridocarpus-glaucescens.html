                <h1>Acridocarpus glaucescens</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens, commonly known as the silky oak, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The wood of the silky oak is hard and durable, making it useful for construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a shrub-like habit. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered rare. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in lowland forests or along coastal areas. This species typically occurs at altitudes below 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is currently listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens is a hardy, ornamental shrub known for its attractive foliage and resilience in various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method offering faster results. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry out between sessions. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and promote air circulation are essential for its health. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though occasional infestations of aphids or scale may occur.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
