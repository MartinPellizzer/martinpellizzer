                    <h1>Aspalathus pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Aspalathus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained soils and requiring minimal water. It is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) but is distinguished by its smaller size and unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
