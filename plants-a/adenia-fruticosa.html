                <h1>Adenia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Adenia fruticosa, commonly known as the rock fig, is a woody shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Randiaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenia fruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia fruticosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with a bushy growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white or pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia fruticosa is primarily native to KwaZulu-Natal, Northern Provinces, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of southern Africa. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of suitable humidity and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia fruticosa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowers. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
