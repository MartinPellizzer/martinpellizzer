<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its columnar stems and clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
