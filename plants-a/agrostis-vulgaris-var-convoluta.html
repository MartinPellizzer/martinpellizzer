                    <h1>Agrostis vulgaris var. convoluta</h1>
<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. convoluta, commonly known as curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and creeping growth habit, which allows it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
