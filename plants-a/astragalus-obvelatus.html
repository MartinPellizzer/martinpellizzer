                    <h1>Astragalus obvelatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus obvelatus, commonly known as the oblong milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with oval to oblong leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Astragalus obvelatus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
