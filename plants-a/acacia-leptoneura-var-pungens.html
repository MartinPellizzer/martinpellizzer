                    <h1>Acacia leptoneura var. pungens</h1>
<p>Acacia leptoneura var. pungens, commonly known as the spiny wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
