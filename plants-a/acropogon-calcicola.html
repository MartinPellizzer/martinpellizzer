                <h1>Acropogon calcicola</h1>
<p>Acropogon calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola acropogon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or limestone areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropogon calcicola has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a gray-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture that is usually a dull brown, and it grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in rocky or calcareous soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon calcicola is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this French overseas territory. The plant typically grows in limestone soils, which are characteristic of the island's unique geology. It is often associated with rocky and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in New Caledonia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon calcicola was mainly introduced to areas with calcareous soils, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly substrates where it can access adequate sunlight. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, quarries, and dry grasslands. Its introduction has been documented in several European countries, including France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>
