                    <h1>Aegilops speltoides var. submutica</h1>
<p>Aegilops speltoides var. submutica, commonly known as the rough wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species.</p>
<p>It is native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rough, bristly leaves and spikes, which help it withstand harsh conditions. It possesses a diploid genome and is closely related to Triticum species, making it a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often used in breeding programs to enhance traits such as disease resistance and yield.</p>
