<p>Aspidium paucicuspe, commonly known as the sparse-leaf water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
