                <h1>Aconitum gassanense</h1>
<p>Aconitum gassanense, commonly known as the Gassan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Aconitum gassanense is adapted to grow in rocky and limestone soils, typically at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum gassanense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, arranged in racemes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two smaller petals, blooming from late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gassanense is primarily native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of Honshu, particularly in the northern and central areas. This species thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is often associated with areas of high altitude where the climate is temperate and humid.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat in Japan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gassanense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in woodland edges, meadows, and along streambanks where it can receive adequate moisture. This plant is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It has been introduced to several European countries as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
