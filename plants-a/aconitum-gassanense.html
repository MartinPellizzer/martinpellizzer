                    <h1>Aconitum gassanense</h1>
<p>Aconitum gassanense, commonly known as the Gassan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Aconitum gassanense is adapted to grow in rocky and limestone soils, typically at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
