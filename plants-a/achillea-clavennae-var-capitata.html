                <h1>Achillea clavennae var. capitata</h1>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. capitata, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. capitata has leaves that are basal, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs, and they are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is herbaceous and branching towards the upper part. The flowers are arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called corymbs, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. capitata is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern France, Italy, and parts of Spain.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in southern Europe, it has been introduced to other regions, including North America, where it is now cultivated in gardens and naturalized in some areas. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variety is generally stable, though it may be threatened by habitat loss and invasive species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. capitata is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental value and easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a typical growth cycle, blooming in early summer and dying back in winter, with new growth emerging in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. capitata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and a habitat for nesting. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to deter pests. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. capitata is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and its historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it has been historically valued for its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to the horticultural trade and may be used in the production of essential oils. Culturally, it has symbolic associations with healing and protection, often referenced in folklore and poetry.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. capitata has several popular cultivars, including 'Achillea clavennae 'Capitata'', which is known for its compact growth and dense, dark green foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly found in hybrid forms that combine traits from other Achillea species, such as improved cold hardiness and extended blooming periods. These hybrids are often favored in gardens for their ability to thrive in a range of conditions. The horticultural importance of this variety lies in its ornamental value, particularly its attractive, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white.</p>
<p>It is widely used in rock gardens, borders, and as a filler plant due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
