<p>Aspalthium acaulis, commonly known as the barren aspalthium, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is typically found in rocky, alpine environments. The plant lacks stems and has a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and clustered in umbels, producing a pale yellow to greenish hue.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Aspalthium acaulis is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
