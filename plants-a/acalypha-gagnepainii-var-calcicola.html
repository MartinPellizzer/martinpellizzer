                <h1>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone acalypha, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, and is adapted to grow in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, typically greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining, alkaline soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and they exhibit an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white bracts and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp, dispersing via wind due to its lightweight, hairy seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, where it grows in rocky, calcareous soils. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on limestone outcrops and rocky slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola is a striking ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, colorful foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and requiring full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with succulents or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, colorful flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in dryland ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing fragile landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil structure in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary practices, it may hold potential for local traditional recipes. Its medicinal applications are not well-documented, but some indigenous communities may use it for its potential healing properties. In terms of industrial and economic value, it has not been extensively explored for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain local traditions, though further research is needed to fully understand its role.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Variegata' and 'Lemon Queen', which showcase striking foliage with variegated patterns.</p>
<p>While there are limited hybrids specifically developed for this variety, it is often crossbred with other Acalypha species to enhance flower color and foliage texture. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in sunny conditions and its use in landscape design, particularly in tropical and subtropical gardens. The plant's unique appearance makes it a desirable choice for collectors and gardeners seeking exotic ornamental plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is less commonly cultivated than other Acalypha species.</p>
