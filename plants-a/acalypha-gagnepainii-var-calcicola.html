                    <h1>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone acalypha, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions with limestone soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is adapted to grow in calcareous (limestone) substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available.</p>
