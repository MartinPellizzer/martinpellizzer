                <h1>Acer truncatum subsp. quelpaertense</h1>
<p>Acer truncatum subsp.</p>
<p>quelpaertense, commonly known as the Jeju maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Korean Peninsula, particularly Jeju Island. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum subsp.</p>
<p>quelpaertense has palmately lobed leaves that are typically five-lobed, with a rounded or slightly notched tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. The stem is slender and somewhat zigzagging, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, with a simple structure that facilitates wind pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod, which disperses via wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum subsp.</p>
<p>quelpaertense is a rare maple species native to the Korean Peninsula, specifically South Korea. While its native range was historically limited to the island of Jeju, it is now also found in parts of Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum subsp.</p>
<p>quelpaertense is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The tree grows best in spring and summer, reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after leaf fall help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum subsp.</p>
<p>quelpaertense is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its dense foliage offers protection to smaller plants and animals, contributing to ecological stability.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum subsp.</p>
<p>quelpaertense is a deciduous tree native to Korea, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
<p>In industrial contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and provides habitat for various wildlife species. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in Korean landscapes and is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Its role in conservation and environmental restoration further highlights its importance in ecological applications.</p>
