                <h1>Adiantum alomae</h1>
<p>Adiantum alomae, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the humid forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with a silvery hue. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, graceful appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Adiantum alomae is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions, making it suitable for indoor cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum alomae has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, typically measuring 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green and glossy, arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright with a smooth, light brown bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, featuring separate male and female structures, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, club-shaped capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum alomae is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in humid and shaded environments. This fern thrives in forest understories and along stream banks. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Cuba, making it a regionally significant species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from degradation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum alomae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds. Its introduction has been linked to horticultural trade and accidental spread through human activity.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range.</p>
