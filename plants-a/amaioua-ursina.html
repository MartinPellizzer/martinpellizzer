                    <h1>Amaioua ursina</h1>
<p>Amaioua ursina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spindle-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Amaioua ursina is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in furniture and carving.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
