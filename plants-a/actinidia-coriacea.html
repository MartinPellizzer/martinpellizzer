                <h1>Actinidia coriacea</h1>
<p>Actinidia coriacea, commonly known as the rough actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food for wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in horticulture for its adaptability to various soil types and climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia coriacea has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown, and they grow as shrubs or small trees. The flowers are small, actinomorphic, and white to pale yellow, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, green, fuzzy berry that turns yellow or red when ripe, dispersed by birds and animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spreading, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia coriacea is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. It is particularly abundant in the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its edible berries and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia coriacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and berries. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and disturbed areas, allowing it to spread rapidly. It competes with native plants for resources, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
