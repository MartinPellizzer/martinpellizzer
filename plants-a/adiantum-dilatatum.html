                <h1>Adiantum dilatatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum dilatatum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually light green and have a distinctive, arching growth habit.</p>
<p>Adiantum dilatatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum dilatatum has fronds that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, with a lanceolate to ovate shape, and are dark green in color, often with a bluish tinge. The stems are slender and creeping, with a smooth, light green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dilatatum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern thrives in shaded environments with high humidity. Its native range extends from New England down through the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the southeastern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dilatatum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was initially brought for ornamental purposes due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant has since established itself in moist, shaded areas across the eastern United States. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in various ecosystems, though it is not considered highly invasive.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in other humid environments.</p>
