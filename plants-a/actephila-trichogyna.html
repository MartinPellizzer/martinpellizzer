                <h1>Actephila trichogyna</h1>
<p>Actephila trichogyna, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed actephila, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. It produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that are often overlooked due to their size.</p>
<p>Actephila trichogyna is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila trichogyna has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a creeping or upright manner depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila trichogyna is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This species is found in the diverse tropical rainforest ecosystems of the island. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant is commonly observed in the understory layers of dense forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific regions within New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila trichogyna was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, gardens, and urban environments. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
