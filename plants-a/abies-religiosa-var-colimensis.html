<p>Abies religiosa var. colimensis, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of other fir species. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often growing in mountainous forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
