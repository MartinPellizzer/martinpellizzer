                    <h1>Asplenium chimborazense</h1>
<p>Asplenium chimborazense, commonly known as the Chimborazo spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, specifically in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Asplenium chimborazense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
