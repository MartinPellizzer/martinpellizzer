                <h1>Adicea cephalantha</h1>
<p>Adicea cephalantha, commonly known as the Cape mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing shrub form with small, leathery leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Adicea cephalantha thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea cephalantha has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface, typically measuring about 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a pale brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea cephalantha is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and Mpumalanga. This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. It is often associated with forest undergrowth and is well adapted to the humid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adicea cephalantha is also occasionally found in parts of Zimbabwe and Mozambique.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea cephalantha was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
