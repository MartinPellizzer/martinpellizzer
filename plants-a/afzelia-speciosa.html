                    <h1>Afzelia speciosa</h1>
<p>Afzelia speciosa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
