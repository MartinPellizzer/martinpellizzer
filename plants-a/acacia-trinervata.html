                        <h1>Acacia trinervata</h1>
<p>Acacia trinervata, commonly known as the narrow-veined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves with three nerves per leaflet. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Acacia trinervata is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
