                <h1>Aconitum lasiocarpum subsp. kotulae</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Aconitum lasiocarpum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulaa, commonly known as the Kotula's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August.</p>
<p>The plant features palmately compound leaves with deeply cut lobes, and its stems are usually sparsely hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires caution due to its potent alkaloid content.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath, with a rough, hairy texture; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright and cylindrical with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae is a rare alpine plant native to the mountain ranges of Central Asia, particularly in regions of Kazakhstan and eastern Uzbekistan. Its current distribution is limited to specific high-altitude areas within these regions, where it thrives in rocky and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>It prefers cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous terrain. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat degradation and limited geographic range, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae is a striking perennial plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It can be propagated through division of rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring.</p>
<p>The growth cycle begins with new foliage emerging in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, after which the plant goes dormant in winter. For optimal growth, it requires consistent watering and regular applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring. Pruning dead foliage in late fall helps maintain its health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and fungal issues in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide a natural habitat for beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its striking blue-violet flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the overall health of the ecosystem. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its deep root system, stabilizing soil in wetland and riparian areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small invertebrates and microorganisms in the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae is a lesser-known variant of the aconite genus, primarily valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture due to its striking purple flowers. While it is not used in culinary applications, it has historical significance in traditional medicine, where its alkaloids were once used for pain relief and as a poison.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic nature, it is not employed in industrial or economic sectors. Culturally, it symbolizes danger and beauty, often featured in botanical art and literature.</p>
<p>Its role remains largely ecological and aesthetic, with limited practical applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Aconitum lasiocarpum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulaa has several popular cultivars that are favored for their striking blue-purple flowers and hardy nature, such as 'Blue Beauty' and 'Purpureum'. This subspecies is also used in hybridization to create new varieties with improved traits, including enhanced cold tolerance and longer blooming periods.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving A. lasiocarpum subsp. kotulae often combine the vigor of other aconitum species with its unique coloration. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and its role in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Gardeners appreciate it for adding dramatic visual impact to shady garden spaces.</p>
