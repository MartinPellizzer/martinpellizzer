                    <h1>Anthemis halophila</h1>
<p>Anthemis halophila, commonly known as saltbush or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and arid environments, showcasing its halophytic nature by tolerating high salt concentrations in the soil. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense, spherical heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Anthemis halophila is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
