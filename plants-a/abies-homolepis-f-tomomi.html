<p>Abies homolepis f. tomomi, commonly known as the Tomomi fir, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the fir tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly curved. The cones are typically small and reddish-brown when mature, and they release seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
