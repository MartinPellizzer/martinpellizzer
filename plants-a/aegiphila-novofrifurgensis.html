                <h1>Aegiphila novofrifurgensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila novofrifurgensis, commonly known as the Chilean shrub, is a perennial plant native to the Andean regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila novofrifurgensis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, greyish bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale pink color, and bloom during the summer months, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>
