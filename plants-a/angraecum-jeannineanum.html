<p>Angraecum jeannineanum, commonly known as the Jeannine's orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, long, white spathes that resemble candles. The plant produces fragrant, nocturnal flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as moths, due to its scent and flowering time. Angraecum jeannineanum is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its rarity and the specialized adaptations that make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
