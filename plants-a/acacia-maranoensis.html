<p>Acacia maranoensis, commonly known as the Maranoa wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in compact clusters. Acacia maranoensis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is found in the semi-arid regions of Queensland.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for small fauna.</p>
