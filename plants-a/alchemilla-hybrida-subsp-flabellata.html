<p>Alchemilla hybrida subsp.</p>
<p>flabellata, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are soft to the touch.</p>
<p>The plant produces upright stems with clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
