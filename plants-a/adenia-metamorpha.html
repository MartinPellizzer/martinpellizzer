                <h1>Adenia metamorpha</h1>
<p>Adenia metamorpha, commonly known as the African star apple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring a woody stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow-orange berry that contains several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical characteristics make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia metamorpha has elliptical, glossy leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green color and a smooth surface, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal spikes, blooming during the wet season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia metamorpha is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the eastern and northern regions of the island. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests. Adenia metamorpha is adapted to the humid and warm climate of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a climbing plant that thrives in the island's unique ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia metamorpha was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections due to its ornamental value and unique foliage. It prefers partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>However, it may become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed.</p>
