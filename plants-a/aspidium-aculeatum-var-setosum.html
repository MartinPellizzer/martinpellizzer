                    <h1>Aspidium aculeatum var. setosum</h1>
<p>Aspidium aculeatum var. setosum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds with a dense covering of fine, bristly hairs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
