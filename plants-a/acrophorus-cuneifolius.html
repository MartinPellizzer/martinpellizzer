                <h1>Acrophorus cuneifolius</h1>
<p>Acrophorus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acrophorus, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus cuneifolius has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus cuneifolius is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments where it can receive ample sunlight and moisture. This plant is commonly found in the undergrowth of dense forests, often growing along riverbanks and in swampy areas. Its natural range extends across parts of Central and West Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and deforestation, its distribution has become increasingly fragmented in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus cuneifolius was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, palm-like appearance. The plant has since become established in certain regions, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. However, it is not considered invasive and has not spread widely beyond its initial planting sites.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains limited and controlled in the introduced environment.</p>
