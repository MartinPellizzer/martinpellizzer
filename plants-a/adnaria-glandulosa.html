                <h1>Adnaria glandulosa</h1>
<p>Adnaria glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular adnaria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. Adnaria glandulosa is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its glandular surfaces and distinctive appearance make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria glandulosa has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and range in size from 2 to 5 cm in length; they are typically dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom in spring; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria glandulosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along coastal areas, particularly in rocky or sandy shores. This plant thrives in saline and coastal environments, often growing in shallow waters or on tidal flats. Its distribution extends to the eastern Mediterranean, such as the Levant and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally reported in the Canary Islands and other Atlantic coastal regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria glandulosa was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in regions with shallow, sandy substrates.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate salinity and sufficient sunlight. This plant is commonly found in intertidal zones where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as coastal development and marine aquaculture.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many parts of its range and may compete with native flora.</p>
