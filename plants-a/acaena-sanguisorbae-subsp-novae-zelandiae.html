<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>novae-zelandiae, commonly known as New Zealand bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly stems and small, spiny leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>novae-zelandiae is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>novae-zelandiae was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The plant is considered invasive in some parts of New Zealand, where it can outcompete native species and alter ecosystem dynamics. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to produce large quantities of seeds and establish quickly in new habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its distribution and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
