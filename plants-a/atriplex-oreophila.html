<p>Atriplex oreophila, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant belongs to the Chenopodiaceae family, which includes many species adapted to harsh conditions. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>Atriplex oreophila plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat and forage for wildlife.</p>
