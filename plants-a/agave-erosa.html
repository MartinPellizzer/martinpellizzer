                    <h1>Agave erosa</h1>
<p>Agave erosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by fleshy, green berries. Agave erosa is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
