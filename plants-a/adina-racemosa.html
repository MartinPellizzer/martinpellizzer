                <h1>Adina racemosa</h1>
<p>Adina racemosa, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by dark red or black berries. Adina racemosa is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in traditional crafts and carving.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina racemosa has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually 3–6 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, drooping racemes during the spring, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release three seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina racemosa is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, Japan, Myanmar, Nansei-shoto, Taiwan, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in moist, tropical, and subtropical climates. It is often seen growing in shaded understory conditions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans across East Asia, including several island groups and mainland countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina racemosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has become established in disturbed areas such as roadsides, forest edges, and stream banks. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread into native habitats. It is considered a potential invasive species due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its distribution and prevent further spread.</p>
