<p>Arthraxon echinatus, commonly known as the spiny grass or rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern and eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
