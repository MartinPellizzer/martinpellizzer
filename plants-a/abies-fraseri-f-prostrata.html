                        <h1>Abies fraseri f. prostrata</h1>
<p>Abies fraseri f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate Fraser fir, is a rare and unique form of the Fraser fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit, which distinguishes it from the typical upright growth of the species. The plant features scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in specific microhabitats, reflecting its adaptation to particular environmental conditions.</p>
