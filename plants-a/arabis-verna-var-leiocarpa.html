<p>It typically features basal leaves that are smooth and rounded, with a rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, often appearing before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smoother leaf surfaces compared to other varieties of Arabis verna.</p>
