                <h1>Actinodaphne concolor</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne concolor, commonly known as the smooth-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate, and often glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its aromatic leaves and bark contain essential oils, making it valuable in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne concolor has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale grey bark that peels in thin, fibrous layers, and it grows upright with a moderate rate. The flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical drupe with a smooth, dark purple skin, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne concolor is primarily native to Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is commonly encountered in primary and secondary forest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is restricted to specific areas within Myanmar, where it plays a role in the local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne concolor was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Indonesia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its distribution has expanded due to horticultural trade and intentional cultivation for landscaping purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
