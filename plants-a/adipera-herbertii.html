                <h1>Adipera herbertii</h1>
<p>Adipera herbertii, commonly known as Herbert's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the plantain family, Plantaginaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and adaptability to harsh conditions make it both ecologically and horticulturally significant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipera herbertii has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
