<p>Abronia pedunculata, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Abronia pedunculata plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds.</p>
