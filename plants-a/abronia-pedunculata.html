                        <h1>Abronia pedunculata</h1>
<p>Abronia pedunculata, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Abronia pedunculata plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia pedunculata is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with minimal vegetation. This plant is commonly found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and development, its distribution has become increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia pedunculata was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained environments and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant is commonly introduced to the western United States, including states like California and Oregon. It has also been reported in parts of Australia and New Zealand due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as landscaping and land development.</p>
