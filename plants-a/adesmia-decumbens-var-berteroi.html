                    <h1>Adesmia decumbens var. berteroi</h1>
<p>Adesmia decumbens var. berteroi, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a waxy coating that helps conserve moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
