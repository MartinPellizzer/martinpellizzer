                <h1>Adenocarpus decorticans</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus decorticans, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus decorticans is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus decorticans has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown in color, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus decorticans is primarily native to Algeria, Morocco, and Spain.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the Mediterranean regions of these countries. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with semi-arid environments. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus decorticans was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the edges of forests, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
