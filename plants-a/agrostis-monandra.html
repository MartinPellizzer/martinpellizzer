                    <h1>Agrostis monandra</h1>
<p>Agrostis monandra, commonly known as slender false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Agrostis monandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
