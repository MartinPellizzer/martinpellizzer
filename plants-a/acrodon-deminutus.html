                <h1>Acrodon deminutus</h1>
<p>Acrodon deminutus, commonly known as the dwarf acrodon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy foliage. The plant features a compact growth habit with numerous small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Acrodon deminutus is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodon deminutus has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodon deminutus is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the western and southern regions of the Cape Provinces in South Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and mountainous areas. Acrodon deminutus is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open habitats such as fynbos vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodon deminutus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
