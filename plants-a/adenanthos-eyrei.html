                <h1>Adenanthos eyrei</h1>
<p>Adenanthos eyrei, commonly known as the coastal adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Adenanthos eyrei is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos eyrei has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white, and clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's rocky, well-drained habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos eyrei is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the town of Geraldton. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and near-coastal habitats. It is part of the Proteaceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Adenanthos eyrei is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of Western Australia, with periods of dry summers and wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos eyrei was mainly introduced to South Australia and western New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in areas with a Mediterranean climate. The plant is often associated with open woodlands and heathlands. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural range.</p>
