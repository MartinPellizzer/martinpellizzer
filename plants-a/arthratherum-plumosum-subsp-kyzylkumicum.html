<p>Arthratherum plumosum subsp.</p>
<p>kyzylkumicum, commonly known as the Kyzylkum feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
