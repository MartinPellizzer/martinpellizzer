<p>Asplenium balearicum, commonly known as the Balearic spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with closely clustered fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium balearicum is often found in limestone soils and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
