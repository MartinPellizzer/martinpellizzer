                <h1>Adinandra lienii</h1>
<p>Adinandra lienii, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is considered an endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra lienii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits to release smooth, black seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lienii is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Vietnam.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lienii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range due to horticultural interest and climate change.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
