                <h1>Adenocalymma fistulosum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma fistulosum, commonly known as the slender bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the fruits are pods that are inflated and often contain a single seed.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma fistulosum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dull green color and serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish color, and it grows in a spreading or upright pattern depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, and they bloom during the cooler months, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma fistulosum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of this area, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. This plant thrives in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. It is commonly found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific region within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma fistulosum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils, particularly in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained environments and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. This plant is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it common in estuarine and coastal habitats. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in non-native regions, where it can compete with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is occasionally used in restoration projects to stabilize eroding shorelines.</p>
