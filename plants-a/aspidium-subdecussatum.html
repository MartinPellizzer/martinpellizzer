<p>Aspidium subdecussatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Aspidium subdecussatum is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
