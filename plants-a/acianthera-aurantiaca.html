<p>Acianthera aurantiaca, commonly known as the Orange Orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange flowers and is often found in humid, tropical environments. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Acianthera aurantiaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera aurantiaca has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a vibrant orange color and a tubular structure, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera aurantiaca is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various botanical gardens and private collections around the world. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth areas. It is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Acianthera aurantiaca is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
