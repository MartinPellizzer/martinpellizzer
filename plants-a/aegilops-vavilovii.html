                <h1>Aegilops vavilovii</h1>
<p>Aegilops vavilovii, commonly known as the Vavilov's wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. This plant is notable for its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat, making it an important species in wheat evolution studies. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aegilops vavilovii is also valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and yield.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops vavilovii has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, pale green surface, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spikelet that contains small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently.</p>
