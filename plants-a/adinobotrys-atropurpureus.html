                <h1>Adinobotrys atropurpureus</h1>
<p>Adinobotrys atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple-leafed hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep purple or bronze color. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adinobotrys atropurpureus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys atropurpureus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark purple to reddish coloration on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys atropurpureus is primarily native to Cambodia, Jawa, Laos, Malaya, Myanmar, Sumatera, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in lowland areas with humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests or disturbed habitats. The species is known for its distinctive purple foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions across Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys atropurpureus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, dark purple foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant for gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown potential to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study, as it is not yet classified as a major invasive species.</p>
