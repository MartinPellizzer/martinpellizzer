                <h1>Aconitum tamuranum</h1>
<p>Aconitum tamuranum, commonly known as the Tibetan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive hooded shape, typical of the Aconitum genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tamuranum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in racemes, and have a spurred petal, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tamuranum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, typically at elevations above 2,000 meters. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and grasslands, often growing in moist and well-drained areas. It is adapted to the cold climate and short growing season of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tamuranum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or forested environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with cool summers and cold winters. The plant is commonly cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It prefers rich, loamy soil and can tolerate some degree of shade but performs best with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to various parts of the world beyond its native range.</p>
