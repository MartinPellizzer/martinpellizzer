                <h1>Acronychia peninsularis</h1>
<p>Acronychia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular acronychia, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Acronychia peninsularis is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Its wood is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of gum resins.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia peninsularis has alternate, elliptical or ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, compact form. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals and stamens, blooming in spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in its coastal habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia peninsularis is a rare tropical plant native to the island of Borneo, specifically found in the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within lowland and hill forests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typically growing in the understorey of dense tropical rainforests. The plant is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, Acronychia peninsularis is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acronychia peninsularis is a hardy evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions with partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer, and prune to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract scale insects or mealybugs in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acronychia peninsularis is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its fragrant flowers and nutritious fruit. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in the ecosystem. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil on coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to maintaining biodiversity by offering ecological benefits to both flora and fauna.</p>
