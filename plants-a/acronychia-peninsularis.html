                <h1>Acronychia peninsularis</h1>
<p>Acronychia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia peninsularis has simple, alternate, elliptic or ovate leaves that are usually glossy green in color, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically dark brown to black in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, compact growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters, and have a simple structure with five petals; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia peninsularis is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It is commonly associated with rainforests and moist environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Queensland's northeastern regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia peninsularis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and lowland forests, where its hardy nature allows it to adapt to various environmental conditions. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate urban environments. Its distribution has expanded in recent years due to increased horticultural interest and climate change factors.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native regions.</p>
