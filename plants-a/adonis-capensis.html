                <h1>Adonis capensis</h1>
<p>Adonis capensis, commonly known as the Cape buttercup, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, herbaceous stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adonis capensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis capensis has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, and covered with a smooth, greyish-brown bark. Its flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a red center, arranged in umbel-like clusters, blooming in spring and attracting insect pollinators such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis capensis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as fynbos vegetation. It is also present in parts of Namibia and southwestern Angola.</p>
<p>Adonis capensis is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis capensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>It has been established in various habitats, including coastal areas and mountainous regions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat at this time.</p>
