                <h1>Acaciella durangensis</h1>
<p>Acaciella durangensis, commonly known as the Durango acacia, is a shrub native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, making it visually distinctive. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption.</p>
<p>Acaciella durangensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaciella durangensis has small, ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 1â€“2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale gray bark that exudes a mild aromatic scent. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming from April to June, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod containing several elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaciella durangensis is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico, specifically in the states of Durango and Zacatecas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few fragmented populations within its native range due to habitat loss and human activities. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found in rocky soils and on slopes. This species grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acaciella durangensis is listed as endangered due to its restricted habitat and ongoing threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaciella durangensis is a small, drought-tolerant shrub native to Mexico, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and prefers well-drained soil with minimal watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be limited to a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is minimal and done to shape the plant. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with cacti or other succulents can enhance its growth in dry environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaciella durangensis is a shrub that provides essential food and shelter for local wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting surrounding vegetation. Its deep roots also help in preventing soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in native plant communities, enhancing biodiversity and ecological resilience.</p>
