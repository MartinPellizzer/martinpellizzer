                <h1>Aegiphila tomentosa</h1>
<p>Aegiphila tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly aegiphila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila tomentosa has hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, woolly underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, and has a pale green to grayish bark. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
