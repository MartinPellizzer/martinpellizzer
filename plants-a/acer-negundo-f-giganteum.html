                        <h1>Acer negundo f. giganteum</h1>
<p>Acer negundo f. giganteum, commonly known as the giant boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
