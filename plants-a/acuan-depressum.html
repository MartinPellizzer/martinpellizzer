                <h1>Acuan depressum</h1>
<p>Acuan depressum, commonly known as the low acuan, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Acuan depressum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan depressum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a pale greenish-brown color, exhibiting a trailing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan depressum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically the coastal regions of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. This species is commonly found in dune ecosystems and salt marshes, where it adapts to saline and fluctuating water conditions. Its distribution is limited to these specific coastal habitats, making it a rare and specialized plant.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural range from habitat loss and development.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan depressum was mainly introduced to regions with moist, temperate climates where it can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forest understories and along streambanks in its native range. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native habitat has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
