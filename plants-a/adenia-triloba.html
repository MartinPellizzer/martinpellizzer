                <h1>Adenia triloba</h1>
<p>Adenia triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed adenia, is a climbing shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenia triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia triloba has alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually green with a slight waxy coating, measuring around 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to reddish in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a smooth, spherical berry that turns red when ripe, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network underground, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia triloba is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and moist, shaded areas within these regions. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen in the understory of subtropical and tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Adenia triloba is an important component of the native flora in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia triloba was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
