<p>Anabasis brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, aiding in water retention. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, saline soils.</p>
<p>Anabasis brevifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
