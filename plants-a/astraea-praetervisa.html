                    <h1>Astraea praetervisa</h1>
<p>Astraea praetervisa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of longleaf pines. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a spongy, white tissue. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a unique, intricate structure that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Astraea praetervisa is critically endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
