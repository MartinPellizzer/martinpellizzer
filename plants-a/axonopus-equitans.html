<p>Axonopus equitans, commonly known as the flatleaf stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, flat leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family.
