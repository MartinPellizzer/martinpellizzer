                    <h1>Aspidium helveolum</h1>
<p>Aspidium helveolum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help in spreading across the water's surface. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidium helveolum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it contributes to aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
