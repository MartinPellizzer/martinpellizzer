<p>Agropyron repens subsp.</p>
<p>pseudocaesium, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, which helps in soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with florets. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
