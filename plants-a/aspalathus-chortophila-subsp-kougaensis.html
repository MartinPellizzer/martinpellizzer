<p>Aspalathus chortophila subsp.</p>
<p>kougaensis, commonly known as the Kouga bushveld cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of the Kouga region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
