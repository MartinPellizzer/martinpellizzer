<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne speciosa var. candolleana has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the rainy season, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical berry that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne speciosa var. candolleana is a rare and lesser-known variant of the genus Actinodaphne, native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily within the southern states of Karnataka and Kerala, where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. Currently, the plant is found in limited areas, often in fragmented forest patches due to habitat loss. It prefers moist, shaded environments at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and increasing threats from deforestation, the conservation status of this variant is considered vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne speciosa var. candolleana is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, prized for its fragrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
