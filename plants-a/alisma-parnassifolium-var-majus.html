                    <h1>Alisma parnassifolium var. majus</h1>
<p>Alisma parnassifolium var. majus, commonly known as the greater water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in shallow water and moist soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
