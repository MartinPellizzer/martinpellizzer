<p>Allocasuarina verticillata, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiral arrangement of needle-like phyllodes, which are modified leaves adapted for reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cylindrical cones that contain the seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>
