                    <h1>Azorella crassipes</h1>
<p>Azorella crassipes, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and strong winds. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and densely packed to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Azorella crassipes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine species.</p>
