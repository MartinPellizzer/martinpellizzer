<p>Acacia curbeloi, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Acacia curbeloi is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water absorption.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia curbeloi has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, narrow leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, typically green in color and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender and often branch out at the base, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are yellow, arranged in dense globular or cylindrical heads, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and attached tufts.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia curbeloi is a shrub native to the island of Madagascar, specifically found in the eastern part of the country.</p>
