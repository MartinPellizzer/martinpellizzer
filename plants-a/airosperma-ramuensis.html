<p>Airosperma ramuensis, commonly known as the Ramu air plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
