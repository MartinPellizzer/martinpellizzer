                <h1>Adenophora contracta</h1>
<p>Adenophora contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora contracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora contracta has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a bluish-green color, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is herbaceous, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and grows upright with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after maturing.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora contracta is primarily native to Inner Mongolia, Manchuria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to these specific regions in northeastern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora contracta was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant has been reported in several states including Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain areas.</p>
