                    <h1>Aria nivea var. edulis</h1>
<p>Aria nivea var. edulis, commonly known as the edible snowflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, star-shaped flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to the harsh, cold climate. The plant thrives in rocky soils and has a slow growth rate, making it difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor, often used in traditional local cuisines.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
