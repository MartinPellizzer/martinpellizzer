                    <h1>Avicennia marina var. resinifera</h1>
<p>Avicennia marina var. resinifera, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits a unique ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves, aiding in its survival in coastal areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by wind or insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that disperses seeds via water, contributing to its propagation in intertidal zones.</p>
