<p>Arundo mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found along coastal areas and in marshy environments. The plant can grow up to 4 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often used for thatching or as a source of fiber. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
