                <h1>Adenodolichos euryphyllus</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos euryphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically broad and trifoliate, and its erect growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to warm climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds.</p>
<p>The plant also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos euryphyllus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, medium-sized, and typically have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that is slightly rough to the touch, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are clustered in inflorescences, with small white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos euryphyllus is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including regions of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. This species is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Myanmar and Sri Lanka. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its distinctive pod-like fruits and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos euryphyllus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high temperatures and requires well-drained soil. This plant is often found in regions where its seeds have been dispersed by wind or animal activity. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a problematic weed in cultivated lands.</p>
