                    <h1>Arabidopsis pumila var. foliosa</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis pumila var. foliosa, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear cress, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is often used in ecological studies and as a model organism in plant biology research.</p>
