                    <h1>Acacia arcuatilis</h1>
<p>Acacia arcuatilis, commonly known as the warty acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, curved and warty pod-like fruits, which are a key feature of the species. The plant has phyllodes rather than true leaves, which are narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Acacia arcuatilis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
