                        <h1>Acantholimon bromifolium var. approximatum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon bromifolium var. approximatum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dunes and along the edges of tidal pools, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
