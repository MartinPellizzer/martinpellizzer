<p>Arenaria grandiflora subsp.</p>
<p>triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
