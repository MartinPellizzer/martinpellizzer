                <h1>Acantholimon gulistanum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon gulistanum, commonly known as the Gulistan's thornscale, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species in ecological studies of desert flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acantholimon gulistanum has leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching pattern towards the upper parts. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring blue to purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon gulistanum is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey, specifically in the Taurus Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the northeastern part of the country. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as slopes and grasslands. The plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat degradation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acantholimon gulistanum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant native to Central Asia, known for its ornamental foliage and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, becoming active in spring and entering dormancy in late autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage in early spring to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids in humid conditions, making it a good companion plant for lavender or thyme.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acantholimon gulistanum is a plant that provides food and shelter for various local wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for maintaining plant reproduction and ecological balance. This plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring flora by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acantholimon gulistanum plays a vital role in sustaining ecological health and resilience.</p>
