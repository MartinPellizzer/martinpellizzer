                        <h1>Abelicea sibirica</h1>
<p>Abelicea sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Its blooming period typically occurs in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelicea sibirica is primarily native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and western China.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous and steppe environments. This plant is adapted to harsh climates with low precipitation and extreme temperature fluctuations. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that support its survival in these challenging conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelicea sibirica was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and colonization.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with similar climatic conditions to its native habitat. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. It is now found in several areas outside its original range, including parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Continued monitoring is necessary to assess its ecological impact.</p>
