                <h1>Adamanthus compactus</h1>
<p>Adamanthus compactus, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 4 feet. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright blue berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly wavy edge.</p>
<p>Adamanthus compactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus compactus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's stability.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus compactus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and the lower coastal plain of South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is often associated with pine flatwood and scrub habitats, where it forms dense colonies. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a characteristic species of the region's wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus compactus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, vacant lots, and coastal dunes. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>It is often mistaken for native grasses due to its similar appearance.</p>
