                <h1>Achillea fraasii</h1>
<p>Achillea fraasii, commonly known as the Armenian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountains of Armenia and Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Achillea fraasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark, and it grows in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, composite structures with white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean, particularly found in countries like Syria, Lebanon, and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with populations primarily restricted to specific rocky and limestone habitats. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, often growing on slopes and in open grasslands. This species is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea fraasii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii is a hardy perennial plant known for its showy, yellow flowers and resilience in various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of mature plants, with division being more reliable for maintaining the plant's characteristics. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in early summer and going dormant in winter, making it ideal for spring gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after blooming helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if not properly cared for.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic compounds. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea fraasii also plays a role in improving soil health by attracting beneficial microbes and supporting a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Middle East, known for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in rocky or arid soils.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, some traditional uses involve its aromatic leaves in herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though its therapeutic use remains limited. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though specific meanings are not well documented.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems includes supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
