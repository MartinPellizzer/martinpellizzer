                <h1>Achillea fraasii</h1>
<p>Achillea fraasii, commonly known as the Fraas' yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient species in challenging ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, with a rough, grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is clump-forming. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and pale yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountains of Central Asia, particularly in regions of Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Currently, it is distributed in alpine and subalpine areas across these regions, though its range has become fragmented due to environmental changes. It thrives in dry, rocky slopes and grasslands, often in sunny, well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea fraasii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii is a perennial herbaceous plant known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea fraasii typically begins in early spring with new shoots, followed by flowering in late summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea fraasii also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, known for its medicinal properties and traditional uses.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in folk medicine to treat various ailments, including digestive issues and skin conditions. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some local communities may incorporate it into herbal infusions. Its aesthetic appeal also makes it a candidate for ornamental gardening and landscape design.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic significance remains limited compared to more widely cultivated plants.</p>
