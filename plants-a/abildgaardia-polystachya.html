                        <h1>Abildgaardia polystachya</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia polystachya, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of red, pink, and white. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Abildgaardia polystachya is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun and dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia polystachya is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia polystachya was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in natural habitats. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to thrive in various soil types.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
