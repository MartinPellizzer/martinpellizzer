                    <h1>Aspidium praetervisum</h1>
<p>Aspidium praetervisum, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular to ovate fronds that are often divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and forest floors, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
