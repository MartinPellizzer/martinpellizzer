                        <h1>Acantholimon roseum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon roseum, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon roseum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found in dry, sunny areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with Mediterranean maquis and scrublands, where it adapts to the harsh climate with its succulent leaves and deep root system. It is particularly prevalent in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in many of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon roseum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low rainfall and full sun exposure, making it suitable for xerophytic landscapes. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, where it can establish itself quickly. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of the western United States, including California and Nevada.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas where it is not native.</p>
