<p>Alnus dubia, commonly known as the Arizona alder, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. Alnus dubia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant communities.</p>
