<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is typically shrub-like, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Adhatoda sisparensis is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sisparensis has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
