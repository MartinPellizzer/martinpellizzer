                <h1>Acer robustum var. honanense</h1>
<p>Acer robustum var. honanense, commonly known as the Honan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 8–15 meters and has a rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer robustum var. honanense has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are alternately arranged on the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves typically measure 5–10 cm in length and width.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer robustum var. honanense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within these regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. This variant typically grows in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer robustum var. honanense is a hardy maple tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this tree includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer, with peak foliage in the fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials for a diverse garden landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer robustum var. honanense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and improving water retention.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the overall health of the forest by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer robustum var. honanense is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability to various soil conditions, contributing to industrial and economic applications in reforestation efforts. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions of China, where it is appreciated for its aesthetic value in landscaping. While not widely cultivated for commercial purposes, it plays a role in local biodiversity and habitat conservation.</p>
<p>Its role in environmental resilience highlights its importance in sustainable land management practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer robustum var. honanense has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', which are known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in various hybrids that combine its striking foliage with the hardiness of other maple species. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold tolerance and improved adaptability to different soil conditions. Horticulturally, Acer robustum var. honanense is valued for its unique leaf patterns and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of garden maples, making it a popular choice for landscape design.</p>
