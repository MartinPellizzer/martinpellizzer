                <h1>Adenochloa ecklonii</h1>
<p>Adenochloa ecklonii, commonly known as the coastal grass or Ecklon's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Adenochloa ecklonii is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochloa ecklonii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and typically measure about 5-10 cm in length with a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish color, and grows upright with a clumping growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are greenish-white in color and bloom during the cooler months, primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-angled capsule that disperses its tiny seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochloa ecklonii is primarily native to Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Provinces, DR Congo, Eswatini, Free State, Guinea, Ivory Coast, KwaZulu-Natal, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Northern Provinces, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with grassland and forest margins. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Adenochloa ecklonii is a valuable component of the regional flora and is adapted to the diverse environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochloa ecklonii was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the coastal regions of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It was originally native to Australia and was introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. The plant has since spread into natural habitats, posing a potential threat to local ecosystems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and can often be found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased monitoring to prevent its spread into sensitive ecological zones.</p>
