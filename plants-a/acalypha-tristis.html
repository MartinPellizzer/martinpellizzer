                        <h1>Acalypha tristis</h1>
<p>Acalypha tristis, commonly known as the weeping croton, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping inflorescences that resemble cascading ribbons. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a striking reddish-purple coloration. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, upright spikes.</p>
<p>Acalypha tristis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha tristis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. Its native range extends into Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas with rich, organic soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha tristis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, often thriving in disturbed areas and along coastal zones. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its establishment in non-native habitats. It is considered a potential invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact raises concerns for environmental management in invaded regions.</p>
