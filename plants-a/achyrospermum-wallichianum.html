                <h1>Achyrospermum wallichianum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum wallichianum, commonly known as the Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to red. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often hairy.</p>
<p>It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum wallichianum has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. The flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, with tubular corollas that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum wallichianum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas or along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it a common sight in the foothills and lower elevations of these countries. It is also occasionally reported in parts of China and the Indonesian archipelago.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the Himalayan region and adjacent areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum wallichianum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was originally native to the Indian subcontinent but was brought to Hawaii likely as an ornamental plant. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and coastal environments, spreading rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds. It poses a threat to native vegetation by outcompeting local flora for resources.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect the ecosystem.</p>
