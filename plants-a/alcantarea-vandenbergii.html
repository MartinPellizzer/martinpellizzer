                    <h1>Alcantarea vandenbergii</h1>
<p>Alcantarea vandenbergii, commonly known as the Vandenberg's Alcantarea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spiky, silver-green rosette of leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing vibrant orange or red flowers, which bloom sequentially along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
