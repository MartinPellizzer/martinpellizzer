                    <h1>Agropyron repens var. leersianum</h1>
<p>Agropyron repens var. leersianum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
