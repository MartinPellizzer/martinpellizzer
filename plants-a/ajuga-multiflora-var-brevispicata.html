                    <h1>Ajuga multiflora var. brevispicata</h1>
<p>Ajuga multiflora var. brevispicata, commonly known as narrow-spurred ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover, making it effective for erosion control.</p>
<p>It prefers moist, shaded to partly shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
