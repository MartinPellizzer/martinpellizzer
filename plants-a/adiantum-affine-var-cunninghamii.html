<p>Adiantum affine var. cunninghamii, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has a short, horizontal rhizome that supports its tall, arching fronds. Its sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings due to its adaptability and aesthetic qualities.</p>
