                <h1>Aciphylla latibracteata</h1>
<p>Aciphylla latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract snowgrass, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure with silver-gray foliage that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which provide insulation against cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Aciphylla latibracteata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla latibracteata has leaves that are narrow, needle-like, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a bluish-gray color and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing from a short, underground caudex. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, hairy capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where the plant grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla latibracteata is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, including the South Island. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as coastal cliffs and gravelly soils. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive, spine-tipped leaves.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla latibracteata was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, typically in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun exposure and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. This plant is often found in regions with low precipitation and high levels of wind exposure. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches where it can establish and persist.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is not commonly found outside of these particular environments.</p>
