<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many flowering plants with composite flowers.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is noted, though its botanical significance lies in its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>aleppica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray upper surface and a darker underside, typically measuring up to 10 cm in length. The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish color and a branching growth pattern that rises from the base.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight and carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>
