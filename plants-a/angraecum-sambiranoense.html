The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific humidity to bloom. Its unique floral structure suggests a specialized pollination mechanism, likely involving moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
