                    <h1>Arthraxon rudis</h1>
<p>Arthraxon rudis, commonly known as the rigid arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water's surface or along the bottom. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or brown, and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Arthraxon rudis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by reducing water currents and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
