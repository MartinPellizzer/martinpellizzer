                <h1>Achoriphragma darvazicum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma darvazicum, commonly known as the Darvazicum spurge, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often clustered in cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are usually alternate and have a rough texture, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma darvazicum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma darvazicum is primarily native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous and semi-desert environments. This plant is adapted to survive in extreme climatic conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. It is commonly found in elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma darvazicum was mainly introduced to areas with specific environmental conditions that support its growth, such as semi-arid regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with moderate temperatures and low precipitation, which are typical of its native habitat. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Central Asia, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it has adapted to local climates. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in new ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and is not currently considered a major threat to native flora.</p>
