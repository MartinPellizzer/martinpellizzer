                        <h1>Abarema tetraphylla</h1>
<p>Abarema tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf clover of the genus Abarema, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, though it may occasionally produce four leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pods containing several seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in grassy areas and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema tetraphylla is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across the eastern coast of the country. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical regions. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as secondary forests and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific areas within Brazil, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema tetraphylla was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is native to South America but has been spread to other regions due to its ornamental value. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is now considered a potential weed in some areas.</p>
