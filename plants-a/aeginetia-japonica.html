                <h1>Aeginetia japonica</h1>
<p>Aeginetia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese burr vine, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by clinging to animal fur. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Aeginetia japonica is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia japonica has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>
