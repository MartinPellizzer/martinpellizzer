                    <h1>Anogramma bifida</h1>
<p>Anogramma bifida, commonly known as the split spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into two parts. The plant's fronds are typically short and clustered, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a split or divided structure. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, releasing them from tiny, clustered capsules on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Anogramma bifida is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
