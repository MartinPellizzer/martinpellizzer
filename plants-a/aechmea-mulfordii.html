                <h1>Aechmea mulfordii</h1>
<p>Aechmea mulfordii, commonly known as the Mulfordâ€™s air plant, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees in humid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a tall stem bearing brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea mulfordii has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and arranged in a spiral around the central axis, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick base that supports the rosette of leaves. Its flowers are borne in a spike-like inflorescence, with violet to purple bracts that enclose small, white to pale blue flowers, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air and soil, typical of its bromeliad family.</p>
