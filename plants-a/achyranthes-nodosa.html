                <h1>Achyranthes nodosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa, commonly known as the knotted burr or nodding spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny capsules that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 3-8 cm long and 1-3 cm wide, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern that develops from the base. The small greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, blooming in summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule containing small, brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Asia, particularly India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achyranthes nodosa is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though habitat loss poses a potential threat to its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa is a hardy annual plant commonly grown for its ornamental foliage and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown directly in the garden or started indoors as seedlings, which are then transplanted after the last frost. The growth cycle of Achyranthes nodosa typically spans from spring to early autumn, with rapid growth during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning can help maintain shape and encourage branching. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew may occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its flowering structure and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
