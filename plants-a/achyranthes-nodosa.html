                <h1>Achyranthes nodosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist environments like riverbanks and wetlands. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and is often associated with disturbed soils. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into regions with monsoonal rainfall patterns, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nodosa was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as intentional planting for medicinal or ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It has since spread to various regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can establish itself in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it also provides ecological benefits by supporting local insect populations and preventing soil erosion.</p>
