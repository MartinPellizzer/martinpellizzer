                <h1>Adnaria nitida</h1>
<p>Adnaria nitida, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, while its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adnaria nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria nitida has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria nitida is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions such as southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in rocky shores and cliffs along the Mediterranean Sea. This plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often growing in dry, sunny environments. It is also present in parts of Turkey, Greece, and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Adnaria nitida is well adapted to the harsh coastal conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria nitida was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as accidental transport via shipping or intentional introduction for ornamental or ecological purposes.</p>
<p>It has established populations in coastal areas where it thrives in saline and brackish water conditions. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have allowed it to spread along shorelines and in estuarine habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, Adnaria nitida plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for certain marine organisms.</p>
