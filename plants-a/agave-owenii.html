<p>Agave owenii, commonly known as the Owen's agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous white flowers, typically blooming once in its lifetime. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Agave owenii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
