                    <h1>Alnus × koehnei</h1>
<p>Alnus × koehnei, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between *Alnus incana* (gray alder) and *Alnus rhombifolia* (broadleaf alder). The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Alnus × koehnei is often found in moist soils near streams or in wetlands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological succession.</p>
