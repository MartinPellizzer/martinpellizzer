                <h1>Achillea calcarea</h1>
<p>Achillea calcarea, commonly known as limestone yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its common name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and its preference for calcium-rich environments.</p>
<p>Achillea calcarea is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped (cordate) with a bluish-gray hue, arranged in a rosette, and are relatively small, measuring about 2–4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered with fine hairs, and has a pale green color, growing from the base to a height of 30–60 cm. The flowers are small, composite yellowish-white structures arranged in flat, circular clusters (compound umbels), blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or calcareous soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly in regions such as Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>It is now found in scattered populations across its native range, with some introduced occurrences in other parts of Europe. This plant thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is commonly found in rocky or gravelly areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea calcarea is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, flowering in summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme enhances its growth and repels pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also helps in erosion control due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its ecosystem by supporting a range of wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea is a flowering plant known for its medicinal applications, particularly in traditional medicine where it has been used to treat skin conditions and as a vulnerary to promote wound healing.</p>
<p>It also holds cultural significance, often symbolizing protection and healing in various historical contexts. While not widely used in culinary practices, it has been explored for its potential in natural dyeing processes. In industrial applications, it contributes to biodiversity and serves as a habitat for pollinators, supporting ecological balance.</p>
<p>Its role in herbal remedies and ecological systems highlights its multifaceted importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' with its yellow-green foliage and 'Palla' known for its pale pink flower heads. Hybrids of Achillea calcarea are often created to enhance flower color, growth habit, and disease resistance. These plants are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in rocky or poor soils, making them ideal for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Their long-lasting blooms and low maintenance requirements further contribute to their popularity among gardeners.</p>
