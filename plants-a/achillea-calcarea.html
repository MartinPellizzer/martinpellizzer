                <h1>Achillea calcarea</h1>
<p>Achillea calcarea, commonly known as limestone yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils, thriving in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and appear in flat-topped clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea has basal, gray-green leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, and have a rough texture with a bluish-gray hue.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant thrive in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as Italy, Spain, and France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Mediterranean region and some areas of Central Europe. It thrives in dry, rocky, and limestone-rich environments, often growing on slopes and in open grasslands. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea calcarea is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with new growth emerging in spring and flowering throughout summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea is a hardy flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering food and habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea calcarea contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in arid and rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea is a flowering plant known for its various uses and applications across different fields.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it has been traditionally used for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it may be employed in certain herbal teas or infusions. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and can support pollinators, making it relevant in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, often associated with protection and healing.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea calcarea has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Achillea calcarea' var. 'Albopunctata' and 'Achillea calcarea' var. 'Dentata', both known for their unique foliage and flowers. Hybrids such as 'Achillea x nana' have been developed to enhance vigor and bloom performance. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in rocky or poor soils and their long flowering period.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens for their aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
