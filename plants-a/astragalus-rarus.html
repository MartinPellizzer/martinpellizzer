<p>Astragalus rarus, commonly known as the rare milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a deep root system, which allows it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in alpine and steppe habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus rarus is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
