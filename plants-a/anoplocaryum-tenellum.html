                    <h1>Anoplocaryum tenellum</h1>
<p>Anoplocaryum tenellum, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Anoplocaryum tenellum plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration processes.</p>
