<p>Arenaria brevifolia, commonly known as the moss campion, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments.</p>
