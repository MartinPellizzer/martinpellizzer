<p>Adelocaryum erythraeum f. subexalatum, commonly known as the Red Sea spurge, is a rare succulent plant native to the coastal regions of the Red Sea.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
