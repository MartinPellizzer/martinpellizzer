                <h1>Actephila nitidula</h1>
<p>Actephila nitidula, commonly known as the glossy actephila, is a member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its smooth, shiny leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Actephila nitidula is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila nitidula has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 2â€“5 cm in length and arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila nitidula is primarily native to Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. The plant is often associated with humid climates and is part of the local flora in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila nitidula was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread in non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains a subject of ongoing study.</p>
