                <h1>Actinea texana</h1>
<p>Actinea texana, commonly known as the Texas starflower, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Its leaves are small, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Actinea texana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea texana has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green color and a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright, often branching out near the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, dispersed by birds and other animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea texana is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within woodland edges and open pine flatwoods. This plant is commonly found in areas with partial to full sunlight and is often associated with sandy or loamy soil types. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea texana was mainly introduced to new habitats in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its unique, colorful flowers. However, it has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various natural ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological effects and management.</p>
