                <h1>Aconitum flerovii</h1>
<p>Aconitum flerovii, commonly known as the Flerov's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum flerovii has large, palmately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, lobed shape and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, covered in a smooth, bluish-green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes, and have a spurred structure, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum flerovii is primarily native to Central European Russia.</p>
<p>It is found in the forest-steppe and steppe zones of the region. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in meadows. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Central European Russia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum flerovii was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and garden plantings.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal, often carried by wind or water. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other non-native plant species.</p>
