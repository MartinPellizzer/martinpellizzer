                        <h1>Acanthophyllum squarrosum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum squarrosum, commonly known as the silky acanthophyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle floral display. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum squarrosum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>
