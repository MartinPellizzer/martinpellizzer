<p>Anisotes nyassae, commonly known as the African water fern, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has a feathery, floating frond structure that aids in photosynthesis and oxygenation of the water. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Anisotes nyassae plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
