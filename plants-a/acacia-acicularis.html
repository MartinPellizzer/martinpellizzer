                        <h1>Acacia acicularis</h1>
<p>Acacia acicularis, commonly known as the needle acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like phyllodes that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, elongated pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Acacia acicularis is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia acicularis is primarily native to Australia, specifically the southeastern regions of the country.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as South Australia, Victoria, and parts of New South Wales. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dunes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a characteristic plant of the Australian desert and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acacia acicularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia acicularis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was also introduced for soil stabilization and as a potential source of timber and forage. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, management efforts are required to control its impact on native biodiversity.</p>
