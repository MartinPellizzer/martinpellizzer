                <h1>Acalypha crotonoides</h1>
<p>Acalypha crotonoides, commonly known as redleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and vibrant red or orange foliage, which becomes more intense during the dry season. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha crotonoides has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green with a slight reddish tinge, ranging in size from 3 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, cylindrical, and smooth with a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming from spring to summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed, three-chambered capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha crotonoides is a species native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, likely due to human introduction. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its habitat faces threats from deforestation and land-use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha crotonoides is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, colorful foliage that adds visual interest to gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the desired variegation. This plant thrives in a warm, humid climate and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few weeks during the growing season promotes lush growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's overall health.</p>
