                <h1>Achillea gigantea</h1>
<p>Achillea gigantea, commonly known as giant yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a variety of medicinal compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, which have been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in herbal teas.</p>
<p>Achillea gigantea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea gigantea has leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a smooth, grayish-green bark, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea gigantea is a tall perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Tibet.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited and fragmented, with populations found in remote alpine areas. It thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, typically in open habitats such as grasslands and meadows. This species is commonly found at altitudes between 2,500 and 5,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Achillea gigantea is considered endangered, and its conservation status is a growing concern for botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea gigantea is a hardy perennial known for its showy, flat-topped flower clusters and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in mid to late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea gigantea is a tall flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering shelter and habitat in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby flora by improving soil conditions. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea gigantea is a tall, flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. It also holds cultural significance, symbolizing courage and remembrance in various historical contexts. In industrial and economic terms, it contributes to the horticultural industry by providing aesthetic value and supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems further highlights its importance in maintaining biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea gigantea has several popular cultivars such as 'Hedgerow', 'Tidal Wave', and 'The Pearl', which are valued for their striking flower colors and robust growth.</p>
<p>These cultivars often exhibit improved hardiness and longer bloom periods compared to the species plant. Hybrids of Achillea gigantea are less common due to its strong genetic traits, but some crossbreeding occurs with other Achillea species to enhance ornamental features. Horticulturally, Achillea gigantea is important for its ability to thrive in various garden conditions, making it a versatile choice for landscaping.</p>
<p>Its use in gardens contributes to biodiversity and the aesthetic appeal of cultivated landscapes.</p>
