                <h1>Achillea gigantea</h1>
<p>Achillea gigantea, commonly known as giant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces flat, clustered flower heads composed of small white or pale yellow florets, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided, aromatic, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Giant yarrow thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and adaptable plant in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea gigantea has large, gray-green, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a silvery-blue hue due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and often reddish-brown in color, growing in a branching pattern with a somewhat woody texture. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea gigantea is a tall, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections around the world, though it is not widely naturalized in the wild. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, Achillea gigantea is considered to be of conservation concern in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea gigantea is a tall, showy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in the fall. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in the summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry spells. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its beauty and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
