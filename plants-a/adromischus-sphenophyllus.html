                <h1>Adromischus sphenophyllus</h1>
<p>Adromischus sphenophyllus, commonly known as the "Cushion Stonecrop," is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tinge, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus sphenophyllus has succulent, fleshy leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern, and typically measure around 2â€“4 cm in length, with a bluish-green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the dense foliage. It produces small, star-shaped flowers that are pale yellow to cream in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to store water and nutrients in its native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus sphenophyllus is primarily native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the region's arid and semi-arid areas, particularly in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This succulent plant thrives in environments with minimal rainfall and high sunlight exposure. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the Cape Provinces, where it grows as a small, compact shrub.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus sphenophyllus was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, succulent leaves that can range from green to reddish hues. It is relatively low maintenance and drought tolerant, which contributes to its widespread use in landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
