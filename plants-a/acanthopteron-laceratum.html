                        <h1>Acanthopteron laceratum</h1>
<p>Acanthopteron laceratum, commonly known as the roughleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, sandpapery texture, and often have a bluish-gray hue. Its flowers are small and typically range in color from yellow to orange, appearing in dense, spherical clusters.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopteron laceratum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species is commonly found in areas with high moisture levels and acidic soils. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopteron laceratum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant has spread beyond its original range due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts on local biodiversity.</p>
