                <h1>Achyropappus queretarensis</h1>
<p>Achyropappus queretarensis, commonly known as the Mexican fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, showcasing its resilience in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropappus queretarensis has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, branching, and covered with a smooth, light green bark. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures that bloom in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropappus queretarensis is primarily native to the northeastern regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with rocky or limestone habitats. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropappus queretarensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and arid conditions, often found in regions with low precipitation.</p>
<p>It is typically associated with rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability. This plant is commonly found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has been reported in several states including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
