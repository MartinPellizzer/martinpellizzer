<p>Avena sativa subsp.</p>
<p>diffusa, commonly known as slender oat, is a lesser-known subspecies of the common oat. It is characterized by its shorter stature and more delicate foliage compared to typical oat varieties.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>While not as widely cultivated as other oat subspecies, it is valued for its potential in forage and ecological restoration.</p>
