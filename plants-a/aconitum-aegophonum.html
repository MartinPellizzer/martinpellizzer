                    <h1>Aconitum aegophonum</h1>
<p>Aconitum aegophonum, commonly known as the Alpineaconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated in gardens.</p>
