                <h1>Acer wilsonii var. obtusum</h1>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. obtusum, commonly known as the Wilson maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. obtusum has elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a single trunk form. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind; the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. obtusum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, largely due to habitat fragmentation and human activity. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. The species is considered endangered due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique and vulnerable plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. obtusum is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with a focus on establishing strong roots in the early years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate insecticides.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. obtusum is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity in the region. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed hardwood forests, enhancing overall ecosystem stability. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, particularly on slopes and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the forest by improving soil structure and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. obtusum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter-tasting leaves and fruits.</p>
<p>However, it has potential in traditional medicine for its possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though scientific research is still limited. In industrial applications, its wood may be used for small-scale woodworking or as a source of fiber, though it is not widely harvested for economic purposes. Culturally, it is appreciated in botany and horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly its unique foliage.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the biodiversity of its native regions and the importance of conserving rare plant species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii var. obtusum has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in the development of various hybrids, such as Acer x carpinifolium, which combines the ornamental qualities of different maple species. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced hardiness and improved leaf coloration, making them more adaptable to diverse garden conditions. The horticultural importance of Acer wilsonii var. obtusum lies in its role as a genetic contributor to the creation of ornamental maples with unique foliage and structural characteristics.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes to the diversity of landscape plants, particularly in regions with cooler climates.</p>
