                    <h1>Aragallus pinetorum var. veganus</h1>
<p>Aragallus pinetorum var. veganus, commonly known as the Vegan Pineapple Plant, is a rare variant of the Aragallus pinetorum species native to the temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, succulent leaves that are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, moist habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies for their purported calming properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
