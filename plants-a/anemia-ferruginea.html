                    <h1>Anemia ferruginea</h1>
<p>Anemia ferruginea, commonly known as rusty rust or *Puccinia ferruginea*, is a parasitic fungal plant disease that affects grasses.</p>
<p>It is characterized by the formation of reddish-brown pustules on the leaves, which contain the fungus's spores. The disease is caused by the rust fungus *Puccinia ferruginea*, which overwinters as teliospores on infected plant debris. It spreads through wind-borne spores and can cause significant damage to crops like wheat and barley.</p>
<p>The botanical study of this disease involves understanding its life cycle, host range, and methods of control.</p>
