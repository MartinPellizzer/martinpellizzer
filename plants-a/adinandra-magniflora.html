                <h1>Adinandra magniflora</h1>
<p>Adinandra magniflora, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant has a robust trunk with smooth, greyish bark and can grow up to 30 meters tall. Its leaves are pinnate, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Adinandra magniflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra magniflora has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern with a tendency to branch near the base. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white or pale yellow petals and numerous stamens; they bloom during the dry season and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra magniflora is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, which is part of the Indo-Malesian biodiversity hotspot. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense canopy of lowland and hill forests. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Borneo, where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local flora and is often associated with other endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra magniflora was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and lowland areas. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has been introduced as a landscape plant in many countries where it can establish itself in the wild.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
