                <h1>Aciotis ferreirana</h1>
<p>Aciotis ferreirana, commonly known as the Brazilian sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular florets that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Aciotis ferreirana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis ferreirana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, grayish bark, exhibiting a branching growth pattern as it matures. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring tubular corollas with yellow-orange petals and a blue-violet throat, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis ferreirana is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Amapá, Pará, and northern Amazonas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with forest understory and wetlands in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the northern part of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis ferreirana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as a result of human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, pastures, and agricultural fields. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils have contributed to its spread across different regions. It has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is also studied for its ecological and potential medicinal properties.</p>
