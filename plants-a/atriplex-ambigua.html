<p>Atriplex ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for coastal and saline soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex ambigua plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
