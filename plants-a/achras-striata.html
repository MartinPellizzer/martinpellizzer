                <h1>Achras striata</h1>
<p>Achras striata, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ability to provide shade and support for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras striata has palmate leaves that are broad, lobed, and usually green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny, spherical berry that disperses its seeds by animals eating the fruit and later excreting the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras striata is primarily native to the Caribbean Islands, including the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Costa Rica and Panama. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is commonly seen in mangrove ecosystems and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some regions of South America, particularly northern Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras striata was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique, spiny leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in regions where it is not native.</p>
