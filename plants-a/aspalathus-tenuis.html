                    <h1>Aspalathus tenuis</h1>
<p>Aspalathus tenuis, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, bean-like pods containing its seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Aspalathus tenuis is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), but it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use.</p>
