                <h1>Adyseton sibiricum</h1>
<p>Adyseton sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of around 10-20 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are slender and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base.</p>
<p>Adyseton sibiricum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton sibiricum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a sprawling or semi-woody shrub form. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, allowing the plant to anchor itself and access deep water sources.</p>
