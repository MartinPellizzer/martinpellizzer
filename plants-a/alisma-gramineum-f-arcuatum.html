                    <h1>Alisma gramineum f. arcuatum</h1>
<p>Alisma gramineum f. arcuatum, commonly known as the curved arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arcuate (curved) leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
