                    <h1>Astragalus distinens</h1>
<p>Astragalus distinens, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>The seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range.</p>
