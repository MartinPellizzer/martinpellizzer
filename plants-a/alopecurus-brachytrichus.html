The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Alopecurus brachytrichus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
