                <h1>Adenoncos uniflora</h1>
<p>Adenoncos uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower adenoncos, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in parts of Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its unique, solitary pink or purple flower that blooms during the cooler months. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Adenoncos uniflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos uniflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly woody texture, and a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are solitary, tubular in structure, with a striking violet-blue color, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos uniflora is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of Indonesia. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically in the undergrowth of dense forest areas. It is known for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution is becoming increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos uniflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed areas and competes with native species for resources.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about biodiversity loss in local habitats.</p>
