<p>Alyssum tortuosum subsp.</p>
<p>eximium, commonly known as the slender alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer.</p>
