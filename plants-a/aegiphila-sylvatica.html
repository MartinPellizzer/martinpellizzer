                <h1>Aegiphila sylvatica</h1>
<p>Aegiphila sylvatica, commonly known as the Brazilian pennyroyal, is a perennial shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila sylvatica has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stems, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, greyish bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white, with five petals and a tubular corolla, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native arid or semi-arid habitats.</p>
