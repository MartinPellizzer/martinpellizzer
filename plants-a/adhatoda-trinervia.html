<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda trinervia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 4-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a pale green to brownish bark that is rough and fissured. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five petals, usually pink or red in color, and bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects.
