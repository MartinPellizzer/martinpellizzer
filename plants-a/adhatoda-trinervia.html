                <h1>Adhatoda trinervia</h1>
<p>Adhatoda trinervia, commonly known as Indian banyan, is a flowering plant native to tropical Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive aerial roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda trinervia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale brown to greyish bark that peels off in thin strips. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with tubular corolla and five lobes, typically appearing in white or pale blue, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda trinervia is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in regions with similar climatic conditions, such as southern China and the Caribbean. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forests, along riverbanks, and in open grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Adhatoda trinervia is considered to be of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda trinervia is a fast-growing, aromatic shrub native to tropical regions, commonly cultivated for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings showing the highest success rate. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within 6â€“12 months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases like leaf spot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda trinervia is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy blue or purple flowers, aiding in the reproduction of the plant and supporting local pollinator populations. The plant also acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other medicinal and ornamental plants to enhance their growth and resilience. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adhatoda trinervia plays a role in improving soil health by fixing nitrogen, which enriches the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adhatoda trinervia is a versatile plant known for its various uses across different domains.</p>
