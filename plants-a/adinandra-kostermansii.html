                <h1>Adinandra kostermansii</h1>
<p>Adinandra kostermansii, commonly known as the Koster's adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is a small to medium-sized shrub, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds through wind or animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra kostermansii has elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size and a slightly pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that has a somewhat woody texture. Its small, clustered white flowers have four petals and appear in the rainy season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in humid, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra kostermansii is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Southeast Asian region. The plant thrives in the humid and warm climate typical of the Borneo rainforest ecosystem. It is often encountered in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is limited to this specific geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra kostermansii was mainly introduced to disturbed and secondary forest areas in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to establish quickly.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
