<p>Adiantum tetraphyllum var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, upright fiddleheads in early spring.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
