                <h1>Aegilops umbellulata</h1>
<p>Aegilops umbellulata, commonly known as the wheatgrass or slender wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and marginal habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Aegilops umbellulata is also valued for its potential in forage and as a source of genetic material for wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops umbellulata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping manner. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with white to pale green flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a glume, containing small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hair-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil surface.</p>
