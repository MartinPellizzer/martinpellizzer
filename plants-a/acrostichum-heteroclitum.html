                <h1>Acrostichum heteroclitum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum heteroclitum, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along coastal areas and in humid forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of pinnae and pinnules.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heteroclitum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green on the upper surface, and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a spreading pattern. It produces inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This fern is adapted to wet, tropical environments and thrives in shaded, moist areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heteroclitum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland environments, particularly in mangrove swamps and coastal areas. This plant is commonly found in brackish water habitats, where it plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines. It is also occasionally reported in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of moist, saline soils and tidal influences.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heteroclitum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats, often as a result of human activity or natural disturbances.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions, marshes, and along riverbanks where it can thrive in moist to wet conditions. This plant is typically spread through rhizomes and seeds, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions and is often treated as a native or naturalized species.</p>
