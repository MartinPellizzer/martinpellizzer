                <h1>Acnistus aggregatus</h1>
<p>Acnistus aggregatus, commonly known as the stinkbush or stinking beggar's-tick, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fruiting structures that resemble small, spiny balls. Its roots and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Acnistus aggregatus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus aggregatus has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, with a smooth texture and a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a trailing or climbing manner. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's creeping growth habit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus aggregatus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is commonly seen in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas within Africa and southern Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus aggregatus was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there accidentally through human activities, such as transportation of contaminated soil or plant material. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and forest edges, which allows it to spread rapidly. Its aggressive growth and ability to form dense stands can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a threat to local ecosystems and is often targeted for control.</p>
