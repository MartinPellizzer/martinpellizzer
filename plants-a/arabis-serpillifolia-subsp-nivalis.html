<p>Arabis serpillifolia subsp.</p>
<p>nivalis, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh mountain conditions and is often found in meadows and scree slopes.</p>
