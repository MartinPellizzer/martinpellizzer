                <h1>Achillea wolffii</h1>
<p>Achillea wolffii, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces feathery, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Achillea wolffii thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea wolffii has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-gray color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a slightly rough texture, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is usually solitary. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea wolffii is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky, and arid environments, often growing in mountainous areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Morocco.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into regions with a climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea wolffii was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the western United States. The plant thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its invasive potential has raised concerns in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat in all regions where it has been introduced.</p>
