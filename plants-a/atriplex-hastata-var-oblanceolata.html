                    <h1>Atriplex hastata var. oblanceolata</h1>
<p>Atriplex hastata var. oblanceolata, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oblanceolate, meaning they are elongated with a broad base and tapering tip.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
