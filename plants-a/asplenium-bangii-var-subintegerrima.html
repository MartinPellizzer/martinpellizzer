                    <h1>Asplenium bangii var. subintegerrima</h1>
<p>Asplenium bangii var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments such as botanical gardens.</p>
