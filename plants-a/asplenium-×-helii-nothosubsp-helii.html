<p>Asplenium × helii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>helii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium scolopendrium*. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>While it does not produce viable spores, it is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
