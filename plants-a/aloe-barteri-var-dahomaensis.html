                    <h1>Aloe barteri var. dahomaensis</h1>
<p>Aloe barteri var. dahomaensis, commonly known as the Dahoma aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
