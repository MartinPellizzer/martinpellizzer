                <h1>Actinea cooperi</h1>
<p>Actinea cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, white to pale pink, petal-like blooms that surround a cluster of yellow stamens. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It typically grows in moist, woodland environments and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Actinea cooperi is valued for its early spring bloom and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea cooperi has distinctive palmate leaves that are typically 3-5 lobed, with a bright green color and a smooth texture, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish-white petals and a sweet fragrance, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a spherical, red berry that matures in late summer, containing several seeds dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea cooperi is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress swamps. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution has been limited due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea cooperi was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been observed thriving in moist, shaded forest environments. The introduction of this plant has led to concerns about its potential impact on native flora. It is often found growing along streams and in areas with rich organic soil.</p>
<p>Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to form dense colonies and tolerate varying light conditions.</p>
