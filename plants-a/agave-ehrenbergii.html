<p>Agave ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Ehrenberg's agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with white teeth along the edges, and they store water to help the plant survive in dry conditions. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
