<p>Acer italum var. aetnense, commonly known as the Aetna maple, is a variant of the Italian maple native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its role in local ecosystems and its resilience to high-altitude conditions.</p>
