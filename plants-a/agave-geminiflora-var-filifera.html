<p>Agave geminiflora var. filifera, commonly known as the threadleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves with white marginal teeth, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers, typically blooming after several decades. It is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
