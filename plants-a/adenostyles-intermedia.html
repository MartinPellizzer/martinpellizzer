                <h1>Adenostyles intermedia</h1>
<p>Adenostyles intermedia, commonly known as the slender broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenostyles intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles intermedia has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and grows in a clump-like pattern, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring pink to red petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles intermedia is primarily native to Switzerland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and grassy slopes at higher elevations. It is an important component of the local alpine flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific climatic and geological conditions of the Swiss alpine environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles intermedia was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant has been spread through human activities such as gardening and landscaping. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
