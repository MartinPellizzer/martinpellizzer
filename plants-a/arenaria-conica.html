                    <h1>Arenaria conica</h1>
<p>Arenaria conica, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria conica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
