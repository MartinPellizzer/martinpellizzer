                    <h1>Aconitum wallichianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum wallichianum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it both dangerous and valuable in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though caution is necessary due to its harmful properties.</p>
