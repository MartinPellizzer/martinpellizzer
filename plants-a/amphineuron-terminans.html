                    <h1>Amphineuron terminans</h1>
<p>Amphineuron terminans, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, saline water, adapting to its harsh environment through specialized root systems. Its leaves are thin and translucent, allowing for efficient light absorption.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a minor role in its ecosystem, primarily as a predator of small aquatic organisms.</p>
