                    <h1>Asclepias himanthophylla</h1>
<p>Asclepias himanthophylla, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, especially the monarch butterfly, which relies on it as a host plant for its larvae.</p>
<p>Asclepias himanthophylla plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
