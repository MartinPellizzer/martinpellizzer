<p>Adenandra intermedia, commonly known as the Natal hibiscus, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adenandra intermedia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra intermedia has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>

<p>It is commonly found in coastal forests and fynbos vegetation types. This plant thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in shaded areas under indigenous trees.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to these specific regions within South Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
