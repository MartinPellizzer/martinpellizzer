<p>Asclepias gigantea, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy orange and red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both the larvae and adult insects.</p>
<p>Additionally, its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for its ecological role.</p>
