                        <h1>Acalypha chiapensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapan beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant produces small, berry-like structures that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acalypha chiapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha chiapensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and subtropical species with a wide range of morphological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and often contains latex-producing species. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their often hairy leaves and showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha chiapensis, a specific plant species native to Central America, known for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chiapensis is primarily native to Mexico Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas and Tabasco. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in humid lowland areas. The plant is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chiapensis was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates.</p>
<p>It has been found in several states including Florida, Texas, and California. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
