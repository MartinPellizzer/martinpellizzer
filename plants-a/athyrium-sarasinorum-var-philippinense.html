                    <h1>Athyrium sarasinorum var. philippinense</h1>
<p>Athyrium sarasinorum var. philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine sword fern, is a fern species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
