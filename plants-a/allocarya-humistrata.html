<p>Allocarya humistrata, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of marshes. Allocarya humistrata has a distinctive root system that helps it anchor in waterlogged conditions, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like.</p>
