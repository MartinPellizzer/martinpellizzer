<p>Asperula ciliaris, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a silvery-gray coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Asperula ciliaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
