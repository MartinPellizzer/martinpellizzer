                <h1>Aechmea viridis</h1>
<p>Aechmea viridis, commonly known as the green bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy layer that helps reduce water loss. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range from yellow to red.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea viridis has leaves that are strap-like, narrow, and slightly curved, arranged in a rosette formation, with a bright green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick base that supports the rosette of leaves. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a colorful bract, and typically bloom in late spring to early summer, pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
