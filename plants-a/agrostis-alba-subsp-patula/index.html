                            <h1>Agrostis Alba Subsp. Patula</h1>
<p>White bentgrass, scientifically known as Agrostis alba subsp. patula, is a low-growing grass species commonly found in moist, temperate environments. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and turfgrass applications. This subspecies is particularly adapted to wetland conditions, often thriving in areas with consistent moisture. Its ability to form dense mats helps prevent soil erosion and supports a variety of wildlife. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
