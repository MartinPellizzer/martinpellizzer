                <h1>Acrostichum glabratum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth swamp fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Acrostichum glabratum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glabratum has leaves that are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in terminal panicles during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glabratum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, mangrove forests, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with coastal and brackish environments. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and some regions of southern North America.</p>
<p>Acrostichum glabratum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glabratum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This plant is often associated with coastal environments and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
