<p>[WRONG START] Achillea × kas Kazakhstanica, commonly known as the Kazakhstan yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's name honors the botanist Achillea, with the specific epithet referring to its geographical origin.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × kasakhstanica has leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are compound umbels of small white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant to stabilize in its environment.</p>
