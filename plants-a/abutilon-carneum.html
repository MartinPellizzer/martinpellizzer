                        <h1>Abutilon carneum</h1>
<p>Abutilon carneum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage.</p>
<p>Abutilon carneum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon carneum is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Angola.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas with moderate to high salinity. This plant is commonly found in dune environments and coastal grasslands, where it adapts well to salty air and wind exposure. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is also occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens in other parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon carneum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its soft, velvety leaves and showy flowers. Despite its ornamental value, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to spread rapidly and disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
