<p>It is characterized by its woody shrub form and features small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The leaves are usually opposite, elliptical in shape, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly rough texture. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta var. macrobracteata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a rough, hairy texture, and has a brownish color, growing in a shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta var. macrobracteata is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Asia, primarily found in Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within these regions, where it grows in humid, shaded forest understories. This species thrives in tropical rainforests with high humidity and moderate temperatures, typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural range, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta var. macrobracteata is a resilient shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
