                    <h1>Antennaria hibernica</h1>
<p>Antennaria hibernica, commonly known as the winter sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy, evergreen leaves that remain throughout the winter. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Antennaria hibernica is well adapted to cold climates and can survive freezing temperatures due to its frost-resistant foliage.</p>
