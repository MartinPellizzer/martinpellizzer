                    <h1>Agave pruinosa</h1>
<p>Agave pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called pruinose, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, yellow-green flowers on tall, branched stalks during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Agave pruinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
