<p>Asplenium paucivenosum subsp.</p>
<p>birii, commonly known as the Birii spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or on the forest floor. Its fronds are usually short and have a single vein, which is a key identifying feature.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, shaded habitats.</p>
