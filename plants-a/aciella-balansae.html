                <h1>Aciella balansae</h1>
<p>Aciella balansae, commonly known as the Balansae aciella, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aciella balansae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciella balansae has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy surface and a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella balansae is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in parts of Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, typically at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 meters. This species is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of the Andes and thrives in well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this geographic range.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella balansae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. It has since spread to parts of Washington and northern California.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be due to horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
