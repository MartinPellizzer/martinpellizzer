<p>Alisma batrachiocarpum, commonly known as the frog's bean or water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, ponds, and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in wet environments.</p>
<p>Alisma batrachiocarpum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
