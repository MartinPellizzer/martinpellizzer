                <h1>Acosta laureotica</h1>
<p>Acosta laureotica, commonly known as the golden star tree, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling stars. The plant has palmate leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Acosta laureotica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of Andean flora and plant adaptation to high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta laureotica has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta laureotica is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests and rocky mountainous terrain. It is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Andes, including strong winds and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta laureotica was mainly introduced to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal grasslands and sandy soils. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via shipping or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. It has since become naturalized in several regions, thriving in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered a common weed in some areas.</p>
