                <h1>Acoridium auritum</h1>
<p>Acoridium auritum, commonly known as the golden ear orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble ears, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface.</p>
<p>Acoridium auritum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium auritum has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, white flowers with three petals and three sepals, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds through mechanical means when they dry and split open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium auritum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant typically grows in shaded undergrowth, often near streams or in humid environments. It is a herbaceous plant with distinctive, ear-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is closely tied to the tropical and subtropical climates of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium auritum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies or in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where humidity is consistently high. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as abandoned fields or along forest edges. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
