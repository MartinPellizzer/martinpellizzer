                <h1>Aciotis viscida</h1>
<p>Aciotis viscida, commonly known as sticky aciotis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a unique texture. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its small yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscida has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough bark that is usually brown to gray in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscida is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The species is known for its adaptability to humid climates and is often found in lowland regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its preference for warm, humid habitats across South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscida was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and urban settings. The plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a major threat to native ecosystems.</p>
