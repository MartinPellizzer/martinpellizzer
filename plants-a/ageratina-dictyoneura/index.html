<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Ageratina dictyoneura, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is recognized for its fluffy, blue-gray flower clusters that resemble a misty haze, giving it its common name. This perennial plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance contrasts with its resilience, making it a popular choice for wet garden landscapes. With its unique visual appeal and ecological benefits, the Blue mistflower plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and enhancing biodiversity.</p>
