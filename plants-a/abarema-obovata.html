                        <h1>Abarema obovata</h1>
<p>Abarema obovata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *Pau-rosa*, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its ornamental, elongated, obovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its woody stems and hard, dark wood make it valuable in traditional woodworking.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in several regions.</p>
