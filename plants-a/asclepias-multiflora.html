                    <h1>Asclepias multiflora</h1>
<p>Asclepias multiflora, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the stems are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>Asclepias multiflora plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and is a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
