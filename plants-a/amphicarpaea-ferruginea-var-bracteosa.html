                    <h1>Amphicarpaea ferruginea var. bracteosa</h1>
<p>Amphicarpaea ferruginea var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteosa ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces both fertile and sterile flowers, a trait known as amphicarpous, which allows it to reproduce through two different mechanisms. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist to wet soils in woodland or prairie habitats.</p>
