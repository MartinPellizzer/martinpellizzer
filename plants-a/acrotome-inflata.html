                <h1>Acrotome inflata</h1>
<p>Acrotome inflata, commonly known as the inflated acrotome, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its unique, inflated seed pods that resemble small balloons, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. Its flowers are typically showy, with five petals and prominent stamens, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acrotome inflata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotome inflata has leaves that are broad and ovate in shape, with a waxy green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome inflata is primarily native to Angola, Botswana, Cape Provinces, Free State, Lesotho, Namibia, Northern Provinces, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open grasslands and shrublands. Acrotome inflata is well adapted to the dry climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to southern Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome inflata was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread to other tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in several areas where it has been introduced.</p>
