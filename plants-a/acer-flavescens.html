                <h1>Acer flavescens</h1>
<p>Acer flavescens, commonly known as the yellow maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn a striking yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically yellow-green in color, turning yellow or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in parts of Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and Asia, though it is not widely cultivated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This species typically grows at elevations between 300 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native range and habitat specificity, Acer flavescens is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens is a small, deciduous tree known for its vibrant yellow foliage, commonly cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to germinate. The growth cycle of Acer flavescens involves rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer flavescens contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering habitat for diverse organisms.</p>
