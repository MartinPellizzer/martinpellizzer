                <h1>Acer flavescens</h1>
<p>Acer flavescens, commonly known as the yellow maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, giving it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a broad, spreading canopy. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually 5-10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a serrated edge, displaying a yellow-green color in spring that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips, and the growth pattern is typically upright with a rounded crown. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with a winged seed, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, with limited cultivation outside of its natural habitat. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within forests or along stream banks. Acer flavescens is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant yellow foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance its growth and soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in spring. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens is a lesser-known maple species that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, sour-tasting fruits.</p>
<p>However, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Its wood, though not widely used industrially, may have local economic value in small-scale crafts or fuel. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in regions where it is native, though specific meanings are not well documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more common maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer flavescens has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking yellow foliage. Hybrids of Acer flavescens are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and color variation. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their unique leaf patterns and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and botanical gardens for their aesthetic appeal.</p>
