                <h1>Acer × creticum var. macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Acer × creticum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with a smooth margin and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>The leaves are a deep green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × creticum var. macrophyllum is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in parts of Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Although originally restricted to its native range, it is now cultivated in various temperate regions worldwide, including North America and parts of Asia. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in forest understories. It is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin and limited natural occurrence, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status that requires careful management to preserve its genetic diversity.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × creticum var. macrophyllum is a hybrid maple known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This species grows best in temperate climates, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
