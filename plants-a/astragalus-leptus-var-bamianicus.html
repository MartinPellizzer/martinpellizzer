The plant produces small, kidney-shaped pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
