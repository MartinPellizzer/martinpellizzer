                    <h1>Allochrusa</h1>
<p>Allochrusa, commonly known as the sand lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alstroemeriaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, where they thrive in arid and coastal environments. Allochrusa species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are often found growing in sandy or rocky soils, and some species are cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Allochrusa species are considered rare or endangered.</p>
