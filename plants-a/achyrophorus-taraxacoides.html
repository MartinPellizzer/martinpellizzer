                <h1>Achyrophorus taraxacoides</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus taraxacoides, commonly known as the yellow starburry, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. It produces small, spiny fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in open, sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus taraxacoides has simple, basal leaves that are spoon-shaped (spatulate) with a waxy surface, arranged in a rosette formation, and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, typically with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark, growing from the base of the rosette. The flowers are yellow, composite-like structures with ray florets and disk florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus taraxacoides is primarily native to the temperate regions of eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. This plant thrives in moist to mesic environments and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. Its distribution extends from the northeastern United States down to the southeastern states.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its composite flower heads.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus taraxacoides was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate moisture levels. This plant is commonly found in roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a widespread invasive species in certain parts of the world.</p>
