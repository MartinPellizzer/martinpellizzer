<p>Acoridium hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in a spike-like cluster, and it produces berries that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Acoridium hastatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
