                <h1>Acoridium hastatum</h1>
<p>Acoridium hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in a spike-like cluster, and it produces berries that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Acoridium hastatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium hastatum has narrow, elongated leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and typically range from 30 to 60 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, cylindrical texture and a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium hastatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often near streams or in moist, shaded areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is typically associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium hastatum was mainly introduced to specific regions with suitable moist, shaded environments, often as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial to full shade, such as gardens and forest understories. The plant's introduction has been primarily due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation. However, it has shown potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range due to human activity and climate changes.</p>
