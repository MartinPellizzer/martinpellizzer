                <h1>Acrostichum nemorale</h1>
<p>Acrostichum nemorale, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Acrostichum nemorale thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and growth habit make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nemorale has leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows vertically. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nemorale is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This plant is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats due to its ability to colonize open spaces. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of these regions by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of the health and biodiversity of tropical wetlands and forest understories.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nemorale was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions where its native range has been expanded through horticultural practices or accidental dispersal. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments and can establish itself quickly in open areas. Its introduction has led to its presence in various parts of the world, including the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
