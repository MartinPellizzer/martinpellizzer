                <h1>Adonis pilosa</h1>
<p>Adonis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Adonis pilosa is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis pilosa has leaves that are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow, with a single pistil and several stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis pilosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. The plant is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often seen in open woodlands and grasslands. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is also present in some regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis pilosa was mainly introduced to control erosion on disturbed soils due to its rapid growth and dense root system.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open areas such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed ground where it can establish quickly. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it a useful species for land stabilization projects. However, its aggressive growth can lead to displacement of native vegetation if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, it is considered a weed in many regions where it has become naturalized.</p>
