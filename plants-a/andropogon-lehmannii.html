<p>Andropogon lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
