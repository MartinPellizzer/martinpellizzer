<p>Arenaria emarginata subsp.</p>
<p>emarginata, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh maritime environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, often appearing in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local insect populations.</p>
