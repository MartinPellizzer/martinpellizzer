                    <h1>Aristolochia faucimaculata</h1>
<p>Aristolochia faucimaculata, commonly known as the spotted Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain toxic seeds, a trait shared with many species in the Aristolochiaceae family. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by flies, which are attracted by their strong, musty odor.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
