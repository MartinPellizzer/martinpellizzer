<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroptilon picris var. acutifolium has narrow, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroptilon picris var. acutifolium is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and western China.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across similar high-altitude grasslands and steppe areas in these regions. This plant thrives in dry, open environments with well-drained soils, often found in arid and semi-arid climates. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acroptilon picris var. acutifolium is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds sown in early spring and division done in early spring or fall. The plant has a growth cycle that involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring supports growth, while pruning dead foliage in winter maintains its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
