<p>Aechmea nervata, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture and prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea nervata has strap-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a pointed tip and prominent veins.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, sturdy stem that remains hidden beneath the leaves, and its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in the soil.
