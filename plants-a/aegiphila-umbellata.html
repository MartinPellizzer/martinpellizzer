                <h1>Aegiphila umbellata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila umbellata, commonly known as the Umbellate Aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of purple and pink, often arranged in umbel-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, minty aroma.</p>
<p>Aegiphila umbellata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila umbellata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbellate inflorescences, typically white or pale pink, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
