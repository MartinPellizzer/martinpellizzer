<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features finely divided, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage and showy inflorescences make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Achillea arabica is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat various ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea arabica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing from the base to form a flowering stem. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding dark褐色 disk florets, blooming in summer from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea arabica is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa, including countries such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, particularly in regions with similar climatic conditions, though its natural distribution remains largely within its native range. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as deserts, steppes, and along coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Achillea arabica is considered to be of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
