<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads.</p>
<p>Achillea arabica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea arabica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and pale yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
