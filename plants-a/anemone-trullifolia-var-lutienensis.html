<p>Anemone trullifolia var. lutienensis, commonly known as the Lutien anemone, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
