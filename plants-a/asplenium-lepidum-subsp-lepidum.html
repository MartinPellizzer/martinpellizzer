<p>Asplenium lepidum subsp.</p>
<p>lepidum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, moist environments such as crevices or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery, lanceolate leaves that are covered in small, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are found on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
