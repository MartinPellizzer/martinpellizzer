<p>Achillea lanulosa subsp.</p>
<p>megacephala, commonly known as the woolly yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense, grayish-white fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
