                    <h1>Athyriopsis omeiensis</h1>
<p>Athyriopsis omeiensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in damp forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
