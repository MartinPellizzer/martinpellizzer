                    <h1>Alchemilla pseudocartalinica</h1>
<p>Alchemilla pseudocartalinica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladyâ€™s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Alchemilla pseudocartalinica is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
