                    <h1>Actinochloa scorpioides</h1>
<p>Actinochloa scorpioides, commonly known as the swamp grass or arrowhead plant, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a V-shaped pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Actinochloa scorpioides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
