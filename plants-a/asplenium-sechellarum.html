<p>Asplenium sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, typically on limestone substrates. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Asplenium sechellarum is a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native habitat.</p>
