                <h1>Acmella biflora</h1>
<p>Acmella biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>Acmella biflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella biflora has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, green in color, and has a smooth texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are bright yellow, with a unique structure featuring a central disk surrounded by ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella biflora is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats within these areas. The plant thrives in environments with high humidity and abundant sunlight. It is often associated with riparian zones and can be found along riverbanks and in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella biflora was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas have led to its spread in non-native environments. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions because of its competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
