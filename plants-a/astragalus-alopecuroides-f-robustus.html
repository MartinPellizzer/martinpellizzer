                    <h1>Astragalus alopecuroides f. robustus</h1>
<p>Astragalus alopecuroides f. robustus, commonly known as the robust hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
