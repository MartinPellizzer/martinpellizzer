                <h1>Acrophorus falcinellus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus falcinellus, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its pinnate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus falcinellus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus falcinellus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample rainfall. This plant is commonly found in forested landscapes, often growing near streams or in shaded undergrowth. It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus falcinellus was mainly introduced to areas with suitable moist habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed environments such as abandoned fields, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful establishment. It is often found in regions with high rainfall and warm climates.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in invaded areas.</p>
