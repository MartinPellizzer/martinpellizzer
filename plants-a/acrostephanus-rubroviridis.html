                <h1>Acrostephanus rubroviridis</h1>
<p>Acrostephanus rubroviridis, commonly known as the red-and-yellow starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that are typically arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in grassland and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acrostephanus rubroviridis is often found in open areas and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus rubroviridis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular corollas of yellowish-orange color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus rubroviridis is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with savanna and grassland ecosystems. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across parts of the African continent where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus rubroviridis was mainly introduced to areas with suitable Mediterranean climate conditions, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and rocky habitats. This plant has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range, including parts of California and the Mediterranean Basin. Its introduction is often associated with horticultural use due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it has also raised concerns regarding its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
