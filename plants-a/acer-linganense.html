                <h1>Acer linganense</h1>
<p>Acer linganense, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer linganense has palmately compound leaves that are alternate, with 5-9 elliptical leaflets, each 2-5 cm long, arranged in a feather-like pattern, and have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer linganense is a rare and endangered maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to several botanical gardens and conservation areas outside its original habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typically found in dense forests. The plant is commonly found at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Acer linganense is classified as critically endangered, necessitating urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer linganense is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method, though it requires patience due to slow germination. The growth cycle of Acer linganense involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead or diseased branches. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like leaf spot can be managed with proper care and fungicides.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer linganense is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and produces edible berries that are consumed by birds and small mammals. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its dense canopy also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer linganense contributes to nutrient cycling and offers habitat for numerous organisms throughout its life cycle.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer linganense is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may have some traditional uses in local cuisines. In medicinal practices, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its strength and durability, contributing to local economies through timber production.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in various regions, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
