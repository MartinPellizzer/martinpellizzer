                <h1>Acer linganense</h1>
<p>Acer linganense, commonly known as the Lungan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer linganense has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and 3 to 6 cm in width, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a vertical growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer linganense is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically found in parts of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in the mountain forests of central and southern China. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in mixed deciduous or evergreen forests. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer linganense is considered endangered, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer linganense is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer linganense includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer linganense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and produces fruit that is consumed by birds and small mammals. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and enhancing soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer linganense contributes to carbon sequestration and offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer linganense is a deciduous tree native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The wood of Acer linganense is relatively soft and may find limited use in small-scale woodworking or crafts. Culturally, it holds significance in traditional Chinese gardens and is sometimes used as a symbol of resilience and renewal.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity and providing habitat for wildlife also contributes to its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer linganense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aconitifolium' and 'Atrosanguineum', which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth. Hybrids of Acer linganense are often created to enhance traits such as fall color, disease resistance, and adaptability to different climates. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, particularly in shady gardens and as specimen trees.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal and versatility make them important additions to modern landscaping.</p>
