                <h1>Acronia macra</h1>
<p>Acronia macra, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the bracts. Acronia macra thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia macra has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with a few branches. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in early summer, and they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia macra is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with limestone substrates. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a hardy species that has adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia macra was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been documented in various regions, including parts of North America and Europe. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its adaptability, it is not considered invasive in all areas where it has been introduced.</p>
