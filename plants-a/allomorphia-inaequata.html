                    <h1>Allomorphia inaequata</h1>
<p>Allomorphia inaequata, commonly known as the unequal allomorph, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical floral structure, which sets it apart from most other members of the Allomorphiaceae family. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allomorphia inaequata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
