                    <h1>Agave subzonata</h1>
<p>Agave subzonata, commonly known as the zebra agave, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and its distinctive, blue-gray leaves with white to yellowish longitudinal stripes. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of small, white flowers, which appear in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
