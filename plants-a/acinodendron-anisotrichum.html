                <h1>Acinodendron anisotrichum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron anisotrichum, commonly known as the irregular-haired acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with a distinctive irregular venation pattern. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and numerous stamens.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron anisotrichum has alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a pale green to brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron anisotrichum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and is often associated with forest understory vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions, making it a regionally important species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron anisotrichum was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climatic conditions, including warm and humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils, often in disturbed or secondary growth habitats. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely understudied.</p>
