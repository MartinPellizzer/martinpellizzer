                <h1>Aechmea ferruginea</h1>
<p>Aechmea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are broad, leathery, and often have a reddish or rusty hue, giving the plant its common name. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea ferruginea has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a compact rosette, typically reaching lengths of 30 to 50 centimeters, and are a deep green color. The plant has a short, thick stem that is often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, grayish bark. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically in shades of red or orange, and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted to store water.</p>
