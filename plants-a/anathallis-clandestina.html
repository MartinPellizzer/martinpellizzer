                    <h1>Anathallis clandestina</h1>
<p>Anathallis clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of moisture and light.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
