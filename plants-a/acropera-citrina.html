                <h1>Acropera citrina</h1>
<p>Acropera citrina, commonly known as the yellow lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a spike of delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in bogs or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, while its flowers are arranged in a loose spiral along the stem.</p>
<p>Acropera citrina is a perennial herb that plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropera citrina has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a vibrant green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a slightly woody texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera citrina is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with shaded undergrowth in secondary forests. It is also present in parts of Australia, particularly in Queensland.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some islands in the Pacific Ocean as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera citrina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as part of ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and vacant lots, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant is known for its bright yellow flowers, which make it a popular choice for gardeners. However, it has also been identified as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists in Hawaii and other island ecosystems.</p>
