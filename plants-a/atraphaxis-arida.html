<p>Atraphaxis arida, commonly known as desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis arida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
