                    <h1>Aeluropus pungens var. hirtulus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus pungens var. hirtulus, commonly known as hairy marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing minute florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization and erosion control in harsh environments.</p>
