                <h1>Acianthera subrotundifolia</h1>
<p>Acianthera subrotundifolia, commonly known as the small-leafed acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate to subrotund leaves. The plant produces delicate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil and Argentina.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera subrotundifolia has leaves that are subrotundifoliate, meaning they are nearly round with a broad base, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically have a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a branching pattern, while the bark is thin and smooth, ranging in color from light green to pale brown. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a prominent central column, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera subrotundifolia is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. This orchid species typically grows in humid, forested areas with rich soil and high humidity. It is commonly associated with Atlantic Forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded environments and is often seen in undergrowth vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera subrotundifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, making it suitable for undergrowth in forests or along shaded garden borders. This plant is often found in regions with consistent rainfall and mild temperature fluctuations. Its introduction has been documented in parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and some regions of South America.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide.</p>
