                <h1>Acranthera anamallica</h1>
<p>Acranthera anamallica, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets.</p>
<p>Acranthera anamallica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera anamallica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale yellow to white color, blooming during the winter months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in water absorption from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera anamallica is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and possibly Karnataka. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets. It is commonly associated with areas that have a tropical and subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera anamallica was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape province.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the region during the early 20th century. The plant is commonly found in coastal fynbos vegetation, growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and competition with native flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its distribution and minimize its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
