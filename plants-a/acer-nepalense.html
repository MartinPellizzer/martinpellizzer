<p>Acer nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer nepalense has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually 5–10 cm long and 3–6 cm wide, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
