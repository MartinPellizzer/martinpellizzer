                <h1>Adenophyllum glandulosum</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular adenophyllum, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum glandulosum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are generally 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum glandulosum is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in desert or scrubland habitats. It is an important species in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to specific geographic regions within central and southern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum glandulosum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats, where it competes with native vegetation. This invasive species spreads through its seed dispersal mechanism, which includes wind and animal transport. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
