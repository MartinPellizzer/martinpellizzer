                    <h1>Amyema papuana</h1>
<p>Amyema papuana, commonly known as the Papuan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, red berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as桉树 (eucalyptus), through a specialized root system called a haustellum. It derives some of its nutrients from the host but also performs photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine.</p>
