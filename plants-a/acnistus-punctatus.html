                <h1>Acnistus punctatus</h1>
<p>Acnistus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thin, succulent stems covered in small, white, translucent glands. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acnistus punctatus is adapted to moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus punctatus has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, slender, and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light green to brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a greenish-white color, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively through rhizomes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus punctatus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savanna and grassland habitats, often growing in dry to semi-arid environments. This plant is well adapted to the region's climate and soil conditions, thriving in areas with low rainfall. It is typically found in open areas, including along roadsides and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of the African continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus punctatus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system and seed production, making it an invasive species in many regions. It competes with native vegetation, altering local ecosystems and reducing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include manual removal and the use of herbicides in affected areas.</p>
