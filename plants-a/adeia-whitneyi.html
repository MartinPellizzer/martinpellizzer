                <h1>Adeia whitneyi</h1>
<p>Adeia whitneyi, commonly known as the Whitney's adeia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adeia whitneyi is often found in moist, sandy soils near stream banks or in open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeia whitneyi has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeia whitneyi is primarily native to California.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in the southern and central areas. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. It is often associated with coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeia whitneyi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. The plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is believed to be due to accidental dispersal through human activities or natural spread from nearby native populations.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied.</p>
