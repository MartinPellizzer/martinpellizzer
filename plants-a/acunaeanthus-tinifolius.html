                    <h1>Acunaeanthus tinifolius</h1>
<p>Acunaeanthus tinifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on specific host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is native to certain regions of South America and is often found in humid, forested environments.</p>
