                <h1>Acunaeanthus tinifolius</h1>
<p>Acunaeanthus tinifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on specific host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is native to certain regions of South America and is often found in humid, forested environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acunaeanthus tinifolius has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that exhibits a twisting growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acunaeanthus tinifolius is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in humid lowland areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested habitats. The plant is known for its unique foliage and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Cuba.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acunaeanthus tinifolius was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight exposure. This plant has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a popular ornamental species in horticulture.</p>
<p>However, it has also been noted as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
