<p>Anthemis triumfetti subsp.</p>
<p>decumbens, commonly known as the creeping tansy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a distinctive yellowish or whitish underside, and it produces small, yellowish-green composite flowers.</p>
