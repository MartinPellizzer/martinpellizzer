                <h1>Acmella mutisii</h1>
<p>Acmella mutisii, commonly known as the yellow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow petals and small, spiny seed heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and shrublands. Its flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella mutisii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and have a distinctive cup-like structure, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella mutisii is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and limited cultivation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within humid lowland forests. Acmella mutisii is typically found at altitudes between 200 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The species is considered endangered due to deforestation and habitat degradation, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella mutisii is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its vibrant orange and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic traits. The growth cycle of Acmella mutisii involves a dormant phase during winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, but it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are beneficial, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella mutisii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops through mutualistic relationships. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and improving soil structure.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acmella mutisii contributes to biodiversity by supporting a complex web of ecological interactions in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella mutisii is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its unique yellow flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in folk medicine to treat skin conditions and as an anti-inflammatory remedy. The plant also holds cultural significance in some indigenous communities, where it is used in rituals and ceremonies. While it is not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, its extracts are sometimes used in natural skincare products.</p>
<p>Due to its limited commercial use, its economic impact remains modest compared to other plant species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acmella mutisii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Lime Star' and 'Orange Star', known for their vibrant, long-lasting flower colors. Hybrids of Acmella mutisii are often developed to enhance flower size, color intensity, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance as they are widely used in garden landscapes and floral arrangements.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in various climates makes them a desirable choice for both amateur and professional gardeners.</p>
