                <h1>Adenotrias phrygia</h1>
<p>Adenotrias phrygia, commonly known as the Phrygian adenotris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces a distinctive scent that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Adenotrias phrygia is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenotrias phrygia has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenotrias phrygia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found along cliffs and in dry, sunny environments. This plant is commonly associated with limestone soils and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Mediterranean climate. Its native range extends across countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is also found in some parts of the Middle East, where it grows in similar ecological niches.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenotrias phrygia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often found in Mediterranean and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Europe, including Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France. The plant is typically introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
