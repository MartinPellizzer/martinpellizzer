<p>Alchemilla gelida, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage that reflects light and helps it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
<p>Alchemilla gelida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
