                <h1>Acinos alpinus</h1>
<p>Acinos alpinus, commonly known as the alpine everlet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow, hairy, and adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acinos alpinus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus has small, needle-like leaves that are opposite in arrangement, typically less than 1 cm in length, with a grayish-blue color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, branching, and covered with a rough, grayish bark, growing in a low, compact form. Its flowers are simple, daisy-like structures with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky, alpine environments where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southwestern Asia, including the Caucasus and Turkey. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine meadows. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries such as Italy, France, Germany, and Austria.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus was mainly introduced to areas with high elevations and rocky soils, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with low temperatures and limited moisture. This plant is commonly found in alpine and subalpine zones across Europe and parts of Asia. Its introduction is often associated with natural dispersal through wind or animal activity.</p>
<p>It plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
