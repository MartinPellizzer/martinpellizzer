<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>membranacea, commonly known as the coastal brambles or New Zealand thistles, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its prickly, woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces persistent, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in coastal and subantarctic environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range.</p>
