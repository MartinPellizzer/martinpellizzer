                        <h1>Acaena pinnatifida subsp. membranacea</h1>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>membranacea, commonly known as the coastal brambles or New Zealand thistles, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its prickly, woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces persistent, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in coastal and subantarctic environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>membranacea is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes mountain range.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry to moist grasslands, shrublands, and rocky slopes. It is often associated with coastal and inland areas where the climate is relatively cool and arid.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>membranacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas. It has become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
