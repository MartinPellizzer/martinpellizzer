                <h1>Aechmea streptocalycoides</h1>
<p>Aechmea streptocalycoides, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with red bracts and yellow flowers, adding visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea streptocalycoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea streptocalycoides has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and typically dark green with a waxy coating, arranged in a tight spiral at the base.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead forming a compact rosette with a central rosette that may have a fibrous, dark brown bark-like structure. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, with small, white to pale blue petals and a distinctive red calyx, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment.</p>
