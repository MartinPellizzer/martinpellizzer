<p>Abrophyllum microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Abrophyllum microcarpum is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
