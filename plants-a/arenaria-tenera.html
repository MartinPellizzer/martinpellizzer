                    <h1>Arenaria tenera</h1>
<p>Arenaria tenera, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments, such as rocky soils and sandy habitats, due to its succulent leaves that store water. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its compact growth habit helps it resist wind and cold, making it well adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria tenera plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
