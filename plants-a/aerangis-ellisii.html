                    <h1>Aerangis ellisii</h1>
<p>Aerangis ellisii, commonly known as the Ellis's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant pink or purple hues with intricate patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Aerangis ellisii is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts.</p>
