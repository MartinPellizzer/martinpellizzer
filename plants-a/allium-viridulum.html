                    <h1>Allium viridulum</h1>
<p>Allium viridulum, commonly known as garlic chives, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications for their mild garlic flavor. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its bulbs, though less prominent than those of true garlic, are also edible and have a subtle onion-like taste.</p>
<p>Allium viridulum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
