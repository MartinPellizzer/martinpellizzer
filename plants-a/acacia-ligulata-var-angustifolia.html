                    <h1>Acacia ligulata var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia ligulata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm long and have a distinctive, narrow, linear shape. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
