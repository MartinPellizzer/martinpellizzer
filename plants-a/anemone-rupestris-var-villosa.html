                    <h1>Anemone rupestris var. villosa</h1>
<p>Anemone rupestris var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy rock anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with stout, hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs, which provide additional protection against harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky soils across regions like the western United States.</p>
