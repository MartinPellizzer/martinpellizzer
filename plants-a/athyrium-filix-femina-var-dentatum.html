                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. dentatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. dentatum, commonly known as the notched lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often notched or toothed along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
