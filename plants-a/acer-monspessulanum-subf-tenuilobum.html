                <h1>Acer monspessulanum subf. tenuilobum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>tenuilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. It features palmately lobed leaves with a narrow, elongated shape, often with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>tenuilobum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface turning red or orange in autumn; the leaves are alternate in arrangement and range from 5 to 10 cm in length. The stem is slender and often multi-branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in inflorescences, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>tenuilobum is a rare subspecies of maple native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Spain and Portugal. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Sierra de Cazorla and Sierra de Grazalema regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous areas. This subspecies typically occurs at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>tenuilobum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its distinctive foliage and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results.</p>
<p>This plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil with consistent moisture. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy development. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its ornamental appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>tenuilobum is a small, slow-growing tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting other plant growth. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which helps bind the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence can improve habitat structure, offering protection and nesting sites for a variety of animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>tenuilobum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its wood is occasionally valued for fine woodworking due to its durability and fine grain. It has historical medicinal applications, with its bark and leaves used in traditional remedies for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice in horticulture, contributing to its role in landscape design and urban greening. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and aesthetic than industrial, playing a niche but important role in biodiversity and local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>tenuilobum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', which are prized for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habit. It is also frequently used in hybridization with other maple species to create ornamental varieties with enhanced foliage and growth characteristics.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and unique leaf colors, making them highly sought after in horticulture. The subsp. tenuilobum is particularly valued for its ornamental potential in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of maple trees available for cultivation.</p>
