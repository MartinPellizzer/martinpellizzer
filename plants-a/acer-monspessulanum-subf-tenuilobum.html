<p>Acer monspessulanum subf.</p>
<p>tenuilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically narrower and more elongated compared to other maple species.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.</p>
