                <h1>Acrostichum villosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum villosum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near streams. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum villosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum villosum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 30 to 60 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with each seed having a tuft of hair for aid in flight.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along moist, shaded areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum villosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland forests and wetlands. This plant is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and Samoa. It prefers well-drained to slightly acidic soils and is often associated with coastal areas.</p>
<p>Acrostichum villosum plays an important role in the local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum villosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant thrives in coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray. It has been reported in several tropical and subtropical regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasive behavior in certain ecosystems.</p>
