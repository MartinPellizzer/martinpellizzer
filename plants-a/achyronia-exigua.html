                <h1>Achyronia exigua</h1>
<p>Achyronia exigua, commonly known as the small-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when mature.</p>
<p>Achyronia exigua is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia exigua has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia exigua is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in areas with consistently moist soil and full sun to partial shade. It is often associated with coastal and inland wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia exigua was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun. The plant's ability to spread rapidly makes it a potential invasive species in non-native regions. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>Proper identification is crucial to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
