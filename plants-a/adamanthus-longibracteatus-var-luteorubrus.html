                <h1>Adamanthus longibracteatus var. luteorubrus</h1>
<p>Adamanthus longibracteatus var. luteorubrus, commonly known as the red-orange flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range from orange to red, often appearing in late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces woody capsules as fruit. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, seasonal blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus longibracteatus var. luteorubrus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, exhibiting a growth pattern of branching from the base. Its flowers are clustered in panicles, with small, white to pale yellow blooms that appear in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus longibracteatus var. luteorubrus is a rare shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within the state of SÃ£o Paulo. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils, typically found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adamanthus longibracteatus var. luteorubrus is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant red and orange bracts.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term garden planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning of dead or damaged branches in early spring helps maintain its health and appearance. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like sedum or lavender can enhance its growth and create a harmonious garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adamanthus longibracteatus var. luteorubrus is a valuable plant in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. It also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native vegetation. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>This plant plays a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance in its environment.</p>
