                <h1>Acanthospermum humile</h1>
<p>Acanthospermum humile, commonly known as the small spiny grass, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features wiry, often spiny stems that are typically less than 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are linear, narrow, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acanthospermum humile is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthospermum humile has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that has a slightly prickly texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a slender, cylindrical capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthospermum humile is a flowering plant native to the Americas, particularly found in parts of South America, including Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to some regions of the United States, especially in Texas and Florida, as well as parts of Australia. This species thrives in disturbed environments such as roadsides, pastures, and open woodlands. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Acanthospermum humile is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not at immediate risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthospermum humile is a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant commonly grown in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acanthospermum humile is typically seasonal, with active growth during the warmer months and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Fertilization should be light and applied sparingly, while pruning is recommended to encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with organic insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other drought-tolerant species like agave or yucca can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthospermum humile is a low-growing plant that provides food and shelter for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native species to enhance biodiversity. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting a wide range of wildlife.</p>
