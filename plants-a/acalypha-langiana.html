                        <h1>Acalypha langiana</h1>
<p>Acalypha langiana, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Acalypha langiana is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and ability to attract birds and insects.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha langiana belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of vascular plants that include ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and temperate species with varied morphological features. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and often contains latex-producing species. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupplant," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha langiana, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, distinguished by its unique morphological traits and ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha langiana is primarily native to Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This shrub is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans a wide range across Central America, particularly in Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha langiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there primarily as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred during the 19th and early 20th centuries as part of broader efforts to introduce exotic plants for landscaping and horticultural purposes. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread highlights the ecological risks associated with introducing non-native species to new environments.</p>
