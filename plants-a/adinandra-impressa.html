                <h1>Adinandra impressa</h1>
<p>Adinandra impressa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Adinandra impressa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a valuable species for coastal stabilization and ecological restoration.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra impressa has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a waxy appearance.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin flakes as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are arranged in terminal clusters, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and helping the plant thrive in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra impressa is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and hill forests of this region. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall. It is commonly seen in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Borneo's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra impressa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is an evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. The plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It has since become naturalized in certain areas of the country.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk.</p>
