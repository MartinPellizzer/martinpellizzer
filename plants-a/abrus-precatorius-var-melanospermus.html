<p>Abrus precatorius var. melanospermus, commonly known as the dark-seeded jequirity, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods containing dark, glossy seeds that are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of toxic compounds. Its seeds contain abrin, a potent cytotoxic protein, making it highly dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in various cultural practices.</p>
