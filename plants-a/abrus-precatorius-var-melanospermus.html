<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and striking, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds that are black in color. The seeds are toxic due to the presence of abrin, a potent lectin, and are used in traditional medicine and as a natural poison.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing vine with tendrils. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with five pink to red petals, and they bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flat, bean-like pod that turns from green to brown, containing seeds with a distinctive dark red aril, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the aril.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
