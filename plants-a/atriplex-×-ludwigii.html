<p>Atriplex × ludwigii, commonly known as the saltbush hybrid, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Atriplex confertifolia and Atriplex hymonocarpa. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain water in dry environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Atriplex × ludwigii is often found in saline soils and is well-suited for revegetation projects in disturbed landscapes.</p>
