                <h1>Acmena dispansa</h1>
<p>Acmena dispansa, commonly known as the red-flowered acmena, is a species of flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal and subtropical regions. The plant features glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its most striking characteristic is its showy, red or pinkish-red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Acmena dispansa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena dispansa has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin and a slightly tapered tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena dispansa is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as New South Wales, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rainforests, moist sclerophyll forests, and along streamlines. This plant is commonly found in subtropical and tropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. It is well adapted to the humid and temperate conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Acmena dispensa is an important component of the local flora and is often used in horticulture due to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena dispansa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant spreads through both seed dispersal and vegetative growth, making it a persistent weed in forested and riparian areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its impact on indigenous biodiversity.</p>
