                <h1>Actinotus bellidioides</h1>
<p>Actinotus bellidioides, commonly known as the bellidifolium starflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Actinotus, which is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with five petals that curve inward, creating a bell-like appearance.</p>
<p>Actinotus bellidioides is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus bellidioides has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 3 to 7 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and covered in fine hairs, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with five white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for nutrient absorption in its native rocky and dry habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus bellidioides is primarily native to Tasmania and Victoria.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in open vegetation or on rocky slopes. The species is known for its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the highland flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus bellidioides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, star-shaped white flowers. The plant is native to southern Africa and has since become naturalized in certain regions of New Zealand. It is often found growing in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited and it does not pose a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
