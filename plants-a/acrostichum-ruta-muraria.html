                <h1>Acrostichum ruta-muraria</h1>
<p>Acrostichum ruta-muraria, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble a holly leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ruta-muraria has compound, feather-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with each leaflet being narrow and linear, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length and a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a rough, dark brown bark that has a slightly furrowed texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ruta-muraria is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is particularly adapted to brackish water conditions and can tolerate varying salinity levels. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ruta-muraria was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in coastal and wetland areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and saline soils, such as mangrove ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and dense root system make it effective for preventing soil erosion. However, its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in several coastal regions worldwide.</p>
