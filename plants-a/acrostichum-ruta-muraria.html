<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, branching fronds that resemble antlers, hence its common name. The plant has a thick, leathery rachis that serves as a protective structure for its delicate, delicate fronds. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates.</p>
<p>Acrostichum ruta-muraria is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments, where it can receive the necessary light and humidity for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ruta-muraria has leaves that are alternate, lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are typically 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, fibrous bark that is brown in color, and it exhibits a clump-forming growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that disperses its tiny seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ruta-muraria is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in rocky, well-drained soils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ruta-muraria is a hardy, low-maintenance plant commonly used in ornamental and medicinal gardening.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year, making it ideal for quick landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage bushier foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's overall health.</p>
