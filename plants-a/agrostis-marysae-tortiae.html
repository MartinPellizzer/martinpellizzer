                    <h1>Agrostis marysae-tortiae</h1>
<p>Agrostis marysae-tortiae, commonly known as the Marysae-Tortiae bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in coastal or mountainous areas where it tolerates high sunlight and variable moisture conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
