<p>Angiopteris ferox, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which help in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
<p>Angiopteris ferox plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
