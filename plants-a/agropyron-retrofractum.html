                    <h1>Agropyron retrofractum</h1>
<p>Agropyron retrofractum, commonly known as the prickly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold, arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tough, fibrous stems and sharp, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often found in steppes, prairies, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Agropyron retrofractum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration ecology projects.</p>
