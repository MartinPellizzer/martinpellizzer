                <h1>Aconitum odontandrum</h1>
<p>Aconitum odontandrum, commonly known as the toothed aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its roots are tuberous, which store nutrients for the plant.</p>
<p>Aconitum odontandrum is known for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum odontandrum has leaves that are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, dark green on top, and pale underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and typically has a bluish-green color, growing in a clump-like pattern. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred shape, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
