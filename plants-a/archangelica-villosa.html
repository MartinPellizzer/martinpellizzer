                    <h1>Archangelica villosa</h1>
<p>Archangelica villosa, commonly known as hairy angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, compound leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which are followed by oval, dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
