                    <h1>Acacia grisea</h1>
<p>Acacia grisea, commonly known as the grey acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, greyish-green branches and compound leaves that are often reduced to spines, a feature common in many acacia species as a defense mechanism. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by flat, linear pods containing seeds. Acacia grisea is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals and insects.</p>
