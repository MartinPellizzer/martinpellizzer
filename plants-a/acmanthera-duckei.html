                <h1>Acmanthera duckei</h1>
<p>Acmanthera duckei, commonly known as the duck's egg vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, egg-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, green, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique blooms.</p>
<p>Acmanthera duckei thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmanthera duckei has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 3â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that develops fissures with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmanthera duckei is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced and sometimes becomes invasive. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Acmanthera duckei typically grows at low altitudes, between 0 and 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies and habitat disruption, it is considered a species of concern in some regions, though its conservation status remains largely unstudied.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmanthera duckei is a striking flowering plant native to tropical regions, known for its vibrant blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acmanthera duckei includes a period of active growth in warm seasons, followed by a dormant phase during cooler months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage blooming. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmanthera duckei is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
