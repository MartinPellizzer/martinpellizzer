                <h1>Acmanthera duckei</h1>
<p>Acmanthera duckei, commonly known as the yellow larkspur, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acmanthera duckei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmanthera duckei has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically a deep green color and have a smooth surface. The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the summer months; they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmanthera duckei is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northern regions of Brazil, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall. Acmanthera duckei is commonly associated with moist forest understories and riverine areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmanthera duckei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, farms, and waste lands. It is considered a weed due to its invasive nature and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been well-documented in ecological studies focusing on invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
