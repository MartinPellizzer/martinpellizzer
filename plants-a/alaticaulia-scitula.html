<p>Alaticaulia scitula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Alaticaulia scitula plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
