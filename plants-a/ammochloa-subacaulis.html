                    <h1>Ammochloa subacaulis</h1>
<p>Ammochloa subacaulis, commonly known as the coastal grass or sand couch, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of salinity and drought. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Ammochloa subacaulis plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
