                    <h1>Aristida adscensionis var. pumila</h1>
<p>Aristida adscensionis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky blades that often form a mat-like structure on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments.</p>
