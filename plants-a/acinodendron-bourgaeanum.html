<p>Acinodendron bourgaeanum, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble bells, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bourgaeanum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal ingestion and excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bourgaeanum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments, often found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation, where it can establish itself quickly. It prefers well-drained soils and is often seen in mixed tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the islands of the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bourgaeanum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant has been reported in several countries where it has established itself in natural or disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some regions.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
