<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>schneiderianum, commonly known as the Campbell's maple, is a rare and striking ornamental tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It prefers cool, moist climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare species in the wild.</p>
