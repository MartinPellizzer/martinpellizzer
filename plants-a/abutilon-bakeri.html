<p>Abutilon bakeri, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in late summer. Abutilon bakeri thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in hot, dry climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon bakeri has ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and often reddish-brown in color, with a smooth texture and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petals forming a bell shape, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, displaying shades of yellow or orange; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bakeri is a shrub native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Yemen.</p>
<p>Although it was once widespread on Socotra, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in the northern and central parts of the island. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on limestone substrates. Abutilon bakeri is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon bakeri is a fast-growing, semi-evergreen shrub that thrives in warm climates and is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for producing identical plants. The growth cycle of Abutilon bakeri is typically seasonal, with new growth emerging in spring and flowering occurring in summer or early fall.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage flowering. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like leaf spot can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve the overall garden ecosystem.</p>
