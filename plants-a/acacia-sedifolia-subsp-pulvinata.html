<p>Acacia sedifolia subsp.</p>
<p>pulvinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to autumn, which are grouped in cylindrical spikes. It has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are reduced to phyllodes, a common adaptation in the genus Acacia to reduce water loss.</p>
