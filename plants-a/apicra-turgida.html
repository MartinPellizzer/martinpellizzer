                    <h1>Apicra turgida</h1>
<p>Apicra turgida, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized bladders used for capturing small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving or still waters with soft substrates. The plant's morphology includes elongated, cylindrical bladders that are inflated to trap prey, while the rest of the plant consists of thin, leaf-like structures. Apicra turgida is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous adaptations.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant evolution and ecological interactions.</p>
