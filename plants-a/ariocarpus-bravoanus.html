<p>Ariocarpus bravoanus, commonly known as the Bravo's liverwort cactus, is a unique succulent native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded body and a dense covering of pale green to whitish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle floral display. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Ariocarpus bravoanus is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
