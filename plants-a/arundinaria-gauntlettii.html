<p>Arundinaria gauntlettii, commonly known as the Gauntlett's bamboo, is a rare and endangered grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, well-drained soils along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
