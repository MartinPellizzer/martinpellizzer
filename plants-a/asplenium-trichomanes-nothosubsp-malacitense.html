<p>Asplenium trichomanes nothosubsp.</p>
<p>malacitense, commonly known as the Malacitense spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, evergreen, and densely packed fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is likely a hybrid or variant of the broader A. trichomanes species, exhibiting slight morphological differences.</p>
