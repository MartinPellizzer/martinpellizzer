                <h1>Aconitum napellus</h1>
<p>Aconitum napellus, commonly known as the Italian wolfsbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a rough texture. Aconitum napellus contains potent alkaloids, including aconitine, which make it highly toxic and potentially lethal if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for its ornamental value rather than for medicinal use.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus has leaves that are compound, consisting of 5 to 11 lance-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they can reach up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often branching and capable of storing nutrients for the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes. This plant is also native to parts of western Asia, including regions such as Turkey and the Caucasus. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Aconitum napellus is known for its striking blue or purple flowers and has a long history of use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, often in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas, though it is not considered a major ecological threat in all regions. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to reproduce both sexually and through rhizomes, allowing it to establish in new locations.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Aconitum napellus is highly toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
