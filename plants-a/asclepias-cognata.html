<p>Asclepias cognata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, velvety leaves that are broad and ovate, often with a slight serration along the edges. It produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies.</p>
<p>Asclepias cognata plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
