<p>Acalypha rottleroides, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is both cultivated and considered a weed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha rottleroides has palmate leaves that are broadly ovate to triangular in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, displaying a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with male and female flowers on separate plants, typically yellow or green in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in nutrient absorption and stabilizing the plant in its habitat.</p>
