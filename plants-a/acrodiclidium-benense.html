                <h1>Acrodiclidium benense</h1>
<p>Acrodiclidium benense, commonly known as the Benin spurge, is a flowering plant native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the genus.</p>
<p>Acrodiclidium benense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium benense has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environment by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium benense is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Pernambuco, Paraíba, and Piauí. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and scrublands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium benense was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in regions of South America, especially in Brazil and parts of Peru. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activity, such as trade and horticultural practices.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has established itself in several new habitats outside its native range.</p>
