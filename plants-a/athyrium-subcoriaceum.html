                    <h1>Athyrium subcoriaceum</h1>
<p>Athyrium subcoriaceum, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that give it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves.</p>
