                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. obtusangulatum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. obtusangulatum, commonly known as the Irish maple or rounded-leaved maple, is a variant of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically shorter and wider than those of the standard species. The plant is native to western Europe, particularly Ireland, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring followed by red or orange samaras in autumn.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. obtusangulatum has broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dull green on top and lighter underneath, with a wavy margin and a rounded apex.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure with separate sepals and petals. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The root system is shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. obtusangulatum is a variant of the maple tree originally native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in southern Spain, where it grows in rocky or limestone soils. It thrives in temperate climates at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, this form is considered rare and is listed as near threatened by some conservation organizations.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted range make it a valuable subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. obtusangulatum is a unique form of the maple tree known for its distinctive, rounded leaf shape.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the desired cultivar traits. This plant grows best in temperate climates, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing during spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though it may be susceptible to aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. obtusangulatum is a unique variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that holds soil in place.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a habitat for numerous organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. obtusangulatum is a rare variant of the maple tree known primarily for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscaping due to its distinctive leaf shape.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves have been historically explored for potential medicinal properties, though scientific evidence remains limited. In industrial contexts, it contributes to the forestry sector by providing timber for minor construction and craft purposes. Culturally, it is often admired for its aesthetic appeal and is used in botanical gardens to showcase genetic variation.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the diversity and adaptability of plant life within ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. obtusangulatum has a range of popular cultivars such as 'Argenteum' and 'Atropurpureum', which are prized for their striking foliage colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>This form is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, making it a favorite among gardeners and landscapers. It has also been hybridized with other maple species, leading to the development of unique varieties with enhanced traits like improved hardiness or more vibrant leaf coloration. These hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees available for cultivation in different climates.</p>
<p>Overall, its horticultural importance lies in its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
