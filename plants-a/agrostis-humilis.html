                    <h1>Agrostis humilis</h1>
<p>Agrostis humilis, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Agrostis humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and golf course maintenance.</p>
