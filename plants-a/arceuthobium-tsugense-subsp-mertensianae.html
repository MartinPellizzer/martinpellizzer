<p>Arceuthobium tsugense subsp.</p>
<p>mertensianae, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests fir trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, obtaining water and minerals through its haustoria.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. These seeds are dispersed when the berries are shaken by wind or animals, allowing the plant to spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it an important ecological component in forest ecosystems.</p>
