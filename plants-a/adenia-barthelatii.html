                <h1>Adenia barthelatii</h1>
<p>Adenia barthelatii, commonly known as the Barthelat's adenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, five-petaled flowers that attract various pollinators. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia barthelatii has elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a slightly serrated edge and a length of about 10-15 cm.</p>
<p>Its stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to grey in color, and they grow in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia barthelatii is primarily native to the Comoros.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of these islands, which are located in the Indian Ocean. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the Comoros, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia barthelatii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate to high humidity. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests. Its introduction has been associated with horticultural interests due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
