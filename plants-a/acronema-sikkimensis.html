                <h1>Acronema sikkimensis</h1>
<p>Acronema sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim acronema, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. It produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its leaves are finely divided and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema sikkimensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the moist, forest floor environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema sikkimensis is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories at moderate to high elevations. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with mixed evergreen and coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific altitudinal ranges, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema sikkimensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native habitat, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
