                    <h1>Acantholimon acerosum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon acerosum, commonly known as the hard-leaved flax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
