                    <h1>Agasta</h1>
<p>Agasta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Agasta is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
