                <h1>Acnistus spinescens</h1>
<p>Acnistus spinescens, commonly known as the spiny acnistus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its woody stems and dense, thorny foliage. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a rough, sometimes hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acnistus spinescens is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to dry or semi-arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus spinescens has small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and covered with spines, displaying a reddish-brown color and a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in dry, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus spinescens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern and eastern Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with humid lowland and montane forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus spinescens was mainly introduced to regions where it has become an invasive species, often escaping from cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in several parts of the world.</p>
