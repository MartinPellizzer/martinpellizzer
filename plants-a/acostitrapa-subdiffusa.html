                <h1>Acostitrapa subdiffusa</h1>
<p>Acostitrapa subdiffusa, commonly known as the diffuse acostitrapa, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are small and clustered in a composite head.</p>
<p>Acostitrapa subdiffusa is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acostitrapa subdiffusa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dull green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and feature five white petals with yellow stamens; they bloom in early spring and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
