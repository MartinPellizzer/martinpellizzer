                <h1>Aechmea caudata</h1>
<p>Aechmea caudata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces a tall flower spike with vibrant red and orange bracts, which are showy but not edible. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Aechmea caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea caudata has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and dark green with a waxy coating, arranged in a compact circle around the central stem.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains hidden most of the time. The plant produces striking inflorescences with red bracts that enclose white to pink flowers, blooming in late winter to early spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its epiphytic or terrestrial habitat.</p>
