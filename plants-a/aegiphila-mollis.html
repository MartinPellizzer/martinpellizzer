                <h1>Aegiphila mollis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. Aegiphila mollis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila mollis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-white underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soils and arid conditions.</p>
