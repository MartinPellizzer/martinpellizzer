                <h1>Actinocephalus heteropus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus heteropus, commonly known as the spiral flax, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are typically clustered in a head-like structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive spiral pattern that aids in light absorption.</p>
<p>The spiral flax is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus heteropus has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green and arranged in pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, blooming in spring and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus heteropus is primarily native to the Cape Province of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique vegetation and biodiversity. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open, sunny areas. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus heteropus is often found in coastal and mountainous regions within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus heteropus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it particularly problematic in forested regions.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
