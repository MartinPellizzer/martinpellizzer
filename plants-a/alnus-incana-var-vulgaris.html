                    <h1>Alnus incana var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Alnus incana var. vulgaris, commonly known as gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Gray alder is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
