                    <h1>Androsace armeniaca</h1>
<p>Androsace armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
