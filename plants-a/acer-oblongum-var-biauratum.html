                <h1>Acer oblongum var. biauratum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. biauratum, commonly known as the twin-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves, which are often twice-lobed, giving it its varietal name "biauratum.". The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red to orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters and has a moderate growth rate.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its vibrant fall foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. biauratum has elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge; the leaves are alternate in arrangement and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white inflorescences that appear in early spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. biauratum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in these areas, making it increasingly rare. It thrives in cool, moist temperate environments, typically found in dense forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat destruction and limited natural regeneration, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. biauratum is a unique maple variety known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care and companion plants like lavender or marigolds.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. biauratum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and supporting other flora. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of organisms in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. biauratum is a lesser-known plant with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation is still pending. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and can be part of ecological restoration projects. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some regions as a representative of native flora.</p>
<p>Its role in landscaping and ornamental gardening also highlights its aesthetic and environmental applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. biauratum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Crown,' which display striking autumn coloration.</p>
<p>It is also used in hybridization with other maple species to create new varieties with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness or more vibrant foliage. These hybrids often exhibit unique leaf shapes and colors, making them desirable in horticulture. The species plays a significant role in landscape design due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees in gardens and public spaces.</p>
