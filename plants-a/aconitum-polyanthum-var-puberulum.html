<p>Aconitum polyanthum var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture due to its pubescent surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>
