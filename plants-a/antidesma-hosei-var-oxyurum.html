                    <h1>Antidesma hosei var. oxyurum</h1>
<p>Antidesma hosei var. oxyurum, commonly known as the white antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually pale green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
