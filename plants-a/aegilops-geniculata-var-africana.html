                    <h1>Aegilops geniculata var. africana</h1>
<p>Aegilops geniculata var. africana, commonly known as the African wild barley, is a wild grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in cultivated barley species.</p>
