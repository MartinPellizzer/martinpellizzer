                <h1>Actaea frigida</h1>
<p>Actaea frigida, commonly known as the Arctic black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It grows in rocky, moist soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in early summer, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Actaea frigida is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in the ecosystems of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea frigida has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are palmately lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more grayish with age, and it grows upright with a single stem per plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in an upright cyme during late spring to early summer, which are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dark red to black, spherical berry that contains several seeds, and it is dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish new growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea frigida is primarily native to China South-Central, East Himalaya, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Tibet, West Himalaya.</p>
<p>It is found in high-altitude regions across these areas. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It is commonly found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to cold and temperate climates in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea frigida was mainly introduced to the northern regions of North America, particularly in Alaska and Canada, where it thrives in cold, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine tundra and boreal forest edges, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has been documented in several protected areas and is considered a key indicator species for high-elevation ecosystems. Its introduction to these regions is largely due to its natural dispersal through wind and animal activity.</p>
<p>However, its presence in these areas is still limited to specific microhabitats that match its ecological requirements.</p>
