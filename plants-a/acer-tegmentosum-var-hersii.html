                <h1>Acer tegmentosum var. hersii</h1>
<p>Acer tegmentosum var. hersii, commonly known as the Red Maple or Red-leaf Maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adaptable to a range of light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum var. hersii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing via wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum var. hersii is a rare variant of the sugar maple, native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now found in a few isolated locations, mainly in the eastern Himalayas and parts of northern India. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests and along stream banks. It grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters, where the climate is cool and the soil is rich and well-drained.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum var. hersii is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering quicker results. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum var. hersii is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum var. hersii is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It is also used in the production of decorative wood, contributing to local economies in regions where it is native. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some indigenous communities, representing resilience and natural beauty. While not widely used in industrial applications, its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and cultural than commercial.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum var. hersii has several popular cultivars, including 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson Queen', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced foliage and hardiness. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates and soils, making them more widely cultivated. The horticultural importance of Acer tegmentosum var. hersii lies in its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in urban landscapes.</p>
<p>As a result, it is increasingly favored by landscape designers and gardeners for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
