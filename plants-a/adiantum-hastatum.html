                <h1>Adiantum hastatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum hastatum, commonly known as the water maid or the basket fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a finely divided, lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum hastatum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum hastatum has feather-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, narrow, and arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stems. The stems are slender, upright, and have a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a rosette or clumping formation. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and these spores are released from the underside of the leaves during the late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hastatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and moist environments. This fern thrives in shaded, forested areas near streams or in mountainous regions. It is often associated with limestone substrates and is considered an epiphytic or lithophytic species.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hastatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. The species has since become naturalized in various parts of the country, particularly in coastal and wetland areas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
