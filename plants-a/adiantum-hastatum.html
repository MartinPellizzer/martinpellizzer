<p>Adiantum hastatum, commonly known as the water maid or the basket fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a finely divided, lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum hastatum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
