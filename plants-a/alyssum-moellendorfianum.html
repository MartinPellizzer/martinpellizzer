                    <h1>Alyssum moellendorfianum</h1>
<p>Alyssum moellendorfianum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a favored plant in both landscaping and horticultural collections.</p>
