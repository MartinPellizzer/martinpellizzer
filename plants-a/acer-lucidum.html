                <h1>Acer lucidum</h1>
<p>Acer lucidum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which ranges from bright red to orange and yellow. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer lucidum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along rivers and streams.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lucidum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure with separate sepals and petals. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind after maturing in late summer.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lucidum is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was historically limited to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, as an ornamental species. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks or in forest understories. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters, preferring partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, leading to concerns about its long-term survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lucidum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer lucidum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or leaf spot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lucidum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local ecosystems. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lucidum contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lucidum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds can be used in traditional herbal remedies.
