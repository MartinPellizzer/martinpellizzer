<p>Azorella pedunculata, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Azorella pedunculata is well adapted to cold, arid conditions and is often found in alpine and paramo ecosystems.</p>
