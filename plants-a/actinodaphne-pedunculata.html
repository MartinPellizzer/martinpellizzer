                <h1>Actinodaphne pedunculata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne pedunculata, commonly known as the fragrant sandalwood tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, woody bark and simple, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces drupes that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its fragrant wood, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pedunculata has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring 5â€“12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its small, clustered flowers are greenish-white with a faint fragrance, blooming from July to October, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing primarily by birds eating the fruit and dispersing the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pedunculata is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southern regions of China, particularly in provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical forest environments. The plant is often associated with moist, shaded areas in the undergrowth of these forests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic region within China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pedunculata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value and potential for ecological benefits make it an attractive species for cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for garden landscapes and reforestation projects. The plant's introduction has been associated with both horticultural interests and efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to ensure it does not become a threat to local biodiversity.</p>
