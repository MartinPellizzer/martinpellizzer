                <h1>Acidocroton horridus</h1>
<p>Acidocroton horridus, commonly known as the spiked croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and vibrant, colorful flowers that range from red to orange. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap and diverse species. Acidocroton horridus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires careful handling due to its toxic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton horridus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, displaying a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with a compact, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellow petals and green sepals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and wasps. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton horridus is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Oceania and some regions in northern Australia, where it has been introduced. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its population.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acidocroton horridus is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub known for its vibrant, colorful leaves and spiky foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant thrives in a warm, humid climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during winter.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, but it should be allowed to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by scale insects and root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like ferns or bromeliads can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a lush, tropical garden environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acidocroton horridus is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and improving soil structure.</p>
<p>Acidocroton horridus also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the balance of its native habitat.</p>
