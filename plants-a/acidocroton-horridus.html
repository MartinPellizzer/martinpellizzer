                <h1>Acidocroton horridus</h1>
<p>Acidocroton horridus, commonly known as the roughleaf croton, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and visually striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton horridus has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly waxy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually reddish-brown in color. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring yellowish-green petals and stamens, and they bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton horridus is primarily native to Haiti.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the local soil conditions and rainfall patterns of Haiti.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton horridus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an aggressive invader in many ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its spread, it is considered a potential weed in several regions where it has been introduced.</p>
