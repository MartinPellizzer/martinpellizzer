                <h1>Acrostichum nanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum nanum, commonly known as the small fern or dwarf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves.</p>
<p>Acrostichum nanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nanum has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 10–20 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a smooth, glossy green surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nanum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in moist, humid environments. This plant is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found along estuaries and tidal flats. It is well adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from the Caribbean islands to the northern regions of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nanum was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in salt marshes and mangrove swamps. This plant has been reported in several states including Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina. Its introduction is believed to be through natural dispersal via water currents or human activities.</p>
<p>It has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
