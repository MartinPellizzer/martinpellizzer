<p>Alyssum calycinum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its extended blooming period, which can last from late spring through early autumn.</p>
