                        <h1>Abrotanella rosulata</h1>
<p>Abrotanella rosulata, commonly known as the clustered rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display.</p>
