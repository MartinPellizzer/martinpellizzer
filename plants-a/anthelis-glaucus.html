                    <h1>Anthelis glaucus</h1>
<p>Anthelis glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous anthelis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Anthelis glaucus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
