                <h1>Acinodendron andinum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron andinum, commonly known as the Andean acacia, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its root system is adapted to thrive in poor, rocky soils typical of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Acinodendron andinum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron andinum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a creeping or trailing pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with five petals and stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron andinum is primarily native to the high Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cloud forests and mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats in the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron andinum was mainly introduced to specific regions in South America, particularly in countries like Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is often found in humid montane forests and cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. This plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. It is primarily distributed in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections in other parts of the world.</p>
