                    <h1>Allosorus foveolatus</h1>
<p>Allosorus foveolatus, commonly known as the sand mat, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows on sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained environments. The plant has a compact rosette structure with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Allosorus foveolatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
