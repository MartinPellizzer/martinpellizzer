                    <h1>Acacia angustissima var. shrevei</h1>
<p>Acacia angustissima var. shrevei, commonly known as Shreve's narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
