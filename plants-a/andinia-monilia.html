                    <h1>Andinia monilia</h1>
<p>Andinia monilia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique and rare plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on the edges of glaciers. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom during the short growing season in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Andinia monilia is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
