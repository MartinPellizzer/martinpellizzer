                    <h1>Angelica harae</h1>
<p>Angelica harae, commonly known as the Japanese angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>This perennial herb typically grows in moist, temperate regions of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. Its tall, hollow stems are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are compound, with a pinnate structure. The plant produces small white to greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Angelica harae is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its use is less common compared to other angelica species.</p>
