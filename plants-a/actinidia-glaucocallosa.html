                <h1>Actinidia glaucocallosa</h1>
<p>Actinidia glaucocallosa, commonly known as the silver-furred kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have a unique, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes due to its hardy nature and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia glaucocallosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a pale, often whitish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a yellow to orange berry that matures in late summer, containing small, elongated seeds dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it to climb and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia glaucocallosa is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The species is commonly associated with forested areas and slopes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic region in China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia glaucocallosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fruiting habits. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
