                    <h1>Arundarbor breviflora</h1>
<p>Arundarbor breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered arundine, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
