                        <h1>Acaena pumila var. acrocoma</h1>
<p>Acaena pumila var. acrocoma, commonly known as the small burrweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny bracts that form dense clusters, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pumila var. acrocoma is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean region.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. This plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with cool, temperate climates. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern Andes, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pumila var. acrocoma was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
