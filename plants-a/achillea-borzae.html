                <h1>Achillea borzae</h1>
<p>Achillea borzae, commonly known as the Borzănska yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, featuring narrow, gray-green leaves and flat, yellowish-white flower clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea borzae has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea borzae is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, primarily found in Georgia and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific high-altitude areas within these countries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and slopes. The plant grows at altitudes ranging from 1,800 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, Achillea borzae is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea borzae is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea borzae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, which contribute to the local ecosystem's health. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Achillea borzae also plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea borzae is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe and Asia, known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may incorporate its flowers for flavoring or preservation. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, though its use remains limited compared to other members of the Asteraceae family. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, which is economically valuable for agriculture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though its role in symbolism is less documented than that of more widely recognized plants.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea borzae has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Pink Beauty' and 'White Beauty,' which are known for their showy, flat-topped flower heads and aromatic foliage. While natural hybrids of Achillea borzae are less common, crossbreeding with other yarrow species has led to the development of new cultivars with enhanced color and hardiness. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in poor soils and their long blooming period.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens for their beauty and low maintenance requirements.</p>
