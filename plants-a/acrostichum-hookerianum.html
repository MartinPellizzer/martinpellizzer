                <h1>Acrostichum hookerianum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum hookerianum, commonly known as the Hooker's hibiscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in tidal marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its native wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hookerianum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, feather-like shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like surface that is typically grayish-brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hookerianum is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including parts of Hawaii, Tahiti, and other tropical regions of Oceania.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and saltwater tidal zones. This plant is well adapted to saline conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hookerianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, where it has established itself in coastal and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and sandy or clay soils, often near freshwater sources. This plant is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several islands within the Hawaiian archipelago, as well as in parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activities, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport.</p>
