                <h1>Acer rotundilobum</h1>
<p>Acer rotundilobum, commonly known as the round-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with rounded lobes, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rich forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rotundilobum has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rounded apex and serrated margins, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with a winged seed, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rotundilobum is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in these regions. It thrives in humid, temperate forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer rotundilobum is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rotundilobum is a small, slow-growing ornamental tree known for its unique, rounded leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle of this species is typically slow, with significant growth occurring in the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is mainly for shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rotundilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant, enhancing biodiversity in forest ecosystems. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting soil health through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rotundilobum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages. While not widely used in industrial applications, its wood may have niche uses in crafting or as a source of timber in local economies. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains more ecological and ornamental than utilitarian in most contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rotundilobum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that contribute to its horticultural significance.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Queen' and 'Coral焰', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer rotundilobum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness, disease resistance, and ornamental value. These plants are valued in gardens for their unique foliage and ability to thrive in a range of conditions.</p>
<p>Their adaptability and aesthetic appeal make them a favored choice for landscape design and urban gardening.</p>
