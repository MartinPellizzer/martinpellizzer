                    <h1>Aloitis</h1>
<p>Aloitis, commonly known as the ice plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to South Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers. They thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making them well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Aloitis species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Their ability to store water in their leaves helps them survive in dry climates.</p>
