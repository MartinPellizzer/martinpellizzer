<p>Abutilon durangense, commonly known as the Durango velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its woolly, fuzzy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in scrublands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Abutilon durangense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon durangense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length and 3–6 cm in width.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green on the upper surface and paler underneath, with a slightly pubescent texture. The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown or reddish-brown, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are pendulous, with a cup-shaped calyx and five petals, usually yellow or orange in color, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptic seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon durangense is a species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, specifically in the states of Durango and Zacatecas.</p>
<p>It is currently found in fragmented populations within its original range, though its distribution has become more restricted due to habitat loss. This plant thrives in dry, rocky environments with well-drained soils, often growing in open woodlands or on slopes. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat degradation, Abutilon durangense is listed as endangered in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon durangense is a flowering plant native to Mexico, known for its vibrant, showy bracts and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has an annual growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in the colder months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are beneficial, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
