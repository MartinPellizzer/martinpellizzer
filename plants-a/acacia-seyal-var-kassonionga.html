                        <h1>Acacia seyal var. kassonionga</h1>
<p>Acacia seyal var. kassonionga, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, yellow flowers that bloom in globular clusters. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods containing seeds, and its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, feather-like leaflets. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The wood of this acacia is hard and durable, making it valuable for local use in construction and fuel.</p>
