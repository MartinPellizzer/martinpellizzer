<p>Achillea nana var. conferta, commonly known as the dense yarrow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, bright yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a soft, fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nana var. conferta has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped, dark green with a silvery underside, and arranged in a rosette formation, typically ranging from 2 to 6 inches in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a grayish-green color and a growth pattern that is clump-forming. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
