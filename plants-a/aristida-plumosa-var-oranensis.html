                    <h1>Aristida plumosa var. oranensis</h1>
<p>Aristida plumosa var. oranensis, commonly known as the silky grass or silky arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, pale-green to brownish flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and dry gardens.</p>
