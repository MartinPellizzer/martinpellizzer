<p>Aegilops ventricosa subsp.</p>
<p>fragilis, commonly known as the fragile spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential role in ecological restoration and its genetic relationship to wheat species.</p>
