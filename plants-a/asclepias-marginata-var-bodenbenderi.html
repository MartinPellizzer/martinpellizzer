                    <h1>Asclepias marginata var. bodenbenderi</h1>
<p>Asclepias marginata var. bodenbenderi, commonly known as the Bodenbender's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hood-like structures that attract various pollinators. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly important for the survival of the monarch butterfly, as it provides a host plant for their larvae.</p>
