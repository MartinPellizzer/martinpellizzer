                <h1>Acuan fruticosum</h1>
<p>Acuan fruticosum, commonly known as the fruit-bearing acuan, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are small berries that ripen to a reddish color, attracting various bird species.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan fruticosum has leaves that are simple, ovate in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that peels off in thin flakes as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with four petals and stamen, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan fruticosum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often found in scrublands and coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with arid and semi-arid climates, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions. Its distribution extends to areas such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan fruticosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sunlight. The plant is commonly found in temperate climates, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and parts of Europe. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to several countries outside its native range.</p>
