<p>Achillea argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Silverleaf yarrow is often used in herbal remedies and as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea argyrophylla has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base and branching sparingly. The flowers are yellow, forming flat-topped clusters called cymes, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea argyrophylla is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now distributed across parts of the western U.S. and has been introduced to other regions, including the Pacific Northwest. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Achillea argyrophylla is listed as a species of concern in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea argyrophylla is a hardy perennial known for its silver-blue foliage and showy yellow flowers, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, with cuttings also being a viable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and early summer, with a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>
