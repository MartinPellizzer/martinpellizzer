                    <h1>Aira alpina var. rhenana</h1>
<p>Aira alpina var. rhenana, commonly known as the Alpine air grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
