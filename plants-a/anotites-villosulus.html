<p>Anotites villosulus, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Anotites villosulus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for aquatic life.</p>
