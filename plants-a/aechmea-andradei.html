                <h1>Aechmea andradei</h1>
<p>Aechmea andradei, commonly known as the Andrade's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically green with a waxy texture and can develop a reddish or bronze hue as they mature. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea andradei has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, silver-green color and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, stocky stem with a fibrous, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, with bright red bracts and small white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous small seeds, dispersed by animals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, forming a dense network around the base of the plant to anchor it and absorb moisture.</p>
