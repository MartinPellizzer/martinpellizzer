                <h1>Acinos erectus</h1>
<p>Acinos erectus, commonly known as the upright acornweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Acinos erectus is known for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos erectus has simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped, hairy, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in dense tufts or clumps. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense heads, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos erectus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in open areas with full sun exposure. It is also present in parts of northern Africa, including Morocco and Algeria.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with cold, dry climates and well-drained soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos erectus was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in mountainous or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, such as parts of Europe and North America. This plant thrives in open landscapes and is often seen in meadows, slopes, and disturbed sites. Its introduction has been documented in several ecological studies focusing on alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common sight in regions where it has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced.</p>
