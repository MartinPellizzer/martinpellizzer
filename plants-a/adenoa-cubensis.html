                <h1>Adenoa cubensis</h1>
<p>Adenoa cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban adenophora, is a flowering plant native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and sturdy.</p>
<p>Adenoa cubensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoa cubensis has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoa cubensis is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found throughout the island, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy or disturbed soils. It is commonly associated with open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoa cubensis was mainly introduced to Florida, United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, vacant lots, and urban environments. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in residential and commercial landscapes. It has been reported in several counties across Florida, particularly in the southern and central regions.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
