                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. laevis</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. laevis, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and slightly hairy, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and resilience, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping and turfgrass mixes.</p>
