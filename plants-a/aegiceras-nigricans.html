                <h1>Aegiceras nigricans</h1>
<p>Aegiceras nigricans, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering pollutants. The plant's distinctive feature is its salt-excreting glands, which allow it to tolerate high salinity levels. Its small, dark green leaves are typically arranged in whorls, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Aegiceras nigricans is an essential component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiceras nigricans has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from March to May, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients from the environment.</p>
