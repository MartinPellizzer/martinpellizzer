The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological restoration.</p>
