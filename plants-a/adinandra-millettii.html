                <h1>Adinandra millettii</h1>
<p>Adinandra millettii, commonly known as the millettii tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra millettii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra millettii is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It typically grows in lowland forests and secondary vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the biodiversity hotspots of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra millettii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, making it suitable for forest understories and disturbed sites. The plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Its introduction has sometimes led to its naturalization in new habitats, expanding its ecological footprint.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in warmer regions.</p>
