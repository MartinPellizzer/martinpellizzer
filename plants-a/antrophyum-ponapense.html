                    <h1>Antrophyum ponapense</h1>
<p>Antrophyum ponapense, commonly known as the Ponape cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Ponape in the Caroline Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones instead of flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
