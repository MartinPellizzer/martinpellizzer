                    <h1>Alectorolophus arcticus</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>The Arctic bellflower plays an important role in pollination and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem.</p>
