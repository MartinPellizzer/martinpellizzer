<p>Acacia pinguiculosa subsp.</p>
<p>pinguiculosa, commonly known as the sticky acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular foliage that secretes a sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize transpiration in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
