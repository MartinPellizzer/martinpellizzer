<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon chachapoyense is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in the northern highlands of Peru and parts of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cloud forests and humid montane environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils, often growing along stream banks and in rocky crevices. It is an important species in the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon chachapoyense was mainly introduced to regions with a temperate climate and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
