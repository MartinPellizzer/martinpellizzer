                <h1>Acis fabrei</h1>
<p>Acis fabrei, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis fabrei has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, glossy green surface and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis fabrei is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, where it grows in humid, shaded environments within forests. It typically thrives at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Acis fabrei is considered endangered, and its conservation status is of great concern.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to protect and preserve this rare species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acis fabrei is a flowering plant known for its delicate, bell-shaped blooms and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acis fabrei involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer, and a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging, with watering reduced during dormancy. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage blooming. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve the overall garden ecosystem.</p>
