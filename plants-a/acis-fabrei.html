<p>Acis fabrei, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acis fabrei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis fabrei has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
