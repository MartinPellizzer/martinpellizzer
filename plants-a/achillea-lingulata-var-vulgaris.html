                <h1>Achillea lingulata var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. vulgaris, commonly known as common yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that consist of many small white to pinkish florets. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Common yarrow is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. vulgaris has leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a serrated margin, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a gray-green to silver-white color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a light green to brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, composite flower heads composed of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to light pink ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. vulgaris is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas in the Mediterranean basin, where it has been introduced in some regions outside its native range. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating that it is not currently threatened with extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. vulgaris is a hardy perennial known for its compact, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstock in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its appearance and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. vulgaris is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter accumulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. vulgaris is a plant known for its historical and contemporary uses across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, it has been used to flavor dishes and as a spice in some traditional recipes. Medicinally, it has been utilized for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Industrially, it contributes to the production of essential oils and natural dyes.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes protection and resilience, often appearing in folklore and traditional medicine practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea lingulata var. vulgaris has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated in gardens for their ornamental value, including 'Aurea' and 'Lime Green', which are known for their bright yellow foliage.</p>
<p>While there are fewer hybrids specifically developed for this variety compared to other yarrow species, some crossbreeding with related species like Achillea millefolium has produced cultivars with enhanced color and vigor. These plants are valued in horticulture for their drought tolerance, long blooming period, and ability to attract beneficial insects. Their versatility in landscaping makes them a popular choice for rock gardens, borders, and wildflower mixes.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea lingulata var. vulgaris remains an important plant in both traditional and modern garden design.</p>
