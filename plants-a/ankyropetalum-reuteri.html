                    <h1>Ankyropetalum reuteri</h1>
<p>Ankyropetalum reuteri, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family.</p>
<p>It primarily infests coniferous trees, such as pines and firs, and derives its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or purple in color, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Ankyropetalum reuteri is native to various regions in Europe and North America, where it plays a role in forest ecosystems despite its parasitic nature.</p>
<p>Its growth is often limited to the canopy of its host, where it forms dense clusters of foliage.</p>
