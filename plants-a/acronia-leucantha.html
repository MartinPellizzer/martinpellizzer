                <h1>Acronia leucantha</h1>
<p>Acronia leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered acronia, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical and evergreen, providing a dense canopy that supports various wildlife.</p>
<p>Acronia leucantha thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia leucantha has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia leucantha is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This species thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with pine flatwood and wet pine savanna ecosystems. Acronia leucantha is a small, flowering plant that contributes to the biodiversity of these unique habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the environmental conditions match its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia leucantha was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woods, and along stream banks. This plant is often spread through seed dispersal by wind, water, or animals. It has become established in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
