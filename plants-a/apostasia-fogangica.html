<p>Apostasia fogangica, commonly known as the Fogang lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its unique inflorescence of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and specialized structures for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Apostasia fogangica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
