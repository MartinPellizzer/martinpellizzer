                <h1>Acineta superba</h1>
<p>Acineta superba, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Acineta superba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta superba has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta superba is primarily native to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. Acineta superba is well adapted to the cool and humid climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these South American nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta superba was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with moderate to high rainfall. The plant thrives in regions with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native locations, including parts of the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
