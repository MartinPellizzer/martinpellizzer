                <h1>Adinandra robinsonii</h1>
<p>Adinandra robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's adinandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It produces small, round berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra robinsonii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern with branches emerging from the main trunk. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra robinsonii is primarily native to the western portion of the Malay Peninsula, including parts of Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is also found in some regions of Sumatra, Indonesia. This plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, often in shaded, humid environments. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra robinsonii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution is largely restricted to cultivation rather than being a native species in these areas. It is commonly found in home gardens and landscaped areas across the region.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on local ecosystems.</p>
