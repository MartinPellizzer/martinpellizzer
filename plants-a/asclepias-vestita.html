                    <h1>Asclepias vestita</h1>
<p>Asclepias vestita, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pods that split open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias vestita is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars.</p>
<p>Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which make it toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for certain pollinators.</p>
