                    <h1>Acacia kelleri</h1>
<p>Acacia kelleri, commonly known as the desert wattle, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seed pods are woody and contain numerous small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia kelleri is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can go for long periods without rainfall.</p>
