                <h1>Acmena australis</h1>
<p>Acmena australis, commonly known as the satinash tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen tree with glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena australis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a spreading growth pattern that often forms a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, white or pale green, with five petals and a short floral tube, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena australis is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It thrives in subtropical and temperate climates, often found in coastal areas and near riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with rainforests and wetlands, where it forms dense understorey vegetation. It is well adapted to moist, fertile soils and can tolerate occasional flooding.</p>
<p>Acmena australis is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena australis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and parks across regions with temperate climates, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. The plant's ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade makes it a popular choice for urban and suburban landscapes. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-target environments.</p>
