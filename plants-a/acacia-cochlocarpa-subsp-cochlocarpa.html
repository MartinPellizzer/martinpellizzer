<p>Acacia cochlocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>cochlocarpa, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>This species is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
