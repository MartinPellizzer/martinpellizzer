<p>It typically thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Austrochthamalia humifusa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
