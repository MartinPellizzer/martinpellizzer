                <h1>Achras conzattii</h1>
<p>Achras conzattii, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a large, evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and broad, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by large, round fruits that resemble bread. The fruit is edible when ripe, with a starchy, sweet flesh that can be baked or boiled.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in both local ecosystems and human cultures for its nutritional value and versatility in culinary uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras conzattii has large, palmate leaves that are broad and lobed, arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale gray bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in a branched inflorescence, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, fibrous capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb water from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras conzattii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Florida in the United States. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. Its natural habitat includes wetlands and areas with high humidity and saline conditions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras conzattii was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly in parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its adaptability to various soil types. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, especially for its large, palm-like leaves. It has also been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions as a horticultural plant.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in these areas.</p>
