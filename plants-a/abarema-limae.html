                <h1>Abarema limae</h1>
<p>Abarema limae, commonly known as the Brazilian peacock flower, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble peacock feathers. The plant features compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abarema limae has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside; the leaves are moderate in size, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a light brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry pod that splits open to release small, bean-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema limae is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily within the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. Currently, it is also found in parts of southern Bahia and northern Minas Gerais. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as understorey of tropical forests, typically at altitudes between 300 and 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Abarema limae is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abarema limae is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its attractive, velvety leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most effective method for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within two to three years, and thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abarema limae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of other plants in its vicinity. Its dense foliage also offers shelter to insects and small animals, contributing to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, Abarema limae helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
