<p>Amphilophis perforata, commonly known as the laceleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into small, intricate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens.</p>
