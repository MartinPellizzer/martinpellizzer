<p>Anathallis colnagoi, commonly known as the orchid spider plant, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence that resembles a spider's leg, bearing numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
