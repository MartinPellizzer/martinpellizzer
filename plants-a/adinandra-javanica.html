                <h1>Adinandra javanica</h1>
<p>Adinandra javanica, commonly known as the Javanian ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant features simple, opposite leaves with a smooth surface and a glossy appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>Adinandra javanica is often found in lowland forests and is known for its ecological importance in providing habitat for various species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra javanica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and are pollinated by insects; they bloom during the rainy season. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra javanica is primarily native to Jawa, Lesser Sunda Is.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the Indonesian archipelago, specifically on the island of Java. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments, often growing in the understorey of dense vegetation. Adinandra javanica is commonly associated with humid and shaded conditions, making it a characteristic species of lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Lesser Sunda Islands, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra javanica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
