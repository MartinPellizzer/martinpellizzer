                <h1>Adiantum parvifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm long, with a silvery-white underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are bi-directionally compound, with pinnae that are narrowly triangular and often recurved.</p>
<p>Adiantum parvifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum parvifolium has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, ranging from 10 to 20 cm in length, and have a light green color with a slightly bluish tinge. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching.

<p>It is often associated with temperate deciduous and coniferous forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum parvifolium was mainly introduced to moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant prefers well-drained, acidic soil and is often found in the understory of forests. It is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been noted in several regions where it has established itself in natural habitats.</p>
