                <h1>Achras hexandra</h1>
<p>Achras hexandra, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple berries. The plant belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries. Its trunk is typically smooth and gray, with a tendency to exude a milky latex when wounded.</p>
<p>The breadfruit tree is notable for its ecological and nutritional importance, providing a staple food source in many Pacific island communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras hexandra has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30-50 cm in diameter, with five to seven lobes, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces large, white or pale yellow flowers that are grouped in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, fibrous capsule that splits open to release numerous small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras hexandra is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and near riverine forests where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also known to grow in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it plays an important role in local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras hexandra was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its large, palm-like appearance. It has been introduced to various tropical regions as a decorative plant.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
