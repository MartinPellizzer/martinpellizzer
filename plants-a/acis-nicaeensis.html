                <h1>Acis nicaeensis</h1>
<p>Acis nicaeensis, commonly known as the Nicaean acis, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its botanical structure includes slender stems and narrow leaves, which help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acis nicaeensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis nicaeensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis nicaeensis is primarily native to France.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the Alpes-Maritimes and Var departments. This plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open sunny areas. It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within France.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis nicaeensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found in moist, shaded forest habitats, often near streams or in riparian zones. The plant spreads through its rhizomes, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native plant communities is still being studied.</p>
