                    <h1>Acer mono subvar. subtrifidum</h1>
<p>Acer mono subvar. subtrifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with three deeply lobed divisions, giving it a unique appearance compared to other maple species. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is typically found at high altitudes where it forms part of the montane forest ecosystem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge, and it produces samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
