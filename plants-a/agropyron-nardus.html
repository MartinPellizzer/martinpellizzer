<p>Agropyron nardus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, heathlands, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Agropyron nardus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
