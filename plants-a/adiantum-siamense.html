<p>Adiantum siamense, commonly known as the Siam maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum siamense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum siamense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a vibrant green, with a glossy surface, and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a vertical pattern. This plant does not produce flowers or fruits, as it is a spore-bearing plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum siamense is primarily native to Malaya, Thailand.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing near streams or in shaded forest understories. Adiantum siamense is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific regions within Malaya and Thailand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum siamense was mainly introduced to the wet tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to cultivated gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
