                <h1>Achillea millefolium f. rhodantha</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rhodantha, commonly known as the red-leaf yarrow, is a horticultural form of the common yarrow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which contrasts with the typical green of the species. The plant retains the characteristic feathery, fern-like leaves of Achillea millefolium but with a vibrant red hue. It produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads arranged in flat clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its visual interest and hardiness.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rhodantha has lance-shaped, finely divided leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark with a smooth texture. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale pink to white ray florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, a small, dry, one-seeded achene, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rhodantha is a variant of the common yarrow, native to parts of Europe, including the British Isles, southern Scandinavia, and western Russia.</p>
<p>While it originally occurred in these regions, its current distribution has expanded to include parts of North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often growing in well-drained soils. It is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its conservation status is generally stable due to its adaptability and widespread occurrence.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rhodantha is a striking perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune faded flower heads to encourage continuous blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
