<p>Anatherum tripsacoides, commonly known as wild maize or triploid millet, is a grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its seeds are small and oval, with a hard coat that aids in dormancy.</p>
<p>Anatherum tripsacoides is closely related to cultivated maize and has been studied for its potential in agriculture and conservation.</p>
