                <h1>Acineta salazarii</h1>
<p>Acineta salazarii, commonly known as the Salazarii acineta, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta salazarii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. It produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it bursts open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta salazarii is primarily native to El Salvador, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Acineta salazarii is adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta salazarii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions where its native range has been altered by land use changes. The plant thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, sometimes competing with native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and urban landscapes.</p>
