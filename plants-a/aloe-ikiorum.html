                    <h1>Aloe ikiorum</h1>
<p>Aloe ikiorum, commonly known as the Desert Aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb rainwater efficiently.</p>
<p>Aloe ikiorum is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
