<p>Aconitum zhaojiueense, commonly known as Zhaojiue aconite, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant produces smooth, ovate leaves with a hairy underside, and its roots are tuberous and fleshy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum zhaojiueense has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>

<p>Aconitum zhaojiueense is primarily native to China, specifically the Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, where the climate is temperate and humid. This plant thrives in forested areas and rocky slopes, often at higher altitudes. Its native distribution is limited to these specific ecological conditions in Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum zhaojiueense was mainly introduced to China, where it has been documented in several provinces, particularly in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
