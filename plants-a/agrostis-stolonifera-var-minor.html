                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. minor</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. minor, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes and ecological restoration projects.</p>
