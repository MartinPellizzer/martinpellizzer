                <h1>Acourtia patens</h1>
<p>Acourtia patens, commonly known as the coast mallow, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acourtia patens plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia patens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a prostrate or ascending pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for nutrient absorption in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia patens is primarily native to Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these geographic areas. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and scrublands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions in Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia patens was mainly introduced to disturbed areas and coastal environments due to its adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it common along shorelines and dunes. This plant is often found in regions with moderate to high exposure to wind and sun. Its introduction has led to its spread in coastal ecosystems, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it disrupts local flora and fauna.</p>
