                <h1>Adyseton alpestre</h1>
<p>Adyseton alpestre, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Adyseton alpestre is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton alpestre has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size of about 5-8 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky and well-drained soils of its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton alpestre is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. It is well adapted to the cold and dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adyseton alpestre is a rare and endemic species, with a limited geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton alpestre was mainly introduced to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. This plant is often associated with alpine meadows and open slopes. Its introduction has been linked to human activity, including horticultural interest and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
