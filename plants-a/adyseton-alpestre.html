                    <h1>Adyseton alpestre</h1>
<p>Adyseton alpestre, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Adyseton alpestre is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
