                    <h1>Androsace maxima</h1>
<p>Androsace maxima, commonly known as the giant rock jasmine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. Its leaves are usually oval or heart-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Androsace maxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas.</p>
