<p>Agrostemma githago f. exilis, commonly known as the slender goatweed, is a variant of the common goatweed, characterized by its more delicate and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Papaveraceae, known for its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other members of the genus.</p>
<p>The species is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
