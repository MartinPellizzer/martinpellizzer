                <h1>Adenophaedra minor</h1>
<p>Adenophaedra minor, commonly known as the lesser adenophaedra, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Adenophaedra minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra minor has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in fine hairs, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra minor is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in areas with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with coniferous forests and is a characteristic component of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra minor was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
