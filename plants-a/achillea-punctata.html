<p>Achillea punctata, commonly known as the spotted yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves with white markings. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea punctata has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a basal rosette and reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
