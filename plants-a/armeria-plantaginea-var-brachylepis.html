                    <h1>Armeria plantaginea var. brachylepis</h1>
<p>Armeria plantaginea var. brachylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, contributing to its compact and tidy appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
