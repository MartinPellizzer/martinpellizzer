<p>Agelanthus natalitius subsp.</p>
<p>natalitius, commonly known as Natal's agelanthus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
