<p>Arthrostylis kennyi, commonly known as the Kenny's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Arthrostylis kennyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
