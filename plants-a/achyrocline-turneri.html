                <h1>Achyrocline turneri</h1>
<p>Achyrocline turneri, commonly known as the Mexican blue sage, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Achyrocline turneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline turneri has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, ranging in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, light green to grayish bark, growing in a spreading shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are typically pink to violet in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline turneri is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Costa Rica and Panama. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal areas or on limestone soils. It is commonly associated with dry to moist forests and is often found in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline turneri was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. This plant has been reported in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction is believed to be due to human activities, including accidental transport through shipping or gardening.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
