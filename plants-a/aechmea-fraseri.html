<p>Aechmea fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the subtropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's foliage is typically vibrant green with a bluish or purple tinge, and it produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea fraseri is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
