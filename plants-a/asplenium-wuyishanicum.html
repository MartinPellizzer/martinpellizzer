                    <h1>Asplenium wuyishanicum</h1>
<p>Asplenium wuyishanicum, commonly known as the Wuyi spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the mountainous regions of Fujian Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices of cliffs. Its small, spore-bearing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
