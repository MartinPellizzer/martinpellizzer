<p>Androcymbium psammophilum, commonly known as the sand dune cymbium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Androcymbium psammophilum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert fauna.</p>
