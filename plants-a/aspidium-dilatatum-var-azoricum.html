                    <h1>Aspidium dilatatum var. azoricum</h1>
<p>Aspidium dilatatum var. azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to the Azores.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats. Its rhizomes are often rooted in the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and can vary in shape depending on the water conditions and light exposure.</p>
