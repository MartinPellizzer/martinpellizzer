                <h1>Acinodendron puberulum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron puberulum, commonly known as the hairy acinodendron, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often producing a fragrant scent to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron puberulum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dull green color and a hairy texture on both surfaces.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron puberulum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Malayan biodiversity hotspot.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron puberulum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering during the growing season. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural ecosystems, sometimes competing with native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in disturbed areas and agricultural fields.</p>
