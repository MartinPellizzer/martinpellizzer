                <h1>Acinodendron denticulatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed acinodendron, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a variety of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with finely toothed margins. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release its seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron denticulatum has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge and an alternate arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it thrive in dry, rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron denticulatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands and savanna habitats. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate. It is often associated with rocky or limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within eastern and southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron denticulatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with warm climates and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can establish itself rapidly. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
