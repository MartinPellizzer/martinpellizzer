                    <h1>Atylus trilobus</h1>
<p>Atylus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, inflated bladders used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils and water bodies, where it absorbs nutrients from captured organisms. Its leaves are simple and lack true roots, while its flowers are small and often pale in color.</p>
<p>Atylus trilobus is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
