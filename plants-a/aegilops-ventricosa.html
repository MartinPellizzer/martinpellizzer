                <h1>Aegilops ventricosa</h1>
<p>Aegilops ventricosa, commonly known as the spikelet grass or woolly wild oat, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae).</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of Eurasia and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy seed heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its inflorescence consists of compact spikelets, and the leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>Aegilops ventricosa is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops ventricosa has leaves that are narrow, grass-like in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a somewhat spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to purple florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
