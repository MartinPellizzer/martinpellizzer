<p>Aechmea ampla, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, known as a rosette, which collects water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with prominent white or silver veins, and they are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. Aechmea ampla produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal.</p>
