                <h1>Adolia alba</h1>
<p>Adolia alba, commonly known as the white adolia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Adolia alba is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolia alba has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a pale green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind due to their lack of showy petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia alba is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. This plant is commonly found in tropical rainforests and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is also cultivated in some botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia alba was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It has established populations in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its successful spread.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources.</p>
