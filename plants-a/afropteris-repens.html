<p>Afropteris repens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a terrestrial fern native to parts of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Afropteris repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
