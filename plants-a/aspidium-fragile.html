<p>Aspidium fragile, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often frayed fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and creeping, with numerous roots that help anchor it in soil or substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
