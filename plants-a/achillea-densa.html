                <h1>Achillea densa</h1>
<p>Achillea densa, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. It grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm and blooms from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Achillea densa is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea densa has basal leaves that are lanceolate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette formation and ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, with a slightly rough texture and grows in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea densa is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of northern Africa, southern Europe, and western Asia, often in disturbed or rocky habitats. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a species of interest for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea densa is a hardy perennial plant known for its dense, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea densa involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, with dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea densa is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on it for food and shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, stabilizing soil in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea densa contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and sustenance to various ecological organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea densa is a perennial flowering plant known for its aromatic foliage and yellow flowers, which have been utilized in various ways throughout history.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its leaves and flowers can be used to flavor teas and herbal infusions, adding a subtle, earthy aroma.
