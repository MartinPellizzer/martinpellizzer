                    <h1>Aridaria straminea</h1>
<p>Aridaria straminea, commonly known as the desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing minimal forage for desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in dry landscapes.</p>
