                    <h1>Aechmea minor</h1>
<p>Aechmea minor, commonly known as the small pineapple bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces a striking flower spike that can bear multiple blooms, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea minor is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
