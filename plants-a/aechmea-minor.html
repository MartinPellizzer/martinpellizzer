                <h1>Aechmea minor</h1>
<p>Aechmea minor, commonly known as the small pineapple bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces a striking flower spike that can bear multiple blooms, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea minor is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea minor has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and covered with fine hairs, arranged in a tight spiral around the plantâ€™s central axis.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green, with a waxy coating, and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, fibrous stem that is often hidden beneath the leaf rosette, with a pale greenish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly rough to the touch. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, featuring bright red bracts that enclose small, yellowish flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds.</p>
<p>The plant produces a fleshy, berry-like fruit that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds consuming the fruit.</p>
