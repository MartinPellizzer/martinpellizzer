<p>Aristaria, commonly known as the false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences, which consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aristaria species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They have rhizomatous growth habits, allowing them to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
