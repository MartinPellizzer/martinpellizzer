<p>Anthericum saltii, commonly known as the salt marsh anthericum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to greenish flowers. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Anthericum saltii is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens.</p>
