<p>Agave potreriana, commonly known as the Chihuahua agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are lined with sharp spines. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green inflorescences, which are often used in traditional ceremonies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Agave potreriana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its fibers and as a source of nectar.</p>
