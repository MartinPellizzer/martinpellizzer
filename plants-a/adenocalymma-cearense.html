                <h1>Adenocalymma cearense</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma cearense, commonly known as the Ceará adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna regions.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma cearense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cearense has leaves that are simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cearense is primarily native to northeastern Brazil, specifically the state of Ceará.</p>
<p>It is found in the semi-arid region of the country, where it adapts to the harsh environmental conditions. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with shrublands and dry forests. It is well-suited to the low rainfall and high temperatures characteristic of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cearense was mainly introduced to the Neotropical region, particularly in parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Brazil, especially in the states of Ceará and Piauí. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and dry scrublands. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
