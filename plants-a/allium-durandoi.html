<p>Allium durandoi, commonly known as the Durango garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
