                <h1>Adina asperula</h1>
<p>Adina asperula, commonly known as roughleaf adina, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adina asperula is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina asperula has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are woody and have a rough, bark-like texture, typically appearing reddish-brown in color, and they grow upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina asperula is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of Colombia and Ecuador. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of tropical forests. It is also present in some islands of the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with humid climates and is often found near rivers and in lowland areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina asperula was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as gardening, landscaping, and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open areas. This plant has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its spread, it is often monitored for potential ecological impacts.</p>
