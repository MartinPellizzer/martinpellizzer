                <h1>Adenia schlechteri</h1>
<p>Adenia schlechteri, commonly known as the African mountain hibiscus, is a shrub native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Adenia schlechteri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia schlechteri has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically arranged along the stems.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are large, showy, and have five petals, typically pink to red in color, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia schlechteri is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with coastal and inland forest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within the broader Malesian flora area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia schlechteri was mainly introduced to the eastern and northern regions of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland rainforest areas, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is typically associated with shaded environments and is often seen as an understorey species. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cultivated gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
