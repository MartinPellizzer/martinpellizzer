                        <h1>Acacia profusa</h1>
<p>Acacia profusa, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Acacia profusa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
