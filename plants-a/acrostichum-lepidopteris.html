                <h1>Acrostichum lepidopteris</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lepidopteris, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Davalliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests and swamps. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
<p>The fronds are compound, with multiple pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, elegant pattern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepidopteris has large, broad, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a clump-like pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in wet, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepidopteris is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland environments, often found near rivers and in swampy areas. This fern is commonly associated with wetlands and mangrove swamps, where it can tolerate high levels of salinity. Its distribution extends from southern Mexico through the Caribbean islands to northern South America.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to coastal and estuarine habitats, making it an important component of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepidopteris was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites where it can thrive in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial shade, making it suitable for wetlands and riverbanks. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
