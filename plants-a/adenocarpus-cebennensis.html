                <h1>Adenocarpus cebennensis</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus cebennensis, commonly known as the Cebenna burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the legume or pea family. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus cebennensis has alternate, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus cebennensis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open grasslands and coastal areas. It is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus cebennensis is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus cebennensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and disturbed soils, often along roadsides and in agricultural areas. The plant is known for its small, yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in dry conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stabilization.</p>
