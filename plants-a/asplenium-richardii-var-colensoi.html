                    <h1>Asplenium richardii var. colensoi</h1>
<p>Asplenium richardii var. colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green, and often arching fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
