                    <h1>Aulomyrcia pallens var. ovata</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia pallens var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leafed alderleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myricaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or yellowish in color, which develop into woody, cone-like structures. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swampy or riparian areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its ovate leaf shape, which sets it apart from the typical form of Aulomyrcia pallens.</p>
