                    <h1>Asclepias denticulata</h1>
<p>Asclepias denticulata, commonly known as the toothleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, toothed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but serves as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Asclepias denticulata plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and host plant for their larvae.</p>
