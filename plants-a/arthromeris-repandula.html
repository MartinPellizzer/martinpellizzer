                    <h1>Arthromeris repandula</h1>
<p>Arthromeris repandula, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in waterlogged or saturated conditions.</p>
<p>Arthromeris repandula plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is often found in association with other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants.</p>
