<p>Aliciella haydenii subsp.</p>
<p>crandallii, commonly known as the Crandall's alicia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It is often found in association with other xerophytic species, growing in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native range.</p>
