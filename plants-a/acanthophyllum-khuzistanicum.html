                        <h1>Acanthophyllum khuzistanicum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum khuzistanicum, commonly known as the Khuzistan spiny herb, is a flowering plant native to Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing features typical of xerophytes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or reddish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum khuzistanicum is primarily native to the southwestern regions of Iran, particularly in the Khuzestan Province.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. This plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including high temperatures and limited rainfall. It is commonly found in desert steppes and along the edges of saline lakes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with specific ecological niches that support its survival in these extreme environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum khuzistanicum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Asia, particularly in Iran and parts of Pakistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils with low precipitation. This plant is commonly found in desert and steppe environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its introduction has been documented in ecological studies focusing on plant adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its potential in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
