                    <h1>Athyrium × pichisermollianum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × pichisermollianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filipendulineum and Athyrium pichisermollianum.</p>
<p>It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including delicate fronds with a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing fronds are usually produced in late summer, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
