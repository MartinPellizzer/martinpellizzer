                <h1>Acronia dibolia</h1>
<p>Acronia dibolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Acronia dibolia has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia dibolia has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem, with a glossy dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that develops fissures as the plant matures, and it grows in a creeping pattern along the ground. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia dibolia is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, specifically Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. The plant is commonly found in the understory of primary forests, where it benefits from the dense canopy cover. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological niches due to its particular climatic and soil requirements.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia dibolia was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and nutrient-rich soil, often found near tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, moist climates and is commonly found in regions with dense vegetation. The plant has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its rapid growth and ability to adapt to various soil types have made it a concern in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and medicinal properties.</p>
