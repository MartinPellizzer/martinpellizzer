<p>Aira setacea, commonly known as the tufted aira, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pale brown, bract-like structures that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Aira setacea is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
