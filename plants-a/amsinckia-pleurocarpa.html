<p>Amsinckia pleurocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Amsinckia pleurocarpa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions.</p>
