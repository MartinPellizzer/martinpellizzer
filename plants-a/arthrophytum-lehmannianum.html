                    <h1>Arthrophytum lehmannianum</h1>
<p>Arthrophytum lehmannianum, commonly known as the Lehmann's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in xeriscapes.</p>
