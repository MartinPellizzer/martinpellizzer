                <h1>Aellenia subaphylla</h1>
<p>Aellenia subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Aellenia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, pale flowers are often clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its unique morphological features that distinguish it from closely related species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aellenia subaphylla is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aellenia subaphylla has small, narrow leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
