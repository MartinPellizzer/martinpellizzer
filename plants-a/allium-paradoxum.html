                    <h1>Allium paradoxum</h1>
<p>Allium paradoxum, commonly known as the paradox onion, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a strong, pungent odor similar to that of garlic and onions, which is due to sulfur-containing compounds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulb is typically small and rounded.</p>
<p>Allium paradoxum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
