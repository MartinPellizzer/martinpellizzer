                <h1>Achillea clavennae f. velebitica</h1>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit yarrow, is a perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. velebitica has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale yellowish bark that remains smooth throughout its growth. The flowers are small, composite yellow blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus, which facilitates wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. velebitica is a rare subspecies native to the Dinaric Alps, specifically found in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Velebit Mountains. This plant thrives in rocky, dry, and sunny environments, typically growing on slopes and cliffs. It is found at altitudes ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. velebitica is a compact, drought-tolerant perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late winter. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like thyme or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. velebitica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in meadows, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its dense growth habit. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of its habitat by supporting a network of interdependent species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. velebitica is a lesser-known variant of the yarrow plant, primarily found in specific regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it shares some properties with other yarrow species and may be used in traditional herbal infusions. In medicinal contexts, it may have potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it may contribute to local biodiversity and ecological stability in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in local traditions, though its significance is not well documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. velebitica has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aurea' and 'Paprika', which display striking yellow and orange flower heads respectively.</p>
<p>While it is primarily a natural form rather than a cultivated hybrid, it has been used in crosses with other Achillea species to develop new hybrids that enhance garden diversity. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and extended bloom periods, making them more adaptable to various garden conditions. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to add color and texture to rock gardens and borders, especially in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience contribute to its popularity among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, decorative plants.</p>
