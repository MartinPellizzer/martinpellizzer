                <h1>Acer truncatum var. pilosum</h1>
<p>Acer truncatum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in soft, hairy pubescence, especially on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>The hairy maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum var. pilosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a finely toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length; they are dark green on top and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum var. pilosum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The species is considered endangered, with very few mature individuals remaining in the wild.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique and threatened plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum var. pilosum is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum var. pilosum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for insects and other small creatures.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum var. pilosum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits, though some traditional communities may use its leaves in minor herbal preparations.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, with studies suggesting possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though more research is needed. In terms of industrial applications, it is not widely used, but its wood may have niche applications in small-scale crafts or local economies. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions where it is admired for its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely ecological and ornamental, contributing to biodiversity and local landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer truncatum var. pilosum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, such as 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum'.</p>
<p>These cultivars are known for their striking yellow or variegated leaves that add visual interest to gardens. Hybrids of this species are often created to enhance traits like cold hardiness and leaf coloration, making them more adaptable to different climates. Due to their aesthetic appeal, Acer truncatum var. pilosum and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance in landscape design.</p>
<p>They are frequently used in shaded gardens and as specimen plants, contributing to biodiversity in cultivated plant collections.</p>
