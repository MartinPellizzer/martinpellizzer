                    <h1>Alisma superbum var. angustissimum</h1>
<p>Alisma superbum var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland vegetation structure.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
