                    <h1>Abies cilicica</h1>
<p>Abies cilicica, commonly known as the Eastern Caucasian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown, with needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces cones that are typically 5â€“8 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in mixed forests with other conifers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
