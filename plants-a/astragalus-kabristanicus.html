                    <h1>Astragalus kabristanicus</h1>
<p>Astragalus kabristanicus, commonly known as the Kabristan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
