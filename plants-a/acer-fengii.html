                <h1>Acer fengii</h1>
<p>Acer fengii, commonly known as the Fengyi maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and landscaped areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fengii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a bright green color during the growing season and a striking red or orange hue in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and straight, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in upright panicles, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind as the seeds are carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fengii is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and scattered, with only a few known populations remaining. It thrives in humid, temperate environments, often growing in shaded, moist forest understories. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural regeneration, Acer fengii is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fengii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer fengii is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and foliage turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with organic pesticides.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fengii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer fengii plays a role in carbon sequestration, improving air quality and supporting overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fengii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, its sap may have potential for local use in traditional practices. In terms of medicinal applications, it has been explored for its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and paper industries in regions where it is cultivated.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in Chinese botanical traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fengii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Pendulum' and 'Gumpo,' which are known for their striking foliage and distinctive growth forms. Hybrids of Acer fengii are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness, disease resistance, and color variation. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, especially in gardens and landscapes where they add visual interest and diversity.</p>
<p>Their popularity underscores the plant's importance in both traditional and modern garden design.</p>
