                <h1>Acer fengii</h1>
<p>Acer fengii, commonly known as the Fengshan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to develop shallow fissures as it matures.</p>
<p>Acer fengii prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fengii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning bright red or orange in the autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellow-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, providing stability and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fengii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it grows in moist, shaded forest understories. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate forests. Acer fengii is found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fengii is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The growth cycle of Acer fengii involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormancy phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fengii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. Its deep root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in mountainous regions. The tree also serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving soil quality and offering aesthetic value to the landscape.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fengii is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in traditional medicine, its wood is sometimes utilized in small-scale woodworking due to its fine grain and durability. The plant holds cultural significance in certain regions of China, where it is admired for its unique leaf patterns and is occasionally featured in artistic and symbolic contexts. Although it does not play a major role in industrial or economic sectors, its presence contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer fengii's primary value lies in its aesthetic and ecological contributions rather than in direct human applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fengii has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is primarily known for its unique ornamental value rather than extensive cultivar development.</p>
<p>Among the popular cultivars, 'Himalayan Flame' and 'Crimson Crown' stand out for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids involving Acer fengii are rare due to its specific genetic makeup and limited crossability with other maple species. Despite this, it holds horticultural importance as a rare and striking addition to gardens and landscapes, particularly in regions with suitable climates.</p>
<p>Its distinct foliage and slow growth make it a sought-after specimen for collectors and landscape designers.</p>
