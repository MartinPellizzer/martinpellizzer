                <h1>Aconitum anthora var. gilvum</h1>
<p>Aconitum anthora var. gilvum, commonly known as the yellow alpine monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which are clustered in a helmet-like shape at the top of tall, spindly stems. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or yellowish down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthora var. gilvum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem, with a broad, spreading shape and a size ranging from 10 to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a dark purple to brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat branched pattern. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthora var. gilvum is a rare variant of the European aconite, native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in countries like Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific alpine and subalpine areas, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. This plant typically grows in open meadows, rocky slopes, and streamside habitats at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is classified as critically endangered in several regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthora var. gilvum is a striking perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and robust growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing foliage in the first year and flowering in the second before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its aesthetic appeal in shaded gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthora var. gilvum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its vibrant yellow flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. The plant also plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion due to its deep root system.</p>
