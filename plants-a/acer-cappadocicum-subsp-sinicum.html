                <h1>Acer cappadocicum subsp. sinicum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>sinicum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>sinicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>sinicum is a rare maple species native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Japan and Korea, though its current distribution remains restricted.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often found in mixed forests. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a critically endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>sinicum is a slow-growing ornamental tree known for its distinctive red bark and small, yellowish leaves. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is mainly done to shape the tree and remove dead or damaged branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can help repel pests and improve the overall garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>sinicum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and improving water retention.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>sinicum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies for its purported medicinal properties. It has potential industrial applications due to its wood, which is valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and decorative items.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions of China, where it is associated with resilience and longevity. While not widely used in modern economies, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>
<p>Its role in traditional medicine and ornamental horticulture highlights its importance in both cultural and ecological contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>sinicum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Coral Bark', which are prized for their striking autumn color and unique bark. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to the development of ornamental hybrids like 'Autumn Blaze' and 'Emerald Queen'.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and improved color display, making them more adaptable to a range of climates. The horticultural importance of this subspecies lies in its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids are widely used in landscaping and gardens for their visual appeal and resilience.</p>
