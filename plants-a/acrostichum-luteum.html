                <h1>Acrostichum luteum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum luteum, commonly known as the yellow hibiscus, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, sunny environments and is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum luteum has large, leathery, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright yellow-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it spread and anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum luteum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and abundant moisture, often growing in dense stands. Its distribution extends into parts of the Caribbean as well.</p>
<p>Acrostichum luteum is an important component of the riparian and wetland ecosystems in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum luteum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found along shorelines and in estuaries. This plant is commonly established in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through rhizomes. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native vegetation and ecosystem balance.</p>
