                    <h1>Adenanthera aculeata</h1>
<p>Adenanthera aculeata, commonly known as the African burr or sour fig, is a leguminous shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spiny, woody pods. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agroforestry systems. Its seeds are edible but have a bitter taste and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant's thorny structure and rapid growth make it both a useful and sometimes problematic species in its native habitats.</p>
