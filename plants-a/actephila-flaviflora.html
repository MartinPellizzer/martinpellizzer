                <h1>Actephila flaviflora</h1>
<p>Actephila flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered actephila, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Actephila flaviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila flaviflora has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on environmental conditions. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a prominent white or pale yellow center, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila flaviflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing near streams or in shaded understory environments. Its distribution extends into parts of India and the western Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila flaviflora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and full to partial sunlight. This plant is often found in regions where its native range has been expanded through human activity. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in these new environments.</p>
