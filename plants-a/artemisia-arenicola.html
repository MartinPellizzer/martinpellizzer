<p>Artemisia arenicola, commonly known as sand artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, minty scent and provide some degree of pest resistance.</p>
<p>Artemisia arenicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native environment.</p>
