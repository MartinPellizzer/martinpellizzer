                <h1>Adinandra caudata</h1>
<p>Adinandra caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed adinandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite leaves that are usually elliptic in shape. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries as its fruit.</p>
<p>Adinandra caudata is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra caudata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor itself in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra caudata is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Borneo and the islands of Sumatra and Java. It thrives in tropical rainforests, often growing in the understory where it receives partial shade. Adinandra caudata is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and deforestation, it is listed as a vulnerable species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra caudata is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within several years, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
