                <h1>Adinandra caudata</h1>
<p>Adinandra caudata, commonly known as the hairy tamarind, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody shrub or small tree form, with smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often hairy, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Adinandra caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra caudata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra caudata is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within Vietnam's biodiversity-rich landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra caudata was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for regions with high rainfall. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several countries as a garden plant and for ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some non-native habitats.</p>
