                        <h1>Acaena argentea f. viridis</h1>
<p>Acaena argentea f. viridis, commonly known as the green burr bush, is a variant of the silver burr bush native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces spherical, spiky fruits that are typically green in this form, distinguishing it from the more commonly known silver-furred variety. It thrives in coastal and disturbed soils, often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena argentea f. viridis is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in temperate grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with well-drained soils. It thrives in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to the climate conditions of these regions. The species is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its silver-green foliage.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its historical distribution across the southern cone of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena argentea f. viridis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal threat to native ecosystems.</p>
