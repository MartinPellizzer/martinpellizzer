                <h1>Acrothamnus suaveolens</h1>
<p>Acrothamnus suaveolens, commonly known as sweet wattle, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus suaveolens has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring 3â€“7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures, and they grow in a sprawling or shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in spikes, with pale yellow to cream petals, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus suaveolens is primarily native to Borneo, Lesser Sunda Is., New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon Is., and Sulawesi.</p>
<p>This shrub is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in coastal and lowland environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus suaveolens was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, dunes, and abandoned fields. This plant spreads through its extensive root system and can form dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent further erosion. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been documented in several parts of Australia, including New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
