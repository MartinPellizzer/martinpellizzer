                    <h1>Agave oblongata</h1>
<p>Agave oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are narrow and pointed, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem.</p>
<p>Agave oblongata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
