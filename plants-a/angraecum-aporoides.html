                    <h1>Angraecum aporoides</h1>
<p>Angraecum aporoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers and long, slender stems that often hang from trees. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. Its flowers bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators like hawk moths.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts.</p>
