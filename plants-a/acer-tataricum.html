                <h1>Acer tataricum</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum, commonly known as the Tatarian maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn bright yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length, with a doubly serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated and lack showy petals. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum is a small deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Korea, and Russia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of Europe and North America, where it has been introduced as an ornamental species. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or along stream banks. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered threatened in its native range, it is sometimes listed as a species of concern in areas where it has been heavily planted or where habitat degradation occurs.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum is a deciduous shrub or small tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with hardwood cuttings being the most reliable method. The growth cycle of Acer tataricum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in the spring. Its dense growth acts as a natural erosion control plant, helping to stabilize soil along riverbanks and slopes. The plant also serves as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, its leaves contribute to nutrient cycling in the ecosystem, supporting overall biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its edible fruits can be used to make jams and syrups, adding a unique flavor to various dishes. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties, often in herbal remedies. Industrially, its wood is valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and renewal, often featured in local traditions and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum has several popular cultivars such as 'Sutherlandii' and 'Flame Sunset', which are prized for their striking foliage colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also has natural hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the genus. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes. Their adaptability to various climates makes them valuable additions to both residential and public spaces.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer tataricum plays a significant role in the horticultural industry due to its aesthetic appeal and versatility.</p>
