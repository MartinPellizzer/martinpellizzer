<p>Achillea foeniculacea, commonly known as sweet fern, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a pleasant, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea foeniculacea has compound, pinnatifid leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and somewhat woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
