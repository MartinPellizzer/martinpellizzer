                <h1>Adelocaryum coelestinum</h1>
<p>Adelocaryum coelestinum, commonly known as the blue star, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which give it its common name. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adelocaryum coelestinum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum coelestinum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring blue-violet petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum coelestinum is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with forested areas and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution within India is largely limited to specific ecological niches that support its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum coelestinum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in areas with moderate moisture and partial shade. The plant's ability to spread via seeds carried by wind and water has contributed to its establishment in non-native regions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains localized compared to other more aggressive invasive plants.</p>
