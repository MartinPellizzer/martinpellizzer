<p>Arabis hirsuta var. allionii, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are densely covered with white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
