                <h1>Adenocalymma splendens</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma splendens, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma splendens thrives in warm, moist conditions and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma splendens has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma splendens is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the regions of the Eastern Cape, Free State, and KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky outcrops, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma splendens is a perennial shrub that thrives in full sun and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma splendens was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and sandy soils. This plant is known for its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It has become naturalized in certain areas, posing a potential threat to native plant communities.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging invasive species to control.</p>
