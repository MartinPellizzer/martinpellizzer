<p>Abies delavayi var. motuoensis, commonly known as the Motuo fir, is a rare and endemic conifer found in the high-altitude regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
