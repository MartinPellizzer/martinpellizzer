                    <h1>Avena sativa var. erythrosperma</h1>
<p>Avena sativa var. erythrosperma, commonly known as red-spored oat, is a variant of the oat species characterized by its distinctive red-colored seeds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, leafy stems and panicles of spikelets. Its seeds are smaller and more densely packed compared to standard oat varieties, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>The red coloration of the seeds is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also provide antioxidant properties.</p>
