                    <h1>Agrostis sibirica</h1>
<p>Agrostis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in cooler climates.</p>
