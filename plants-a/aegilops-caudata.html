                <h1>Aegilops caudata</h1>
<p>Aegilops caudata, commonly known as the goatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Aegilops caudata is also of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops caudata has elongated, grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly curled at the edges, with a bluish-green color and a flat arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and somewhat hairy, with a light green color and grows upright with a clumping growth pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind, with each seed having a thin, papery coat.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
