                <h1>Acianthera calopedilon</h1>
<p>Acianthera calopedilon, commonly known as the spotted leaching orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive red or purple spots. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often epiphytic on trees. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera calopedilon has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera calopedilon is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. The plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera calopedilon was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soil, often found in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to its spread in some regions, where it may compete with native flora.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
