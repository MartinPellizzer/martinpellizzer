<p>Aegilops procera, commonly known as the tall wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. Aegilops procera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential in agricultural and ecological applications due to its hardy nature and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops procera has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets, blooming in early summer and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-angled, dehiscent capsule that releases small, smooth seeds through mechanical means.</p>
