                <h1>Actinella bigelovii</h1>
<p>Actinella bigelovii, commonly known as the Bigelow's actinella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its showy yellow to orange flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bract-like structures around its flowers.</p>
<p>Actinella bigelovii is often found in open areas such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella bigelovii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually green and have a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture, growing upright and branching from the base. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella bigelovii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in regions of California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, dry habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and talus areas. This plant thrives in environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with chaparral and woodland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella bigelovii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, gravel bars, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soils, making it common in arid and semi-arid regions. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in states like Nevada, California, and Utah. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native plant communities, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and reproductive strategies, it has become a persistent weed in many disturbed areas.</p>
