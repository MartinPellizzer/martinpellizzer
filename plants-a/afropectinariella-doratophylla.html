                    <h1>Afropectinariella doratophylla</h1>
<p>Afropectinariella doratophylla, commonly known as the African moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense, and often greenish-yellow thallus, which is typically found growing on rocky or sandy substrates in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant exhibits a complex structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are arranged in a tight, cushion-like formation. Afropectinariella doratophylla is adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low moisture levels.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health in its native regions.</p>
