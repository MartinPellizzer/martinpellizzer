<p>Acanthopanax nipponicus, commonly known as Japanese angel's trumpet, is a climbing shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with serrated margins and produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its milky latex sap and woody stems that often have thorns. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax nipponicus has compound leaves that are pinnate, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length. The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern with branching. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by birds and through seed predation.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
