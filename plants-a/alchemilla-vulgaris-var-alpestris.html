                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose, branched clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Alpestris is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental foliage.</p>
