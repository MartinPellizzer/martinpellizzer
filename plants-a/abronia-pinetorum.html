                        <h1>Abronia pinetorum</h1>
<p>Abronia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest bluet, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine forests and hardwood hammocks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>Abronia pinetorum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia pinetorum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils within coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. This plant thrives in areas with high salinity and is often associated with disturbed or open habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia pinetorum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread to parts of Washington and California, often found in disturbed soils near human settlements. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly seen in forested areas.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and is considered a minor component of local flora.</p>
