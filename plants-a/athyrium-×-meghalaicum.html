                    <h1>Athyrium × meghalaicum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × meghalaicum, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which helps anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
