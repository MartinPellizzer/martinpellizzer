                    <h1>Angraecopsis gassneri</h1>
<p>Angraecopsis gassneri, commonly known as the Gassner's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick leaves that store water and a deep root system for drought tolerance. Its flowers emit a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
