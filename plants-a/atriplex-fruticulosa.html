                    <h1>Atriplex fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Atriplex fruticulosa, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex fruticulosa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
