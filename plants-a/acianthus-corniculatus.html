                <h1>Acianthus corniculatus</h1>
<p>Acianthus corniculatus, commonly known as the horned violet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are usually purple or violet in color, and it produces small, round seed pods that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Acianthus corniculatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus corniculatus has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and have a pale yellow color with a distinctive spurred structure, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus corniculatus is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous regions and along coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with the fynbos vegetation type, which is characteristic of the Cape Floristic Region. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with periods of drought and seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>Acianthus corniculatus is also occasionally found in parts of southeastern Africa, such as Mozambique and Zimbabwe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus corniculatus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in wetland and riparian areas. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its population and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
