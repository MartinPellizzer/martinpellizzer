<p>Aloidendron dichotomum, commonly known as the mountain aloes, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear orange-red flowers, which are borne in clusters. It is a member of the Asphodelaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
