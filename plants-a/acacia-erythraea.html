                        <h1>Acacia erythraea</h1>
<p>Acacia erythraea, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in woody pods and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia erythraea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia erythraea is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, including parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shorelines. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dunes or on rocky terrain. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia erythraea is also known for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it well adapted to coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia erythraea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been widely planted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in agricultural areas and along roadsides, where it serves as a windbreak and soil stabilizer. Despite its benefits, it has also become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its rapid spread and potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptability has made it a popular choice for reforestation and land rehabilitation projects.</p>
