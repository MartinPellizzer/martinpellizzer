                    <h1>Aegilops variabilis var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Aegilops variabilis var. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous颖果 (glumes) that enclose the seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in cultivated barley varieties.</p>
