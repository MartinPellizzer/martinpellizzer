<p>Aeollanthus repens, commonly known as the creeping aeollanthus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Aeollanthus repens is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a minor role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local insect populations.</p>
