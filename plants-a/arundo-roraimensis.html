                    <h1>Arundo roraimensis</h1>
<p>Arundo roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous growth and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense colonies that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The leaves are long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
