                            <h1>Aquilaria Parvifolia</h1>
<p>Aquilaria parvifolia is a rare and ancient tree species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Known for its unique ability to produce a valuable resin called agarwood, it holds significant cultural and economic importance. This plant is often found in dense forests where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its fragrant wood is highly sought after in traditional medicine and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Aquilaria parvifolia is now critically endangered, prompting urgent conservation efforts.</p>
