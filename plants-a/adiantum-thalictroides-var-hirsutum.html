                    <h1>Adiantum thalictroides var. hirsutum</h1>
<p>Adiantum thalictroides var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy trichomes, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
