                            <h1>Aureolaria Grandiflora Subsp. Serrata</h1>
<p>Serrated aureolaria, scientifically known as Aureolaria grandiflora subsp. serrata, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. This species is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and clusters of showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland understories or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
