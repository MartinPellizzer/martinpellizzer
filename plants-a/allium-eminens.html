                    <h1>Allium eminens</h1>
<p>Allium eminens, commonly known as the giant garlic, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, topped with a dense cluster of white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, round bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but are not typically used for culinary purposes. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often bluish-green in color, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Allium eminens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
