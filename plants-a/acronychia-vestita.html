                <h1>Acronychia vestita</h1>
<p>Acronychia vestita, commonly known as the velvet-leafed acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically yellow or orange and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, making it an important species for both ecological and botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia vestita has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming from September to November, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release black,椭圆形 seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia vestita is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state, particularly in rainforest and coastal areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soils. It is often seen in the understorey of dense forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Queensland, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia vestita was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and urban areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is often used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate saline conditions. However, it has also become naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to the eastern coastal regions of Australia.</p>
