<p>Asplenium lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant's spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered at the base of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
