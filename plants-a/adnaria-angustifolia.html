                <h1>Adnaria angustifolia</h1>
<p>Adnaria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are blue or purple in color.</p>
<p>Adnaria angustifolia is often found in maritime environments and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria angustifolia has narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, blooming in spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread shallowly through the soil, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria angustifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the eastern and southern coasts of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as Greece, Turkey, and parts of the Levant. This plant typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, often on cliffs or along shorelines. It thrives in saline and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to the harsh coastal climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soils and exposure to sea breezes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria angustifolia was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in southern Europe and the eastern Atlantic.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, brackish waters and has been found along the coasts of Spain, France, and Italy. The plant is often associated with human activities, such as ballast water discharge and aquaculture, which have facilitated its spread. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact is still being studied due to limited long-term data.</p>
