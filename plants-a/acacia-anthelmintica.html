                        <h1>Acacia anthelmintica</h1>
<p>Acacia anthelmintica, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with traditional medicinal uses, including antiparasitic properties.</p>
<p>Acacia anthelmintica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia anthelmintica is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, including countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This plant thrives in dry climates with minimal rainfall, making it well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen in coastal dunes and sandy plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is also occasionally found in parts of the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia anthelmintica was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide forage for livestock in semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil quality. The plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands and supporting local agriculture.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent its spread into non-target areas.</p>
