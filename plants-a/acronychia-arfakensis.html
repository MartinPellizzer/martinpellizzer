                <h1>Acronychia arfakensis</h1>
<p>Acronychia arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia arfakensis has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branched structure. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its native soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia arfakensis is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is typically found in lowland and hill forest regions, growing as a small to medium-sized tree. The plant's distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Guinea, where it thrives in the warm and moist climate.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia arfakensis was mainly introduced to the data as a new species discovered in the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It was first documented by botanists during a regional flora survey in the early 2000s. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, clustered flowers. It is believed to have been previously overlooked due to its limited geographic range and low visibility in the wild.</p>
<p>This introduction has expanded the known biodiversity of the region and provided valuable insights into its ecological adaptations.</p>
