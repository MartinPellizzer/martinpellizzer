                <h1>Acoridium pulogense</h1>
<p>Acoridium pulogense, commonly known as the Borneo arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acoraceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
<p>It plays an important part in the wetland ecosystems of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium pulogense has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium pulogense is primarily native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and consistent rainfall. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments within the undergrowth of tropical forests. It is often associated with swampy or peaty soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium pulogense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in warm and humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, where it has established itself in the wild. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including the movement of soil and plant material.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
