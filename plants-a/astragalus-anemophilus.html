<p>Astragalus anemophilus, commonly known as the wind-pollinated milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments. Its small, compound leaves and unique floral structure aid in its survival in low-resource habitats.</p>
<p>Astragalus anemophilus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators despite its limited visibility.</p>
