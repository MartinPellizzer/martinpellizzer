                    <h1>Anthemis kotschyana var. discoidea</h1>
<p>Anthemis kotschyana var. discoidea, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
