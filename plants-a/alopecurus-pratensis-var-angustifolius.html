<p>Alopecurus pratensis var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks, thriving in well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, two-lipped flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
