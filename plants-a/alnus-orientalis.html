                    <h1>Alnus orientalis</h1>
<p>Alnus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>Alnus orientalis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
