<p>Aulosema eximium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, three-lobed capsule, which splits open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Aulosema eximium is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
