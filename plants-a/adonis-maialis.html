<p>Adonis maialis, commonly known as the Alpine Adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, follicle-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adonis maialis is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
