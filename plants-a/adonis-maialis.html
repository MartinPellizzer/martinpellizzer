                <h1>Adonis maialis</h1>
<p>Adonis maialis, commonly known as the Alpine Adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, follicle-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adonis maialis is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis maialis has leaves that are basal, simple, and oblanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a prominent central yellow stamen, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing nutrients from poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis maialis is primarily native to Spain.</p>
<p>It is found in the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in southern regions. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils. It is commonly seen in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Spain, making it a regionally important species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis maialis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. The plant is known for its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its adaptability, it has spread to various parts of Europe and has been reported in some regions of North America.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora in non-native regions.</p>
