                <h1>Aegopodium involucratum</h1>
<p>Aegopodium involucratum, commonly known as the lesser cow-weed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which contain two separate seeds.</p>
<p>Aegopodium involucratum is also known for its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium involucratum has compound, pinnate leaves that are light green, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three one-seeded parts, with seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>
