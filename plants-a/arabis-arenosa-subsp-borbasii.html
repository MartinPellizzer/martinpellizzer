<p>Arabis arenosa subsp.</p>
<p>borbasii, commonly known as the sandstone rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in dry garden settings.</p>
