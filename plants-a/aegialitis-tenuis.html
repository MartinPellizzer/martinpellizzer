                <h1>Aegialitis tenuis</h1>
<p>Aegialitis tenuis, commonly known as the slender beach grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is adapted to sandy, saline environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance makes it a key species in coastal plant communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialitis tenuis has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a subtle pink tint, featuring four petals and a short floral stem, and they bloom in late spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy coastal soils.</p>
