                <h1>Aegiphila oligoneura</h1>
<p>Aegiphila oligoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that helps reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or white, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila oligoneura has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
