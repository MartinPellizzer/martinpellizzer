                <h1>Aegiphila serrata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila serrata, commonly known as the serrated aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila serrata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a pale yellow to greenish color, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
