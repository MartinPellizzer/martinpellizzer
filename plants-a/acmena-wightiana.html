                <h1>Acmena wightiana</h1>
<p>Acmena wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's acmena, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Acmena wightiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena wightiana has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena wightiana is a tropical shrub native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in these islands, though its distribution has been limited due to habitat loss. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and rocky crevices. It typically grows at altitudes between 100 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acmena wightiana is listed as endangered due to threats from deforestation and habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmena wightiana is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract scale insects or leaf spot under poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests and enhance the gardenâ€™s aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmena wightiana is a small evergreen shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting ecological balance. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, its leaves contribute to nutrient cycling, enriching the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmena wightiana is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
