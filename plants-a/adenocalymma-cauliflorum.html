                <h1>Adenocalymma cauliflorum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma cauliflorum, commonly known as the Cape fuchsia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to purple, often attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its arid native environment.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cauliflorum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and exhibits a woody texture, with a pale to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are clustered at the base of the stem, featuring showy, white petals with yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals through ingestion and excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, aiding in nutrient absorption from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cauliflorum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, including the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Espírito Santo. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates within this area. The plant is adapted to the diverse ecosystems present in these regions, such as Atlantic Forest and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the specific environmental conditions of the southeastern part of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cauliflorum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular moisture but can tolerate short periods of drought. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range.</p>
