                <h1>Acianthera punctata</h1>
<p>Acianthera punctata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive dark spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting various pollinators like bees and moths.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera punctata has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend trees or other structures. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically white or pale pink, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera punctata is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This orchid thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in shaded areas within the forest understory.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is largely restricted to the northeastern regions of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera punctata was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments and can often be seen growing in clusters along the ground. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
