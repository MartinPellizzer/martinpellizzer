                <h1>Aconitum intermedium</h1>
<p>Aconitum intermedium, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are typically tall and upright. Aconitum intermedium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It is known for its toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum intermedium has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically 10â€“20 cm in diameter, with deeply lobed, dark green foliage.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and has a blue-green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to violet, arranged in dense spike-like clusters, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces follicles as fruits, which release seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping it survive in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum intermedium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and along stream banks. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous or rocky substrates. Its native range extends into parts of Russia and the Balkans as well.</p>
<p>It is an ornamental plant that has been introduced to other parts of the world, but it remains most closely tied to its original habitat in Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum intermedium was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in the eastern United States. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained environments and can often be seen growing in woodland edges. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural areas, sometimes competing with native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact.</p>
