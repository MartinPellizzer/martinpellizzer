                    <h1>Athyana</h1>
<p>Athyana, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stems above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Athyana is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance in many Asian countries.</p>
