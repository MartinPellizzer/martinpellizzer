                <h1>Ancistrodesmus oleifolius</h1>
<p>Ancistrodesmus oleifolius, commonly known as the oil-leaved water clover, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that resemble a clover leaf.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can receive ample sunlight. The leaves are coated with a waxy layer that helps reduce water loss and provides protection against herbivores. Its small, green flowers are typically borne on slender stalks and bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
