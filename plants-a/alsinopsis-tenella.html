<p>Alsinopsis tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf burro's tail, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
