                <h1>Acinodendron novemnerve</h1>
<p>Acinodendron novemnerve, commonly known as the nine-veined acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with nine distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with five petals and stamens that are clustered around a central pistil.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron novemnerve has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green upper side and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron novemnerve is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas where the climate is warm and moist throughout the year. Its natural habitat includes both primary and secondary forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not commonly found outside of these native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron novemnerve was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is adequate moisture but not waterlogged conditions. The plant is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other invasive species in the same region.</p>
