                    <h1>Anthaenantiopsis fiebrigii</h1>
<p>Anthaenantiopsis fiebrigii, commonly known as the Fiebrig's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typically found in the understorey of dense rainforest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
