<p>Antennaria appendiculata, commonly known as the creeping mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to access nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
