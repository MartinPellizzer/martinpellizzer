                <h1>Adenanthos linearis</h1>
<p>Adenanthos linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is a shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Adenanthos linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos linearis has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos linearis is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the south-west region of the state, particularly in the coastal areas and adjacent ranges. This species thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with heathlands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the local climate, which includes hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenanthos linearis is an important part of the local flora and is often found in coastal and near-coastal habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos linearis was mainly introduced to urban and suburban gardens in southern Australia, particularly in South Australia and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its linear, grass-like foliage and showy pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often cultivated in rockeries, borders, and as part of native garden designs. Its introduction has been driven by its adaptability to well-drained soils and its ability to thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is not considered invasive in its introduced range.</p>
