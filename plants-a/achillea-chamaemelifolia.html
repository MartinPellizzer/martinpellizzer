                <h1>Achillea chamaemelifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea chamaemelifolia, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are deeply cut into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters called umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea chamaemelifolia has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, with a silvery-gray color due to the dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color that becomes woody with age, and they grow in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, composite, and arranged in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea chamaemelifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>While it was originally restricted to its native range, it is now cultivated and naturalized in various parts of the world, including the United States and parts of Asia. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by urbanization and changes in land use, leading to concerns for its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
