<p>Aspidium thelypteris, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near streams or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Aspidium thelypteris plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
