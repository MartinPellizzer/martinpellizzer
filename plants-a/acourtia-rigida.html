                <h1>Acourtia rigida</h1>
<p>Acourtia rigida, commonly known as the rigid acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, rigid leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Acourtia rigida is a perennial herb that is often found in coastal and inland desert regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia rigida has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense heads, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia rigida is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland grasslands, as well as rocky slopes and sandy soils. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often associated with serpentine soils. Its native range extends into parts of Nevada and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Acourtia rigida is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia rigida was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions in the United States, particularly in the western states. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its invasive potential in new ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often considered a problematic species in areas where it is not native.</p>
