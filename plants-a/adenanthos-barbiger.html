                <h1>Adenanthos barbiger</h1>
<p>Adenanthos barbiger, commonly known as the hairy adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, glandular hairs.</p>
<p>Adenanthos barbiger is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos barbiger has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, blooming from late winter to spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos barbiger is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas around the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Cape Le Grand National Park. This species thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and inland heathland communities. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with a dry summer and wet winter.</p>
<p>Adenanthos barbiger is an important component of the local flora and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos barbiger was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, quarries, and degraded native vegetation. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to the displacement of native plant species in certain environments.</p>
