<p>Aurinia saxatilis subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded rock aurinia, is a perennial herb native to rocky and alpine habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its subspecies distinction is primarily based on the size and shape of its seed capsules, which are larger and more robust compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
