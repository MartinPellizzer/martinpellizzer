<p>Allium fibrosum, commonly known as the fibrous garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its fibrous, white underground bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers in the summer, which are typically arranged in a loose umbel. Allium fibrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible bulbs, though they are less commonly used than other Allium species.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
