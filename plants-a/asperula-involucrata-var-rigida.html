                    <h1>Asperula involucrata var. rigida</h1>
<p>Asperula involucrata var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid woodrush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments.</p>
