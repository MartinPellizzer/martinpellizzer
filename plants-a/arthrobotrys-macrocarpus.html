                    <h1>Arthrobotrys macrocarpus</h1>
<p>Arthrobotrys macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant root rot fungus, is a parasitic nematode-trapping plant belonging to the family Mucoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy sporangia that can grow up to several centimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in moist, organic-rich soil and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique trapping mechanism involves the secretion of a sticky substance to ensnare nematodes.</p>
<p>This plant plays a significant role in soil nutrient cycling by decomposing organic matter and regulating nematode populations.</p>
