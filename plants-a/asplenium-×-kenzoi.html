                    <h1>Asplenium × kenzoi</h1>
<p>Asplenium × kenzoi, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × kenzoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
