                        <h1>Acanthomintha obovata subsp. cordata</h1>
<p>Acanthomintha obovata subsp.</p>
<p>cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf acanthomintha, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its obovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acanthomintha obovata subsp.</p>
<p>cordata belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of secondary cell walls and complex structures like stomata. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and some modern flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Lamiales, a group of flowering plants that includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs, often with showy flowers. Its family is Lamiaceae, commonly known as the mint family, characterized by square stems, opposite leaves, and aromatic compounds. Its genus is Acanthomintha, a group of flowering plants native to the Americas, typically with small, clustered flowers and hairy leaves. Its species is Acanthomintha obovata, a specific type within the genus known for its ovate leaves and is a subspecies of Acanthomintha obovata subsp.</p>
<p>cordata.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthomintha obovata subsp.</p>
<p>cordata is primarily native to California. It is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in the coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in open habitats. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological zones, reflecting its adaptation to local environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the native plant communities in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthomintha obovata subsp.</p>
<p>cordata was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
