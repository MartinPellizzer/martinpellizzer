                        <h1>Acaena pinnatifida subsp. nudiscapa</h1>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>nudiscapa, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features stiff, spiny stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces burr-like fruits with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to a range of habitats, including forests and coastal areas, and is known for its persistent, woody structure.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>nudiscapa is primarily native to South Island of New Zealand. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions, particularly in the Southern Alps.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils and open vegetation. It is typically associated with areas that have a cool, moist climate and limited soil depth.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the native flora in these high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>nudiscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering.</p>
<p>However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth has led to the displacement of native vegetation in some areas.</p>
