<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>nudiscapa, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features stiff, spiny stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces burr-like fruits with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to a range of habitats, including forests and coastal areas, and is known for its persistent, woody structure.</p>
