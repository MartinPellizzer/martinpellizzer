<p>Artemisia gracilescens, commonly known as slender wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Artemisia gracilescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
