                <h1>Adelia spartioides</h1>
<p>Adelia spartioides, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. It has a low-growing habit and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Adelia spartioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia spartioides has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia spartioides is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandy soils, and coastal areas where it thrives in harsh, dry conditions. This plant is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia spartioides was mainly introduced to coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, such as parts of California and southern Australia. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It has become naturalized in some areas, leading to concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity, including landscaping and erosion control efforts.</p>
