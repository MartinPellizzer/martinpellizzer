                <h1>Achillea joffrei</h1>
<p>Achillea joffrei, commonly known as the Corsican yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and hairy, with a light green color, growing straight upward from the base. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern France, particularly in the Massif Central.</p>
<p>It is currently found in limited areas within its native range, with some populations also cultivated in botanical gardens. This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Achillea joffrei is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei is a compact, flowering plant known for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late winter. The growth cycle of Achillea joffrei involves a dormant period in winter, with new growth emerging in spring and blooming in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune dead foliage after flowering to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and a habitat for nesting. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to deter pests. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea joffrei contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, known for its ornamental value and diverse applications.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in horticulture for landscaping and garden design due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. While it is not widely used in culinary traditions, some parts of the plant may have minor medicinal properties, though research is limited. Its presence in traditional landscapes contributes to cultural and symbolic meanings, often associated with resilience and beauty.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications are minimal compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei has several popular cultivars such as 'Pink Beauty' and 'The Pearl,' which are prized for their soft, pastel flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybrid breeding programs to develop new varieties with improved color, disease resistance, and adaptability. These hybrids often combine the hardiness of Achillea millefolium with the ornamental value of A. joffrei. Due to its attractive foliage and long blooming period, it holds significant horticultural importance in garden design.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it a valuable addition to both perennial borders and rock gardens.</p>
