                <h1>Achillea joffrei</h1>
<p>Achillea joffrei, commonly known as the Joffre yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the French Alps.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that bear dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France, particularly in the Pyrenees and Cevennes.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in its native range, with limited introductions outside of cultivation. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to sunny, open environments. It typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,800 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea joffrei is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and ability to thrive in various garden conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea joffrei includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea joffrei is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its blossoms for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achillea joffrei also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
