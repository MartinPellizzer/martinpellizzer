                    <h1>Apatelantha albicans</h1>
<p>Apatelantha albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white flowers and unique morphology, which includes a single, elongated stem with a single flower at the apex. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Apatelantha albicans is considered a conservation concern.</p>
