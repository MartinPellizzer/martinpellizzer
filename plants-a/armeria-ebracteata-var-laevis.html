                    <h1>Armeria ebracteata var. laevis</h1>
<p>Armeria ebracteata var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its stems are usually prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and colonize rocky areas.</p>
<p>The variety laevis is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Armeria ebracteata.</p>
