                <h1>Adenia gracilis</h1>
<p>Adenia gracilis, commonly known as the slender adenia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and dry forest habitats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia gracilis has small, narrow, and elongated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are yellow with red stamens, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated by birds. The fruit is a fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through animals after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its rocky or sandy habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia gracilis is primarily native to Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, DR Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of these countries, typically in moist forested areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often encountered in the understory of dense tropical rainforests.</p>
