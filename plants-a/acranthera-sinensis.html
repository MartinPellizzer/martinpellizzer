                <h1>Acranthera sinensis</h1>
<p>Acranthera sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Acranthera sinensis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its traditional uses in Chinese medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera sinensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and often has a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera sinensis is a rare flowering plant native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Asia, including Southeast Asia, as a horticultural species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Acranthera sinensis typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
