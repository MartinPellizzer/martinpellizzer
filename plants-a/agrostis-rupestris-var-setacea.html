The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it adaptable to harsh conditions, contributing to its ecological resilience.</p>
