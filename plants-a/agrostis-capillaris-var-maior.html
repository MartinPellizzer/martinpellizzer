<p>Agrostis capillaris var. maior, commonly known as tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small spikelets, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
