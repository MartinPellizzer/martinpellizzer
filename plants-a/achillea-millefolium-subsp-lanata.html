<p>lanata, commonly known as lamb's ear, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage composed of velvety, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white, pink, or yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from the mythological tale of Achilles and his nurse, who used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>lanata has leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a silver-gray color due to dense pubescence. The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a light green to reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
