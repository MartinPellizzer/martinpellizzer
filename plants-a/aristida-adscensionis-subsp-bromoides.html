<p>Aristida adscensionis subsp.</p>
<p>bromoides, commonly known as the bromoides false lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dryland gardens due to its drought tolerance.</p>
