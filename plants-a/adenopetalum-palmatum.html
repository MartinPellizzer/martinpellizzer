                <h1>Adenopetalum palmatum</h1>
<p>Adenopetalum palmatum, commonly known as the palmate adenopetalum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive palmate venation pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum palmatum is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum palmatum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are medium in size and have a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five pink to red petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum palmatum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Sonora and Chihuahua. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and open areas, including desert and scrub habitats. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can thrive with minimal water availability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum palmatum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands and along forest edges, where it forms dense colonies. The plant is known for its attractive, palmately compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
