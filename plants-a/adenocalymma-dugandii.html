                <h1>Adenocalymma dugandii</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma dugandii, commonly known as the Brazilian flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its bark is smooth and reddish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma dugandii is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma dugandii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular corolla, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's climbing habit and providing stability in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma dugandii is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and adjacent lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the cloud forests and secondary growth areas. It is commonly observed in the departments of Antioquia, Cauca, and Nari√±o.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma dugandii plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the diverse flora of Colombia's rich biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma dugandii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in warm climates with moderate rainfall, making it suitable for regions with a humid subtropical climate. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and Colombia.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some local ecosystems.</p>
