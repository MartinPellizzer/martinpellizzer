                    <h1>Ampelopsis ternata</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis ternata, commonly known as the climbing false ivy, is a woody vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with three to five leaflets, and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its vigorous climbing habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
