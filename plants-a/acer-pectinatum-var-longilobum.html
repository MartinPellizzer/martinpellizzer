                <h1>Acer pectinatum var. longilobum</h1>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. longilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with long, pointed lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree or shrub. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. longilobum is a rare and ornamental maple species native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including temperate regions of North America and Europe, often as an ornamental plant. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate to subtropical climates, typically growing in shaded to semi-shaded environments within forests. It is commonly found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited cultivation, Acer pectinatum var. longilobum is considered to be of conservation concern, with populations facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. longilobum is a striking ornamental tree known for its delicate, lace-like leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This species has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 10–15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials such as hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. longilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem pollination. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in carbon sequestration, supporting overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. longilobum is a decorative tree known for its ornamental value in landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and carving. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty in regions where it is native.</p>
<p>Its presence in gardens and parks also contributes to ecological biodiversity and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. longilobum has several popular cultivars such as 'Atropurpureum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their vibrant autumn colors and striking foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maples, leading to cultivars like 'Crimson King' and 'Red Sunset' that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and broader leaf coloration, making them more adaptable to different climates. The horticultural importance of this species lies in its ability to add seasonal interest to gardens with its showy red and yellow foliage.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are widely cultivated for their aesthetic value in landscaping and ornamental horticulture.</p>
