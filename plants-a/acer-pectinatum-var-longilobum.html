<p>Acer pectinatum var. longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>
