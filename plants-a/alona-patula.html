<p>Alona patula, commonly known as the narrowleaf water-measure, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is native to freshwater habitats in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water surface, with a long, slender stem that supports its flowering structure. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a spathe that encloses the spadix, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>Alona patula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its biological activity.</p>
