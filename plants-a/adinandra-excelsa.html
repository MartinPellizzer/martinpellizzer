                <h1>Adinandra excelsa</h1>
<p>Adinandra excelsa, commonly known as the tall ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>Adinandra excelsa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra excelsa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, spherical drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra excelsa is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and hill forests of the island. This species typically grows in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed areas within its range.</p>
<p>Adinandra excelsa plays a role in the ecological dynamics of Borneo's forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra excelsa was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often growing in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It has also been introduced as an ornamental species in some parts of Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
