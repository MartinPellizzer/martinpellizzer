<p>Adhatoda natalensis, commonly known as Natal Adhatoda, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Adhatoda natalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda natalensis has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown or reddish-brown in color. The flowers are clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals, and they bloom during the summer months, being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
