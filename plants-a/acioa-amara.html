                <h1>Acioa amara</h1>
<p>Acioa amara, commonly known as the bitter acioa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Acioa amara is known for its bitter taste, which is attributed to the presence of alkaloids in its leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical and pharmacological properties remain under study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa amara has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin, flaky layers. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, bloom in the spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa amara is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and is often associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>
<p>Acioa amara is known for its medicinal properties and is used by local communities for various traditional remedies.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa amara was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun. The plant's ability to adapt to different soil types makes it a successful invader in non-native regions. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance, leading to potential ecological impacts.</p>
<p>Its spread has been documented in several regions where it competes with native flora.</p>
