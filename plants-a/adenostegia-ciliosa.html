                <h1>Adenostegia ciliosa</h1>
<p>Adenostegia ciliosa, commonly known as the hairy stemless sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stem and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has hairy leaves and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Adenostegia ciliosa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia ciliosa has leaves that are simple, elliptical in shape, and alternate in arrangement, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia ciliosa is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as California, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Baja California. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and open woodlands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its association with Mediterranean-type climates characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia ciliosa was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in such environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
