                <h1>Aconitum chinense</h1>
<p>Aconitum chinense, commonly known as Chinese aconite, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum chinense has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a dark green underside, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish-brown in color, with a hollow interior and a growth pattern that is usually branching towards the top. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and a spurred lower petal, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, serving as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum chinense is primarily native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forest understories. It is also known to grow in rocky and clayey soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its natural habitat remains primarily in Japan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum chinense was mainly introduced to North America and Europe as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in some regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of the United Kingdom. Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic and requires careful handling to prevent accidental poisoning. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is commonly found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland areas where it can spread rapidly if left unchecked.</p>
