<p>Anisophyllum humistratum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling stems and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Anisophyllum humistratum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
