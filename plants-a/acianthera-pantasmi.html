<p>Acianthera pantasmi, commonly known as the Brazilian violet, is a species of orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor.</p>
<p>Acianthera pantasmi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera pantasmi has narrow, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slight fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pantasmi is primarily native to Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of Central America. It typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate floral structures.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the specific ecological conditions of these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pantasmi was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries, including Brazil, Colombia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, proper management is necessary to prevent its spread into natural areas.</p>
