<p>It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves arranged in a pyramidal shape. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
