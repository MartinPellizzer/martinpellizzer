                    <h1>Aloe aristata</h1>
<p>Aloe aristata, commonly known as the "Frostplant" or "Lace Aloe," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Aloe aristata thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
