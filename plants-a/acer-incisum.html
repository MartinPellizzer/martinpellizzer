<p>Acer incisum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The tree produces small, red to yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>Acer incisum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
