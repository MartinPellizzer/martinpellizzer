                <h1>Acer incisum</h1>
<p>Acer incisum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The tree produces small, red to yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>Acer incisum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer incisum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer incisum is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, temperate forests and mountainous areas, often growing in shaded, well-drained soils. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer incisum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer incisum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance its growth and soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer incisum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers in spring. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer incisum contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and supporting a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
