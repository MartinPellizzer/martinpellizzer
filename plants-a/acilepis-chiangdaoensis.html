                <h1>Acilepis chiangdaoensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis chiangdaoensis, commonly known as the Chiangdao endemic, is a rare flowering plant native to a specific region in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique leaf structure and small, delicate flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential role in ecological studies of endemic flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis chiangdaoensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis chiangdaoensis is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>This plant is found in specific regions within Thailand, particularly in the southern and central parts of the country. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. The species is commonly associated with forested areas and is sometimes found in secondary growth habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally significant plant in Thai biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis chiangdaoensis was mainly introduced to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in Chiang Dao, a region in northern Thailand, hence its specific name. The plant has been introduced to various tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability to different climates. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique foliage and resilience.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
