<p>Abies forrestii var. chengii, commonly known as the Cheng's fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to a limited region in southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
