<p>Allium sordidum, commonly known as the stinking onion, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulbs are small and often overlooked.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not closely related to the culinary onions but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
