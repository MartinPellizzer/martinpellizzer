<p>Aria rupicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow.
