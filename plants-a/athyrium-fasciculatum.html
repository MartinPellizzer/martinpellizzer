                    <h1>Athyrium fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds, giving the plant its common name.</p>
