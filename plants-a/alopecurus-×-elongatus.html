                    <h1>Alopecurus × elongatus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus × elongatus, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a hybrid grass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers. This plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wet environments, with rhizomes that aid in spreading and survival.</p>
