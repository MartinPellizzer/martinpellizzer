                    <h1>Adesmia muricata var. hispidula</h1>
<p>Adesmia muricata var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy leaf burro bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny leaves that are densely covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a follicle containing several seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
