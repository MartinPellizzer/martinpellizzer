                    <h1>Andropus carnosus</h1>
<p>Andropus carnosus, commonly known as the meaty plant, is a unique species characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, leading to the development of edible, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Its leaves are thick and coated with a waxy layer, reducing water loss and enhancing its survival in dry climates.</p>
