                <h1>Acinodendron confertum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron confertum, commonly known as the dense-fruited acinodendron, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron confertum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron confertum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing near the forest floor. It is an evergreen shrub that plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron confertum was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along roadsides, construction sites, and abandoned lots where it spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its tolerance to drought and salt make it a persistent weed in these environments. Due to its invasive tendencies, it has become a concern in several regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread often involve mechanical removal and herbicide application in affected areas.</p>
