                <h1>Achillea alexandri-regis</h1>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis, commonly known as Alexandrian yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its common name honors Alexander the Great, who is said to have used it to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a light green color and a smooth texture. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis is a flowering plant native to the island of Rhodes in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed primarily in the wild on the island of Rhodes, with some records of cultivation in botanical gardens. This species thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on slopes and in open habitats. It typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea alexandri-regis is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of white or pink flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, with the first year focusing on vegetative growth and the second year producing flowers and seeds before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis is a plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea alexandri-regis contributes to the ecological balance by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis is a lesser-known plant species within the Asteraceae family, primarily noted for its ornamental value in horticulture due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may incorporate it in local herbal teas or infusions. Its medicinal properties remain under-researched, but like other members of the genus, it may possess potential anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial benefits. In terms of industrial and economic use, it contributes minimally to commercial agriculture or industry.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions, though its role in cultural traditions is not well documented.</p>

<p>Achillea alexandri-regis has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability, including 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea'.</p>
<p>These cultivars are known for their vibrant foliage and showy yellow or purple flower heads. While natural hybrids of Achillea alexandri-regis are less common, horticulturists have developed various selections to enhance garden aesthetics. The plant holds significant horticultural importance due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its use in landscaping and floral arrangements further underscores its value in modern gardening.</p>
