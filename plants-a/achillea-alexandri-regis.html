                <h1>Achillea alexandri-regis</h1>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis, commonly known as Alexandrian yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale pink. The plant features finely divided, aromatic leaves and produces numerous small flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing upright with a branched structure. Its flowers are compound umbels composed of small white to pale yellow florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, facilitating wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Balkans and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes scattered populations in its native range, with some plants cultivated in botanical gardens. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species, though its conservation status is not yet fully assessed.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis is a perennial flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow blooms and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora by improving soil conditions. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and food for small mammals and insects, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in landscaping due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary applications, as it is not commonly used in food preparation. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant also holds cultural significance in some regions, symbolizing protection and healing.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it plays a minor role in industrial and economic contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea alexandri-regis has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Paprika', which are known for their vibrant yellow and orange flower colors. Hybrids of this species often exhibit enhanced hardiness and extended blooming periods, making them more adaptable to various garden conditions. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and gardens for their long-lasting flowers and low maintenance requirements.</p>
