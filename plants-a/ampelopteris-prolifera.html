<p>Ampelopteris prolifera, commonly known as the rock tassel fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, creeping fern that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry rhizomes and clustered, small, scale-like fronds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Ampelopteris prolifera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
