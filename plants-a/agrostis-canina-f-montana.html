<p>Agrostis canina f. montana, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats such as mountain slopes and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
