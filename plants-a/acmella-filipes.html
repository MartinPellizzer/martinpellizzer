                <h1>Acmella filipes</h1>
<p>Acmella filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella filipes has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are generally green with a slightly hairy surface, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that peels off in thin layers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella filipes is primarily native to Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Southeast, Nicaragua.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or near water sources. The species is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella filipes was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its invasive potential in non-native areas. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact and management challenges.</p>
