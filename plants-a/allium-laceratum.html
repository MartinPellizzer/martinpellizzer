                    <h1>Allium laceratum</h1>
<p>Allium laceratum, commonly known as the shaggy onion, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible when young but become more fibrous and less palatable as they mature.</p>
<p>Allium laceratum is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
