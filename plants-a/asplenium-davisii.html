<p>Asplenium davisii, commonly known as the Davis's spleenwort, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium davisii is primarily found in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in humid, forested habitats.</p>
