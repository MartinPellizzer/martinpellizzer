                    <h1>Arabidopsis halleri f. alpicola</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis halleri f. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine Arabidopsis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring subspecies of Arabidopsis halleri, characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers. This plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in rocky soils and harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features include hairy stems, alternate leaves, and a short life cycle, making it an important species in ecological and genetic studies.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to Arabidopsis thaliana, it is also used as a model organism in plant biology research.</p>
