                <h1>Achyranthes spinosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes spinosa, commonly known as the prickly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Achyranthes spinosa is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes spinosa has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they are typically 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes spinosa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, clayey soils. This plant is also present in parts of Africa and the Caribbean, though its distribution is less widespread there. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to humid climates with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes spinosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. This plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in areas where it establishes itself without natural predators.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, Achyranthes spinosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
