                    <h1>Asclepias cristata</h1>
<p>Asclepias cristata, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Asclepias cristata is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential food for its larvae.</p>
<p>Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to most animals but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
