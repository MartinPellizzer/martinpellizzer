<p>Aspidium lobatiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate to ovate fronds that are often deeply lobed, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Aspidium lobatiforme is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
