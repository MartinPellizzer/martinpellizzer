<p>Anthericum elongatum var. flexifolium, commonly known as the flexible sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often flexible fronds.</p>
<p>This plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually arching and can grow up to several feet in length, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sori.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions.</p>
