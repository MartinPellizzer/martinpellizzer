<p>Acaena argentea var. gracillima, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena argentea var. gracillima is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena argentea var. gracillima was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and land management.</p>
