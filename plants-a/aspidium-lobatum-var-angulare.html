<p>Aspidium lobatum var. angulare, commonly known as the angular water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and can be used in ornamental water gardens.</p>
