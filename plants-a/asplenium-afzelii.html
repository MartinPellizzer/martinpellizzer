<p>Asplenium afzelii, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often crinkled or curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Asplenium afzelii is a hardy species that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
