<p>Asplenium glandulosum subsp.</p>
<p>bivalens, commonly known as the two-lobed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, glossy leaves that are often divided into two lobes, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
