                <h1>Achyrophorus setosus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus setosus, commonly known as the hairy achyrosperma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus setosus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus setosus is primarily native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas. This plant thrives in regions with cool, temperate climates. It is often associated with old-growth forests and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes states such as New York, Vermont, and Maine, as well as parts of Ontario and Quebec.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus setosus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to establish quickly in disturbed environments. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
