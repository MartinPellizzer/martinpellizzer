                <h1>Adenogramma littoralis</h1>
<p>Adenogramma littoralis, commonly known as the coastal adenogramma, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adenogramma littoralis is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient species in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma littoralis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming from May to July and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in coastal soils, helping it withstand saline conditions and strong winds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma littoralis is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the southern coast of Africa. This plant thrives in saline and well-drained environments. It is often seen growing near the shoreline or in dune systems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the western and southern regions of the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma littoralis was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine habitats where it can thrive in saline and brackish environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove forests and along the shores of tidal flats. This plant has been introduced to various regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and artificial wetlands.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
