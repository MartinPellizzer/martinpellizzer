                    <h1>Acacia irrorata</h1>
<p>Acacia irrorata, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Acacia irrorata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in hard pods and are often dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
