                <h1>Acer tataricum subsp. aidzuense</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>aidzuense, commonly known as the Aidzu maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscape design.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>aidzuense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>aidzuense is a rare variant of the maple species native to Japan, specifically found in the Chubu and Kansai regions. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in central Japan, primarily in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, growing in moist, well-drained soils within forests or along stream banks. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>aidzuense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>aidzuense is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>aidzuense is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to soil stabilization and offers ecological benefits by improving habitat quality for native species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>aidzuense is a lesser-known species of maple primarily found in specific regions of East Asia, and while it may not have widespread culinary use, it has been historically valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Its wood, though not as commercially significant as other maple species, can be used in small-scale woodworking and carving.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic importance in local traditions or as a marker of regional biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it plays a role in ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely niche compared to more widely cultivated maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>aidzuense has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, such as 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which showcase striking yellow and variegated foliage. It is also used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness and more vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>These hybrids often combine the hardiness of Acer tataricum with the aesthetic appeal of other maple species. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its adaptability to a range of garden conditions and its ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and compact growth make it a sought-after choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
