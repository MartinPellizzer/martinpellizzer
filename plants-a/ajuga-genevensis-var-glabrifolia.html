                    <h1>Ajuga genevensis var. glabrifolia</h1>
<p>Ajuga genevensis var. glabrifolia, commonly known as slender bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated settings.</p>
