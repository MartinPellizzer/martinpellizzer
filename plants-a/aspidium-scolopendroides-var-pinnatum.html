                    <h1>Aspidium scolopendroides var. pinnatum</h1>
<p>Aspidium scolopendroides var. pinnatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water fern family with distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wetlands. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a broad, lanceolate shape and a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in aquatic or bog gardens.</p>
