                    <h1>Aeollanthus medusa</h1>
<p>Aeollanthus medusa, commonly known as the Medusa's ghost, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant is known for its unique ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with low oxygen levels and intense sunlight. Its name is derived from its striking resemblance to the mythological figure of Medusa, with its intricate, hair-like structures resembling serpents.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Aeollanthus medusa is considered a conservation concern.</p>
