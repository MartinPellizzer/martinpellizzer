                    <h1>Allagoptera pumila</h1>
<p>Allagoptera pumila, commonly known as the smoothleaf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. Its root system is extensive and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
