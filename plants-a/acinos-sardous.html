                <h1>Acinos sardous</h1>
<p>Acinos sardous, commonly known as the Sardinian mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sardinia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale blue to white ray florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Acinos sardous is adapted to withstand harsh climates and is an important component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos sardous has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is wiry and somewhat hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in dense, spherical heads, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos sardous is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, Balearic Islands, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas, cliffs, and dry, sunny slopes. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Mediterranean climate. It is often seen growing in limestone or sandy soils along the coast.</p>
<p>Acinos sardous is an important part of the local flora and is characteristic of the Mediterranean maquis vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos sardous was mainly introduced to California, particularly in the southern and central regions, as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various disturbed sites, including roadsides and open grasslands. The plant is often found in dry, sunny areas with well-drained soils, which supports its growth in these introduced habitats. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as an invasive species in the state.</p>
