                <h1>Acinos sardous</h1>
<p>Acinos sardous, commonly known as the Sardinian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. The plant features a compact rosette of silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Acinos sardous is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos sardous has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in fine hairs, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos sardous is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is primarily within the region of Andalusia, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. This plant prefers sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acinos sardous is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos sardous is a hardy, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its compact size and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature plants, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acinos sardous is typically perennial, with active growth in spring and dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is limited to removing dead or damaged foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos sardous is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its yellow flowers, contributing to biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in natural ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acinos sardous helps improve soil fertility by acting as a nitrogen fixer, supporting the health of surrounding vegetation.</p>
