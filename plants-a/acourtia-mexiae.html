                <h1>Acourtia mexiae</h1>
<p>Acourtia mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming shrub with narrow, grayish-green leaves. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acourtia mexiae is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia mexiae has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark that remains relatively compact throughout its growth. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant is found.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia mexiae is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It is commonly seen in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific locations within the southwestern part of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia mexiae was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought to these areas as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in disturbed habitats. The plant thrives in sandy soils and full sun, making it difficult to control once established.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
