                    <h1>Acanthocarpea</h1>
<p>Acanthocarpea, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, spiny structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are segmented and can bear bladders for capturing prey.</p>
<p>Acanthocarpea species are primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
