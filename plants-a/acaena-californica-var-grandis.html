<p>Acaena californica var. grandis, commonly known as the large burclover, is a perennial shrub native to California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, spherical burrs that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
