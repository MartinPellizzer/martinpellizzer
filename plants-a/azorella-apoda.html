                    <h1>Azorella apoda</h1>
<p>Azorella apoda, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant forms dense, low-growing cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Azorella apoda is adapted to extreme conditions, including strong winds, low temperatures, and poor soil, making it a resilient member of alpine ecosystems.</p>
