<p>Anomalostylus crateriformis, commonly known as the cup-shaped liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like thallus that forms a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its morphology includes a central axis with lateral branches that bear leaf-like structures called phyllodes.</p>
<p>Anomalostylus crateriformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
