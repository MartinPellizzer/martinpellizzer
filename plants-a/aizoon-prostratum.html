                    <h1>Aizoon prostratum</h1>
<p>Aizoon prostratum, commonly known as creeping aizoon, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Aizoon prostratum is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides or in dry grasslands.</p>
