                <h1>Acer hispanicum var. xauense</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. xauense, commonly known as the Xauen maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often turning vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse seeds by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Acer genus with unique regional adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. xauense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, a glossy dark green upper surface, and a lighter underside; they are typically 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in upright catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. xauense is a rare variety of maple native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Spain.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to the Sierra de Cazorla and Sierra de Andújar regions in Jaén province. Currently, its distribution is very restricted, with only a few known populations. It thrives in dry, rocky environments at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. xauense is a rare and ornamental maple species that requires careful cultivation to thrive.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed stratification or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, followed by light pruning to shape the tree and encourage healthy growth. While it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can help deter pests and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. xauense is a native plant that provides food and shelter for local wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting the reproductive success of other plants in the area. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to various organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. xauense is a rare and ornamental tree native to the Canary Islands, primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In terms of industrial and economic use, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports ecological tourism in its native region. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in the Canary Islands, representing the unique flora of the region.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and rarity, its applications remain largely restricted to ecological and ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. xauense has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which showcase striking yellow and variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It is also known for its natural hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer negundo, which contribute to the genetic diversity within the genus. These hybrids often exhibit unique traits that make them desirable in horticultural settings. The plant's variability makes it a valuable resource for breeding programs aimed at developing new cultivars with enhanced ornamental characteristics.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, Acer hispanicum var. xauense holds significant horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes.</p>
