<p>Acer hispanicum var. xauense, commonly known as the Xauen maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
