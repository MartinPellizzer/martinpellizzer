                    <h1>Aristida mutabilis var. aequilonga</h1>
<p>Aristida mutabilis var. aequilonga, commonly known as the long-stemmed threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, three-awned spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces delicate, pale green to brown inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions.</p>
