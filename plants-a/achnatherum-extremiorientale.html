                <h1>Achnatherum extremiorientale</h1>
<p>Achnatherum extremiorientale, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in water conservation.</p>
<p>Achnatherum extremiorientale plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum extremiorientale has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in length from 10 to 30 centimeters with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to pale yellow color, growing upright and branching sparingly. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in the soil and helping it survive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum extremiorientale is primarily native to central and eastern Asia, including regions such as China, Mongolia, and Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, steppes, and mountainous areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates and is often associated with dry or semi-arid environments. It is particularly prevalent in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions of China.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into parts of Central Asia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum extremiorientale was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, railway embankments, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with low to moderate precipitation. The plant's introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and transportation infrastructure. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common pioneer species in these environments.</p>
<p>However, it is generally not considered invasive and is more of a transient colonizer in disturbed landscapes.</p>
