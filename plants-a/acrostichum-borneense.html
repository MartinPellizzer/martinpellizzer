                <h1>Acrostichum borneense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean holly fern, is a tropical plant native to the islands of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum borneense has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum borneense is primarily native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland rainforests and swampy areas of Southeast Asia. This plant thrives in humid and tropical climates, particularly in regions with high rainfall. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Borneo, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum borneense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. It has been introduced to various parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements.</p>
