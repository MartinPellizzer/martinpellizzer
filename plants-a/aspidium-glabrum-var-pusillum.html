                    <h1>Aspidium glabrum var. pusillum</h1>
<p>Aspidium glabrum var. pusillum, commonly known as the small smooth shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact, dense fronds.</p>
<p>It typically features lanceolate to ovate-shaped leaves that are glabrous, or smooth, with a dark green coloration. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its smaller size compared to the typical form of *Aspidium glabrum*.</p>
