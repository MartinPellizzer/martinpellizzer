                <h1>Acrostichum articulatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum articulatum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively. Its fronds are divided into segments that are connected by jointed stalks, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum articulatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum articulatum has long, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or climbing manner. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a globose drupe, containing a single seed that is dispersed by water or animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet or marshy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum articulatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, mangrove swamps, and along coastal areas where there is high humidity and saline conditions. This plant thrives in brackish or freshwater environments, often growing in dense stands along estuaries and riverbanks. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum articulatum was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine areas where it thrives in brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate saltwater and periodic flooding. Its introduction has helped in preventing erosion and improving water quality in certain wetland environments.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
