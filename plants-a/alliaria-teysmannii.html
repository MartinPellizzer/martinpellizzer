                    <h1>Alliaria teysmannii</h1>
<p>Alliaria teysmannii, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and is characterized by its pinnately lobed leaves and small white or purple flowers. The plant produces round, seed-like pods that contain several tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from sulfur-containing compounds in its leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
