                <h1>Achyronia albens</h1>
<p>Achyronia albens, commonly known as the white achyronia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, soft pubescence.</p>
<p>Achyronia albens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia albens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, medium-sized, and provide a dense canopy. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia albens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in areas with high moisture levels and is often associated with sandy or disturbed soils. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native wetland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia albens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along waterways.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is often found in temperate regions where it can establish itself quickly due to its rapid growth rate. Its introduction has led to its spread in various parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions, with limited ecological impact.</p>
