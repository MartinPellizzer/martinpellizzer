<p>Alchemilla × pentaphylloides, commonly known as the five-leafed lady's mantle, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period.</p>
