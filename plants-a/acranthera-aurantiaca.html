                <h1>Acranthera aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Acranthera aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange bell orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that resemble bells. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Acranthera aurantiaca is a perennial herb that is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera aurantiaca has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dull green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with bright yellow petals and a white throat, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, smooth seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera aurantiaca is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the lowland and hill forest regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly associated with areas of high humidity. The species is known for its bright orange flowers, which make it a notable component of the local flora.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera aurantiaca was mainly introduced to the area of South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and rocky habitats, often growing in open areas with well-drained soils. This plant is known for its bright orange flowers, which bloom during the warmer months of the year. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its unique color and compact size.</p>
<p>However, it is important to manage its spread to prevent it from becoming invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
