<p>Atriplex angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>erecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, salt-excreting crystals.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable component of desert ecosystems. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This species is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
