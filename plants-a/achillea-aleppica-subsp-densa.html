<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>densa, commonly known as Aleppo thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in dense, gray-green leaves with spiny margins.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is noted, though its ornamental value is often overshadowed by its prickly foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>densa has basal, lanceolate leaves that are dark green in color, with a slightly rough texture and arranged in a rosette pattern. The stems are upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a grayish-green color.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, allowing for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>densa is a perennial flowering plant native to the Middle East, specifically found in regions of Syria and Turkey. Its current distribution includes parts of the Levant and has been introduced to some areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky environments, often growing in open grasslands and along slopes. This subspecies is typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica subsp.</p>
<p>densa is a hardy perennial plant known for its dense, dark green foliage and showy yellow flowers. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2 to 3 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
