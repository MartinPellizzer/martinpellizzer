                <h1>Acer platanoides f. commune</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides f. commune, commonly known as the Norway maple, is a cultivar of the Norway maple tree, characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically green with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates, often reaching heights of 20 to 30 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to establish itself firmly in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can be harvested for medicinal purposes in some traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides f. commune has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes, with a broad, rounded shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 10-20 cm in length, with a bright green color during the growing season and turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and grouped in clusters, with greenish-yellow petals, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod, which is dispersed by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, providing stability and enabling the plant to absorb nutrients from the topsoil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides f. commune is a variant of the Norway maple, originally native to central and northern Europe.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in its native range across parts of Europe, it is now primarily cultivated in temperate regions worldwide. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although not listed as endangered, its natural habitat is threatened by urbanization and habitat loss, leading to a conservation status that is of concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides f. commune is a decorative tree known for its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to maintain shape and health are essential for optimal growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides f. commune is a tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, offering shade and reducing soil erosion in forested areas. The tree also contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem stability.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides f. commune is a decorative tree primarily valued for its ornamental qualities, such as its broad, palmate leaves and striking autumn coloration, making it a popular choice in landscaping and urban gardening.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in some cultures. The tree has limited medicinal use, with some historical references to its bark being used for its astringent properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, though its wood is not as economically significant as other maple species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes beauty and resilience, often featured in parks and public spaces to enhance aesthetic value.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides f. commune has a variety of cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Drummondii' and 'Aureum', which are known for their distinctive foliage colors and growth habits.</p>
<p>It also has several hybrids that combine traits from related maple species, enhancing its adaptability and visual appeal in gardens. These cultivars and hybrids are valued for their ability to thrive in a range of climates and soil conditions. They are commonly used in landscaping for their aesthetic contribution and structural form.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer platanoides f. commune plays a significant role in horticulture due to its versatility and ornamental qualities.</p>
