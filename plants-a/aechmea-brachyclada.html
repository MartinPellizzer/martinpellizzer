<p>It features a dense rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is covered in fine, white trichomes that help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant orange to red flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Aechmea brachyclada thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical appearance.</p>
