                <h1>Acosmium panamense</h1>
<p>Acosmium panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian acosmium, is a flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes. It produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium panamense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium panamense is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Panama and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and humid montane areas. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with understory vegetation in dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium panamense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats, making it a potential invasive species in certain areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
