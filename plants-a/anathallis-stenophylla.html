<p>Anathallis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed anathallid, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. Anathallis stenophylla thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species within its native range.</p>
