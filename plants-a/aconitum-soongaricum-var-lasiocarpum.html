                    <h1>Aconitum soongaricum var. lasiocarpum</h1>
<p>Aconitum soongaricum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the wooly-fruited monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple, spurred flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered with a dense layer of silky hairs. Its unique morphology and habitat preference make it a notable species in alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, requiring caution during handling or study.</p>
