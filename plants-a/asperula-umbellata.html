<p>Asperula umbellata, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, glossy leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces delicate, fragrant white flowers in early spring, arranged in umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees.
