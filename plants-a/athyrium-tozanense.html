<p>Athyrium tozanense, commonly known as the Tozan fern, is a species native to East Asia, particularly Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its visual appeal.</p>
