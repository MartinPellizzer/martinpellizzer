<p>Alchemilla splendens var. jaquetiana, commonly known as the splendour lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features attractive, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and long flowering period, which adds interest throughout the growing season.</p>
