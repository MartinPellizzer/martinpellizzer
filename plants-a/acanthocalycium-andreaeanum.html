<p>Acanthocalycium andreaeanum, commonly known as the Andean prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocalycium andreaeanum is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is found in regions with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in the Mojave Desert and surrounding areas. This species typically grows in rocky soils and is often associated with limestone formations. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is known for its distinctive spiny stems and small, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocalycium andreaeanum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in regions with arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in states such as Arizona, Nevada, and California, where it thrives in well-drained sandy soils. This species is often cultivated in desert gardens and rockeries due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.
