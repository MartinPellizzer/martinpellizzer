                    <h1>Anisophyllum amoenum</h1>
<p>Anisophyllum amoenum, commonly known as the dwarf mountain spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in early summer. Its stems are short and creeping, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anisophyllum amoenum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions.</p>
