                <h1>Adetogramma chrysolepis</h1>
<p>Adetogramma chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden-leaved staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant's leaves are covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores, which are released into the air for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adetogramma chrysolepis has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically light green, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adetogramma chrysolepis is primarily native to Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in high-altitude environments with temperate climates. The species is adapted to rocky and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic areas within South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adetogramma chrysolepis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed environments such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and can tolerate a range of soil types. Its introduction has been associated with its ability to colonize disturbed areas quickly, making it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems varies depending on the local environment and management practices.</p>
