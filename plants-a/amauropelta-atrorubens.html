<p>Amauropelta atrorubens, commonly known as the red-black fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that display a striking red and black coloration, particularly on the underside. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
