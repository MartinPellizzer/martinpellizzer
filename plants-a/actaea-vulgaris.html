                <h1>Actaea vulgaris</h1>
<p>Actaea vulgaris, commonly known as white baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces clusters of small, white, spiny berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and has a short stem with a single flower at the top. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine, though it is not recommended for modern therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its striking appearance and ecological significance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea vulgaris has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically 10–30 cm in length, with 5–11 lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth, slender, and usually reddish-brown, with a growth pattern that is upright and somewhat branched. Its flowers are white to pale green, clustered in an umbel, and bloom in late spring to early summer, being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate, containing numerous small seeds that are dispersed by birds eating the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and survive in shaded woodland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea vulgaris is primarily native to temperate regions of Europe, western Asia, and parts of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with forest understories. It is also known as the "Cimicifuga" or "Black cohosh" in some regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Russia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea vulgaris was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, especially in the eastern and central parts of the continent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into sensitive ecosystems.</p>
