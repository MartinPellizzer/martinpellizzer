<p>Aster alpigenus subsp.</p>
<p>haydenii, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with blue to purple petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>
