                        <h1>Acer semenovii</h1>
<p>Acer semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov maple, is a rare and lesser-known species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a striking red or orange hue during the autumn season. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer semenovii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
