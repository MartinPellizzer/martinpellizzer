                <h1>Adicea ternifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leafed adicea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adicea ternifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea ternifolia has trifoliate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its small, white to pink flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring four petals and five stamens, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ternifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found in dry, sunny areas. The plant is commonly associated with limestone soils and is frequently seen along cliffs and seaside cliffs. It is also present in some regions of southwestern Asia, such as Turkey and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ternifolia was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions outside its native range, particularly in temperate climates. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread in these areas. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
