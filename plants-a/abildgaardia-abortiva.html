                    <h1>Abildgaardia abortiva</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia abortiva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteridophyte, is a rare fern species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
