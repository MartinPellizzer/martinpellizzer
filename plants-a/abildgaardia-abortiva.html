                        <h1>Abildgaardia abortiva</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia abortiva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteridophyte, is a rare fern species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia abortiva is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape Province and parts of the Western Cape. This species thrives in coastal and sandy environments. It is commonly associated with dune ecosystems and is well adapted to sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its distinctive, often twisted leaves and is a member of the Aizoaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia abortiva was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it particularly problematic in forested regions.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
