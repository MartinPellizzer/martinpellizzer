<p>Alloplectus repens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Alloplectus repens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed habitats.</p>
