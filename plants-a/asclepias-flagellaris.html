<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain numerous tiny, hairy seeds attached to silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Asclepias flagellaris plays a vital role in supporting pollinators, including butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich blooms.</p>
