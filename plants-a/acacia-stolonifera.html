                    <h1>Acacia stolonifera</h1>
<p>Acacia stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody growth habit and the ability to form extensive mats through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically small, feathery, and arranged in spirals along the stems.</p>
<p>Acacia stolonifera is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use strategies.</p>
