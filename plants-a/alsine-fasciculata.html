                    <h1>Alsine fasciculata</h1>
<p>Alsine fasciculata, commonly known as clustered sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Alsine fasciculata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
