                    <h1>Alopecurus hordeiformis</h1>
<p>Alopecurus hordeiformis, commonly known as mouse barley, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are similar in appearance to barley grains, which contributes to its common name.</p>
<p>Alopecurus hordeiformis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
