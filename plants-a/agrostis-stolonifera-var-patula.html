The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and resilience make it a valuable species in various ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
