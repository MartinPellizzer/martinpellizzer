                <h1>Acrostichum humblotii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum humblotii, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum humblotii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and somewhat fibrous, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a creeping or clumping manner. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, with a greenish-white color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum humblotii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in coastal and riverine forests, where it adapts well to moist and shaded environments. Its natural range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>Acrostichum humblotii plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum humblotii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and marshy environments where it can tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding. This plant is often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ability to improve soil quality in degraded coastal areas.</p>
