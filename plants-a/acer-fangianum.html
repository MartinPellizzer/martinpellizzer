                <h1>Acer fangianum</h1>
<p>Acer fangianum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the autumn. It typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fangianum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning bright red in the autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and moderately deep, anchoring the tree in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fangianum is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate forests. This species grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Acer fangianum is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fangianum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer fangianum involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants like hostas or ferns.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fangianum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. Its extensive root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in forested areas. The tree also serves as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, promoting a balanced ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
