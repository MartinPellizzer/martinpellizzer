                    <h1>Acicarpha procumbens</h1>
<p>Acicarpha procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate acacia, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a feathery appearance, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acicarpha procumbens is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens.</p>
