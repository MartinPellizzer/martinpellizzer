                            <h1>Allium Lacteum</h1>
<p>Allium lacteum is a rare and fascinating plant known for its unique milky sap and delicate white flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments. This member of the onion family has been used in traditional medicine for centuries due to its purported health benefits. Its striking appearance makes it a sought-after addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Despite its beauty, Allium lacteum remains elusive and is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
