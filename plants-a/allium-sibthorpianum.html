                    <h1>Allium sibthorpianum</h1>
<p>Allium sibthorpianum, commonly known as the Sibthorp's garlic, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllis family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces a strong garlic-like odor when the leaves are crushed, which is due to sulfur compounds present in its tissues. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens in suitable climates.</p>
<p>Allium sibthorpianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators.</p>
