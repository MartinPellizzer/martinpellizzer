                <h1>Adenogramma capillaris</h1>
<p>Adenogramma capillaris, commonly known as the slender adenogramma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma capillaris has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures arranged in clusters, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma capillaris is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant species that occurs naturally in this region. The Cape Provinces are located in the southern part of Africa, specifically in South Africa. This plant is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma capillaris was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, small, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in regions with mild climates, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Australia. This plant is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens because of its low-growing habit and drought tolerance. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact in certain regions.</p>
