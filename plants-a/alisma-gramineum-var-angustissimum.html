<p>Alisma gramineum var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, with a smooth, waxy surface adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in shallow water and moist soils, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to other varieties of Alisma gramineum.</p>
