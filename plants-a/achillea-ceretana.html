                <h1>Achillea ceretana</h1>
<p>Achillea ceretana, commonly known as the Southern Yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, finely toothed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea ceretana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ceretana has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and attached pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ceretana is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It typically grows in dry, sunny areas with well-drained soil, often on cliffs or slopes. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea ceretana is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ceretana is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its vigor and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
