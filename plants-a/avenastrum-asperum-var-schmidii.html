                    <h1>Avenastrum asperum var. schmidii</h1>
<p>Avenastrum asperum var. schmidii, commonly known as the Schmid's rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned florets. It is adapted to poor, rocky soils and can withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded habitats.</p>
