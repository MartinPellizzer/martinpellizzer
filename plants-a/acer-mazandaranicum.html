                <h1>Acer mazandaranicum</h1>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum, commonly known as the Mazandaran maple, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring palmate leaves with five to seven lobes that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a desirable plant for horticultural use.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-9 cm long and are arranged singly along the branches. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum is a rare species native to the western part of the Caspian Sea region, primarily in the Iranian province of Mazandaran.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the northern mountains of Iran. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forested areas. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural range, Acer mazandaranicum is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seed propagation requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with a focus on establishing a strong root system in the first few years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and pruning is minimal, mainly to shape the tree and remove dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like verticillium wilt can be a concern; companion planting with lavender or sage can help deter pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its root system helps in erosion control by holding soil in place during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum is a species of maple native to the forests of Iran, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap and leaves have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it does not have a major commercial role. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in its native regions, representing natural beauty and ecological heritage.</p>
<p>Its role in environmental conservation highlights its importance in maintaining forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Gumpo', known for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth. Hybrids of Acer mazandaranicum are often developed to enhance hardiness and color display, making them suitable for a wider range of climates. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in urban and garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated for landscaping and ornamental purposes, contributing to the diversity of maple trees in horticulture.</p>
