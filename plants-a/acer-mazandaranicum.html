                <h1>Acer mazandaranicum</h1>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum, commonly known as the Mazandaran maple, is a deciduous tree native to the forests of northern Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light grey bark that peels in thin layers as the tree ages. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping anchor the plant in moist, temperate soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum is a rare species native to the western part of the Caspian Sea region, specifically in the Iranian province of Mazandaran.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now also found in parts of southern Russia and Turkey due to cultivation and introduction. This plant thrives in moist, temperate climates, typically growing in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly found at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer mazandaranicum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum is a decorative maple species known for its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. Common pests include aphids and scale, while diseases like powdery mildew may occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum is a deciduous tree that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting local biodiversity. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, offering shade and protection to smaller plants in the understory. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum is a species of maple native to the forests of Iran, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have limited traditional uses in local herbal remedies. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and crafts. Culturally, it holds significance in the regions where it grows, often symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity and providing habitat for wildlife also underscores its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer mazandaranicum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Sutherlandii', known for their striking foliage colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer mazandaranicum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and visual appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated for their aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions.</p>
