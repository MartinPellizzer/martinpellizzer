                <h1>Acrotrema agastyamalayanum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema agastyamalayanum, commonly known as the Malayan acrotrema, is a rare and lesser-known species of liverwort.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate thalloid structure and specialized reproductive features. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology includes a dorsiventral thallus with distinct leaf-like structures and a complex arrangement of reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema agastyamalayanum has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows in a compact, low shrub form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema agastyamalayanum is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within India, where the climate supports its growth.</p>
<p>It is a rare species, often found in isolated locations within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema agastyamalayanum was mainly introduced to areas with humid tropical climates, particularly in regions of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed habitats such as secondary forests, roadsides, and degraded lands. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including India, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is often associated with human activities, such as land clearing and urbanization, which create suitable conditions for its growth.</p>
