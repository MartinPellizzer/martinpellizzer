<p>Atriplex rosea subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called a bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its robust root system allows it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
