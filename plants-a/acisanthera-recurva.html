                <h1>Acisanthera recurva</h1>
<p>Acisanthera recurva, commonly known as the slender sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and hairy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acisanthera recurva is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera recurva has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera recurva is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly found in areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii and parts of the Philippines. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found along forest edges or in secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these geographic regions due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera recurva was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its unique, recurving leaves. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming established in several wetland and riparian habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ecological benefits, such as providing habitat for pollinators.</p>
