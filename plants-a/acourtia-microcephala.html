                <h1>Acourtia microcephala</h1>
<p>Acourtia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Acourtia microcephala is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia microcephala has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light gray bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia microcephala is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the coastal regions of California, particularly in the northern and central parts of the state. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline and in dunes. The species is also present in the northern regions of Mexico, where it grows in similar coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia microcephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, small, white flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in various habitats. The distribution of this plant is now widespread across the North Island, particularly in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems from its impact.</p>
