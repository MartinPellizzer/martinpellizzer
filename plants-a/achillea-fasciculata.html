                <h1>Achillea fasciculata</h1>
<p>Achillea fasciculata, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It features slender, aromatic leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Achillea fasciculata is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fasciculata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a basal rosette and reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, and it grows in a丛生 pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fasciculata is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California, Oregon, and Nevada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of North America, though it is less common outside its native range. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea fasciculata is listed as a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fasciculata is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of white or pink flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the roots in early spring or by sowing seeds directly into the garden in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, flowering in mid to late summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or rust, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter harmful pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea fasciculata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea fasciculata also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea fasciculata is a flowering plant commonly known as the yarrow plant, which has a variety of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is occasionally used to flavor dishes or as a seasoning due to its mild, aromatic properties.
