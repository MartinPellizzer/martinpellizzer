                <h1>Adicea cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forested areas.</p>
<p>Adicea cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea cuneifolia has leaves that are narrow and triangular in shape, with a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring around 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a bright green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender and erect, covered in a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, ranging in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea cuneifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant is commonly associated with rocky or clay soils and is often found along stream banks and in forest undergrowth. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>
<p>Adicea cuneifolia is not widely distributed beyond its native range and is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea cuneifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European flora introduced for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It has since become naturalized in several regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species.</p>
