                    <h1>Achyrophorus sessiliflorus var. barbatus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus sessiliflorus var. barbatus, commonly known as the barbed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to harsh desert environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
