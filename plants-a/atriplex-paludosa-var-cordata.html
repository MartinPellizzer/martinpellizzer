                    <h1>Atriplex paludosa var. cordata</h1>
<p>Atriplex paludosa var. cordata, commonly known as the cordate saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to wetland and marshy areas of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically heart-shaped, giving it its botanical name. The plant thrives in saline or alkaline soils and is often found in coastal regions or inland wetlands. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other members of the Atriplex genus, which are known for their adaptability to harsh, arid conditions.</p>
