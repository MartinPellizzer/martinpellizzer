                    <h1>Acacia heteracantha</h1>
<p>Acacia heteracantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a woody pod, which splits open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Acacia heteracantha is adapted to arid environments and is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
