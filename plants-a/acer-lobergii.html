                <h1>Acer lobergii</h1>
<p>Acer lobergii, commonly known as the Loberg maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a maple-like shape, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two wings that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China, specifically in the provinces of Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Although it was once found in parts of Vietnam, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in China. It thrives in temperate forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, Acer lobergii is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with seedlings requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This slow-growing plant typically enters a dormant phase in winter, with new growth emerging in early spring and lasting through late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove any dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. Its dense root system acts as an effective erosion control agent, stabilizing soil in riparian areas. The tree also serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii is a rare maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value in horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves have been traditionally used in some folk remedies for their potential medicinal properties. It has limited industrial applications but contributes to ecological diversity and supports local wildlife. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic significance in traditional Chinese botany and landscape design.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains in botanical study and ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Garnet Beauty,' which are known for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also the parent species of several hybrids, such as Acer x carpinifolium, which combines the traits of Acer lobergii with those of other maple species. These hybrids are often used in horticulture for their improved hardiness and enhanced foliage characteristics. The plant's unique foliage and adaptability make it a valuable addition to garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its role as a parent in breeding programs aimed at developing new, more resilient maple varieties.</p>
