                    <h1>Acer lobergii</h1>
<p>Acer lobergii, commonly known as the Loberg maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.</p>
