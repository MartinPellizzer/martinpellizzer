                <h1>Acer lobergii</h1>
<p>Acer lobergii, commonly known as the Loberg maple, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape specimen.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta around the world, though it remains uncommon in the wild. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests. This species grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, Acer lobergii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii is a compact maple species known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer lobergii includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of leaf color change in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with partial shade to full sun, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and provides nectar and pollen throughout the growing season. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats for insects and fungi. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lobergii contributes to ecological balance by improving soil quality and supporting a diverse range of life forms in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii is a rare maple species primarily valued for its ornamental beauty, making it a popular choice for landscaping and horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor uses in traditional herbal remedies. In industrial contexts, its wood is not commonly utilized due to its limited availability and hardiness. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it grows, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its main applications lie in ecological and aesthetic roles rather than economic or medicinal industries.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobergii has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that contribute to its horticultural appeal.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Ludlowii' and 'Sutherlandii', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit. The species is also frequently hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, resulting in ornamental varieties that exhibit enhanced coloration and adaptability. These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in gardens for their ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in various climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer lobergii plays a significant role in the world of horticulture due to its aesthetic value and genetic versatility.</p>
