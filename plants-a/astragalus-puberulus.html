<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus puberulus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
