                    <h1>Alberta sambiranensis var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Alberta sambiranensis var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf albertia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a coarse, textured surface, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
