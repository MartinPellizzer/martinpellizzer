                    <h1>Andreoskia parviflora</h1>
<p>Andreoskia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
