                    <h1>Agrostis miliacea</h1>
<p>Agrostis miliacea, commonly known as millet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open areas such as meadows, fields, and along roadsides, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Agrostis miliacea is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
