<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces spiky, bristly seed pods that contain numerous small seeds, aiding in its dispersal by wind and animals. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color.</p>
<p>Arctium alpinum is often found in dry meadows, rocky soils, and alpine environments where it thrives in cooler climates.</p>
