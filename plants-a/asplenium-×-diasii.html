                    <h1>Asplenium × diasii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × diasii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact rosette, typically with a dark green to blackish coloration. The plant lacks true roots and relies on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption, which is a common trait among ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
