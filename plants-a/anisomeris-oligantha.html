                    <h1>Anisomeris oligantha</h1>
<p>Anisomeris oligantha, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, a key adaptation for survival in drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse via the wind. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Anisomeris oligantha is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
