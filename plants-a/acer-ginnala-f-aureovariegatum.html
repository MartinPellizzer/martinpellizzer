<p>Acer ginnala f. aureovariegatum, commonly known as the golden variegated maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that display striking variegation of yellow, white, and green. The plant produces small, red or orange flowers in spring, followed by winged seeds in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is valued for its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various garden environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. aureovariegatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a vibrant yellow-green variegation pattern on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in panicles, with greenish-white petals, blooming in early spring and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. aureovariegatum is a cultivar of the five-leaf maple, native to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>While it originally came from China, it is now widely cultivated in gardens and parks across North America and Europe. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in forested areas. It typically grows at low to mid-altitudes, ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations are limited, and its conservation status is considered stable due to its cultivation and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. aureovariegatum is a decorative tree known for its vibrant yellow variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining variegation. The tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 10-15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials such as hostas can enhance its ornamental appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. aureovariegatum is a striking ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy yellow foliage attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, complementing other flora with its vibrant colors and seasonal interest. Additionally, its shallow root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to improving air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.</p>
