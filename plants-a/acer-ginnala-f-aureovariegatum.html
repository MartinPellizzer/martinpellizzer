                    <h1>Acer ginnala f. aureovariegatum</h1>
<p>Acer ginnala f. aureovariegatum, commonly known as the golden variegated horse chestnut, is a variant of the horse chestnut tree characterized by its striking variegated leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright yellow and white, with a green margin, creating a visually appealing contrast. This plant is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It produces large, showy white flowers in the spring, followed by spiny capsules containing glossy, chestnut-like seeds.</p>
<p>The variegation in its foliage is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, making it a popular choice for gardens and public landscapes.</p>
