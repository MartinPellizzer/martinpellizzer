                    <h1>Allium nemorale</h1>
<p>Allium nemorale, commonly known as the woodland garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the woodlands of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous underground stems store nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Allium nemorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
