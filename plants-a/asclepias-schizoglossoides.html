                    <h1>Asclepias schizoglossoides</h1>
<p>Asclepias schizoglossoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed species are notable for their role in supporting monarch butterfly populations, as they serve as a host plant for monarch caterpillars.</p>
<p>The plant also contains latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
