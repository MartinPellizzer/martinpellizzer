                    <h1>Acacia barrancana</h1>
<p>Acacia barrancana, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia barrancana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
