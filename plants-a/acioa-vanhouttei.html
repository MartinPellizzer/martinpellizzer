<p>Acioa vanhouttei, commonly known as the Vanhoutte's acacia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>
