                <h1>Adonis marginata</h1>
<p>Adonis marginata, commonly known as the Alpine Adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and are often visited by bees and other pollinators.</p>
<p>Adonis marginata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis marginata has alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are bright green and up to 5 cm in length, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are yellow, tubular, and clustered in umbels, blooming in spring and attracting insects through nectar, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis marginata is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, grasslands, and rocky soils. This plant thrives in mild, temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Adonis marginata is an important part of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis marginata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
