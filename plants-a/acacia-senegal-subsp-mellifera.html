                        <h1>Acacia senegal subsp. mellifera</h1>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera, commonly known as the gum arabic acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing a sticky, resinous substance called gum arabic. This resin is harvested for use in food, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera is primarily native to the Sahel region of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Niger, Chad, and Mali. It thrives in semi-arid and arid environments, often found in savannas and dry woodlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to hot, dry climates with seasonal rainfall. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is used locally for its gum arabic production and traditional medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera was mainly introduced to support local economies through the production of gum arabic, which is highly valued in food, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, making it a key species for reforestation and land rehabilitation efforts in areas with poor soil quality.</p>
<p>The plant is also utilized for its timber, which is durable and suitable for construction and furniture-making. Its introduction has helped improve soil stability and reduce erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its spread has sometimes led to competition with native vegetation, requiring careful management to balance ecological and economic benefits.</p>
