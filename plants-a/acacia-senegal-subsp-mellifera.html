                <h1>Acacia senegal subsp. mellifera</h1>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera, commonly known as the gum arabic acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, bipinnate leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for producing a high-quality gum arabic, which is harvested from its bark. It thrives in semi-arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in both ecological and economic contexts in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measuring about 2–5 cm in length, with a pale green color. The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in globular heads, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, allowing the plant to access water from deeper soil layers, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera is a shrub native to the Sahel region of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Chad, Niger, and Mali. Its current distribution extends across parts of the Sahara and into the semi-arid savannas of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with hot, dry climates and well-drained sandy or loamy soils. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable, though it remains relatively common in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera is a resilient tree native to arid and semi-arid regions, known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions. It is commonly propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seedlings requiring well-drained soil and moderate watering during establishment.</p>
<p>The growth cycle includes a slow initial phase followed by rapid growth once the plant is established, typically reaching maturity in 5–10 years. Fertilization with a balanced mineral mix and regular pruning to shape the tree and promote healthy growth are essential for optimal development.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale insects or fungal issues in overly wet conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with legumes to enhance nitrogen fixation in the soil.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and birds. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a natural erosion control agent due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil in arid environments. It also serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil fertility and supporting other plant growth.</p>
<p>Additionally, its gum arabic production offers economic benefits to local communities while maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera is a valuable plant with diverse uses across various fields. It is used in culinary applications, where its gum arabic is a key ingredient in food products such as confections, beverages, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Medicinally, the plant has been traditionally used to treat ailments like diarrhea, inflammation, and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Industrially, its gum arabic is widely used in the production of adhesives, coatings, and as a stabilizer in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, contributing significantly to the economy of many African countries.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some communities and is often used in rituals and traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>mellifera has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value and adaptability, including 'Bilimbi' and 'White Acacia.'. These cultivars are often selected for their unique foliage and floral characteristics.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this species are occasionally developed to enhance traits such as drought resistance and growth habit. Horticulturally, it is valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its use in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it an important plant in both ecological and ornamental horticulture.</p>
