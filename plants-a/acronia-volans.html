                <h1>Acronia volans</h1>
<p>Acronia volans, commonly known as the flying acronia, is a unique plant species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of rainforests. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of aerial roots, which help it climb and anchor itself to trees.</p>
<p>Acronia volans plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insect species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia volans has leaves that are oval-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a climbing pattern, often winding around supports. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia volans is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories where it thrives in the humid climate. This plant is also present in parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and Belize. It prefers well-drained soil and is often seen growing near streams or in rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become more restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia volans was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lots.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant has shown rapid growth and spread, often outcompeting native species in invaded areas. Its introduction has been linked to human activities, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in several regions where it has established itself.</p>
