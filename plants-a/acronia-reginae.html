<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia reginae has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright with a smooth, light green bark.
