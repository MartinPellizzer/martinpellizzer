<p>Acronia reginae, commonly known as the royal acronia, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, pink, and white.
