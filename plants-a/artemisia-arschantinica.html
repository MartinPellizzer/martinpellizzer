                    <h1>Artemisia arschantinica</h1>
<p>Artemisia arschantinica, commonly known as the Armenian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia arschantinica is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thujone and camphor, have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
