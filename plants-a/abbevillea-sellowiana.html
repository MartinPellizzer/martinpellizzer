<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Abbevillea sellowiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abbevillea sellowiana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 3 to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abbevillea sellowiana is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of southern Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of neighboring regions in southeastern Brazil, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical rainforests. Abbevillea sellowiana is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abbevillea sellowiana is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Abbevillea sellowiana involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote blooming.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by aphids or fungal infections, and it pairs well with other native plants in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
