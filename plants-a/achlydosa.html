                    <h1>Achlydosa</h1>
<p>Achlydosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in specific, moist, acidic pine rockland habitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Achlydosa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
