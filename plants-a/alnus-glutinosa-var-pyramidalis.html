                    <h1>Alnus glutinosa var. pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Alnus glutinosa var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
