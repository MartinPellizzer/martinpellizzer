                <h1>Achillea stricta</h1>
<p>Achillea stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine is linked to its ability to promote wound healing and reduce inflammation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea stricta has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette with a bluish-green color and a silvery-white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads composed of many tiny florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea stricta is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with disturbed or marginal areas. Its distribution extends into the Middle East and some areas of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea stricta was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant spreads rapidly through rhizomes, making it effective for land stabilization. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had both positive and negative ecological impacts depending on the environment.</p>
