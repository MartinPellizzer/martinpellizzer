<p>Achimenes grandiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes grandiflora has heart-shaped, velvety, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement and range from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>Its stems are erect, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. The flowers are showy, tubular, and borne in clusters, with vibrant red or pink petals that bloom from summer to autumn, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes grandiflora is a tropical plant native to the Andes mountains of South America, particularly in countries like Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>While it was once found in its native range, it is now primarily cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens around the world. It thrives in humid, shady environments with well-drained soil, typically found in cloud forests. This species grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as vulnerable in some regions, though its conservation status varies depending on local populations.</p>
