                <h1>Adiantum extensum</h1>
<p>Adiantum extensum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only roots and the second year forming the fern structure. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum extensum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shade gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum extensum has fern-like leaves that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a narrow, lance-shaped structure, and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The stems are slender, creeping, and often have a light brown, smooth bark that grows along the ground. Adiantum extensum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum extensum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and rocky outcrops. This fern thrives in regions with cool, humid climates and is often associated with deciduous forests. Its range extends from the northeastern United States down to the southeastern states.</p>
<p>It is also present in some areas of southern Ontario and Quebec in Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum extensum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern has become naturalized in several areas, often growing along the edges of water bodies. Its delicate, lace-like fronds make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
