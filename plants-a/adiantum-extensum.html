<p>Adiantum extensum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only roots and the second year forming the fern structure. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum extensum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shade gardens.</p>
