                    <h1>Astragalus maximus var. dasysemius</h1>
<p>Astragalus maximus var. dasysemius, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in umbel-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
