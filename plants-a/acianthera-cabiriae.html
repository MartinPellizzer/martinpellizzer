                <h1>Acianthera cabiriae</h1>
<p>Acianthera cabiriae, commonly known as the Cabiria orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and produces flowering stems with clustered, showy flowers. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Acianthera cabiriae is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera cabiriae has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 3 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring tubular petals with a white to pale pink color, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera cabiriae is primarily native to Costa Rica.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical rainforests of the country, particularly in the northern and central regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with cloud forests and is part of the diverse flora of Costa Rica's biodiversity hotspots.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera cabiriae was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and greenhouses. This plant is often introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive flowers and ease of care. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
