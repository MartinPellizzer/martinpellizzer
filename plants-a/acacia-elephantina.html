<p>Acacia elephantina, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of long, thin branches that provide shade and shelter. The plant has small, feathery leaves and produces yellow flowers that attract various pollinators. Its thorny stems and branches make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Acacia elephantina is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
