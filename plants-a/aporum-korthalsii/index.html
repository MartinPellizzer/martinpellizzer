                            <h1>Aporum Korthalsii</h1>
<p>Aporum korthalsii is a striking member of the Araliaceae family known for its dramatic, umbrella-like foliage. Native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil, this plant thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its large, dark green leaves can grow up to three feet in diameter, making it a focal point in any indoor space. Often mistaken for a tree due to its size, it is actually a compact shrub that requires careful pruning to maintain shape. This plant is popular among plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
