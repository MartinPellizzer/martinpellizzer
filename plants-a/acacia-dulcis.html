                        <h1>Acacia dulcis</h1>
<p>Acacia dulcis, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces flat, compound leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Acacia dulcis is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of gum arabic.</p>
