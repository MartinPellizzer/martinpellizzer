                    <h1>Acridocarpus glaucescens var. graniticus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens var. graniticus, commonly known as the granite acacia, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky or granitic substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
