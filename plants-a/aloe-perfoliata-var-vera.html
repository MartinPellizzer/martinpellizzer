                    <h1>Aloe perfoliata var. vera</h1>
<p>Aloe perfoliata var. vera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers on erect, branched stems, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its adaptability and unique morphology.</p>
