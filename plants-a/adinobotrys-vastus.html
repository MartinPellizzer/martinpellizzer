                <h1>Adinobotrys vastus</h1>
<p>Adinobotrys vastus, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to saline soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys vastus has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys vastus is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing as an understory plant. The plant is known for its distinctive flowers and is part of the Sapindaceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and eastern parts of Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys vastus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and horticultural practices.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its ability to spread rapidly has led to its establishment in multiple regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
