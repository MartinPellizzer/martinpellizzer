                <h1>Actinella chrysanthemoides</h1>
<p>Actinella chrysanthemoides, commonly known as the Chinese chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The flowers are composed of ray florets and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella chrysanthemoides has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a central disk, blooming in the spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella chrysanthemoides is primarily native to China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these countries. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with forested areas and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to East Asia, where it grows naturally in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella chrysanthemoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant is now found throughout much of the North Island and parts of the South Island.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
