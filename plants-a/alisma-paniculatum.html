                    <h1>Alisma paniculatum</h1>
<p>Alisma paniculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in an erect paniculate inflorescence, which emerges above the water surface. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Alisma paniculatum thrives in shallow water and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
