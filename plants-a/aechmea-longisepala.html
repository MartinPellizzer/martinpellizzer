<p>Aechmea longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepal aechmea, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from red to orange. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention.</p>
