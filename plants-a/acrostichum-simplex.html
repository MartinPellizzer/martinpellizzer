                <h1>Acrostichum simplex</h1>
<p>Acrostichum simplex, commonly known as the common brake, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum simplex plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum simplex has large, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a light green bark that remains smooth as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a round, dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum simplex is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands, where it thrives in humid, saline environments. This plant is particularly associated with mangrove ecosystems and estuaries along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Its distribution extends from Mexico through northern South America to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is also present in some regions of Southeast Asia, though its primary range remains in the Americas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum simplex was mainly introduced to disturbed coastal areas and wetlands where it can thrive in saline and brackish conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and parts of the United States. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>It often outcompetes native vegetation, altering local ecosystems.</p>
