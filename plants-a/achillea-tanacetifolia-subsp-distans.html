                <h1>Achillea tanacetifolia subsp. distans</h1>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia subsp.</p>
<p>distans, commonly known as the distant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant and ornamental plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia subsp.</p>
<p>distans has leaves that are narrow, linear, and serrated, with a silvery-white underside and a dark green upper surface; they are arranged alternately along the stem and are typically 5â€“15 cm long. The stem is upright, slender, and hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia subsp.</p>
<p>distans is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. Its current distribution includes areas in the Mediterranean basin, where it has been introduced in some regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often found on slopes and in open woodlands. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of low conservation concern due to its ability to persist in its native habitats despite some local habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia subsp.</p>
<p>distans is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and daisy-like flowers, commonly used in gardens for its ornamental value. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
