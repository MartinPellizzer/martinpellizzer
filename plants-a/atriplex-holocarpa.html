                    <h1>Atriplex holocarpa</h1>
<p>Atriplex holocarpa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex holocarpa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
