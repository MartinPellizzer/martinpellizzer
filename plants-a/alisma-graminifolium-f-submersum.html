                    <h1>Alisma graminifolium f. submersum</h1>
<p>Alisma graminifolium f. submersum, commonly known as the submerged arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant adapted to aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are fully submerged in water, aiding in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are often submerged or just at the water's surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies exhibits specialized morphological adaptations to thrive in submerged conditions, making it a unique example of aquatic plant evolution.</p>
