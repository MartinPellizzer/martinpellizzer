<p>Aubrieta intermedia subsp.</p>
<p>falcata, commonly known as the alpine aubrieta, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant features fuzzy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in cool climates.</p>
