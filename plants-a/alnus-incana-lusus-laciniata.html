<p>Alnus incana lusus laciniata, commonly known as the silky alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, gray-green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Its root system has the ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
