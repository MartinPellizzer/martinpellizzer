<p>Arenaria tetraquetra var. condensata, commonly known as the dense sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with closely packed leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize itself in loose, nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to cold and drought conditions.</p>
