                <h1>Acrostichum laciniatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum laciniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows along the edges of swamps and wetlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a prominent central stamen.</p>
<p>Acrostichum laciniatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum laciniatum has large, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green color and a pinnate arrangement.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically long and narrow, reaching up to 1 meter in length, and have a glossy surface. The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fibrous bark that is usually a light brown color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, blooming in the spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing structure, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, with roots that are fibrous and well-developed for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum laciniatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other moist, saline environments. This plant thrives in humid climates with high salinity levels, often growing near the coastlines of countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. It is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to its ability to tolerate saltwater and fluctuating environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum laciniatum was mainly introduced to wetlands and disturbed areas along the southeastern coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal marshes, tidal flats, and other moist environments where it can thrive in saline or brackish conditions. This plant has become established in several states, including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation, altering the ecological balance of the habitats it colonizes.</p>
