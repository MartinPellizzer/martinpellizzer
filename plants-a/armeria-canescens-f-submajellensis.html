                    <h1>Armeria canescens f. submajellensis</h1>
<p>Armeria canescens f. submajellensis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture and resist harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky coastal areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
