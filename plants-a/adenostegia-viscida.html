                <h1>Adenostegia viscida</h1>
<p>Adenostegia viscida, commonly known as the sticky leaf daisy, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with yellow centers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Adenostegia viscida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia viscida has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia viscida is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones along the Pacific coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia viscida was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy environments where it forms dense mats. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, its rapid growth can lead to competition with native species.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
