<p>Andropogon sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family, which includes many economically important grasses.</p>
