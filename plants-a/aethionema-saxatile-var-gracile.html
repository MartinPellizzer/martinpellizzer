                    <h1>Aethionema saxatile var. gracile</h1>
<p>Aethionema saxatile var. gracile, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in dry, limestone soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a slightly succulent texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions.</p>
