                <h1>Adonis coriacea</h1>
<p>Adonis coriacea, commonly known as the rough adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Adonis coriacea is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis coriacea has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis coriacea is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, and parts of Greece.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, particularly in regions like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in rocky and mountainous areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments. It is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates and can be found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of the Mediterranean basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis coriacea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several countries across Europe and parts of North America. Its introduction is often associated with human activities, including agriculture and landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
