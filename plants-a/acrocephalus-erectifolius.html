                <h1>Acrocephalus erectifolius</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus erectifolius, commonly known as the upright-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus erectifolius has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 10 to 20 cm in length with a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences, composed of small, greenish-white florets that bloom from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus erectifolius is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is also present in some parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with stable water sources and rich organic soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus erectifolius was mainly introduced to areas with wetland habitats, particularly in regions with shallow water and muddy soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant is often found in temperate and subtropical regions where there is consistent moisture availability. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an important component of aquatic ecosystems in many parts of the world.</p>
