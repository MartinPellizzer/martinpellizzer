                <h1>Aegiphila exiguiflora</h1>
<p>Aegiphila exiguiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white in color. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila exiguiflora has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-white underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow, consisting of five petals and five sepals, and bloom during the dry season, likely relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>
