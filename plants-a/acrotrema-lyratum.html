                <h1>Acrotrema lyratum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema lyratum, commonly known as the lyrate acrotrema, is a small flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially threatened species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema lyratum has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green color and a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a pale yellow color and a simple structure, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the pod dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema lyratum is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in forested areas. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island's biodiversity-rich habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema lyratum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has spread across various regions, particularly in temperate climates, due to its adaptability. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
