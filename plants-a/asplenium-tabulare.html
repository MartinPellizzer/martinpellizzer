<p>Asplenium tabulare, commonly known as the shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium tabulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
