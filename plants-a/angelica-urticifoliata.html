                    <h1>Angelica urticifoliata</h1>
<p>Angelica urticifoliata, commonly known as the stinging angelica, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which develop into dark brown berries. Its leaves and stems contain irritant chemicals, such as calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive properties, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
