                <h1>Adenosacme macrostachya</h1>
<p>Adenosacme macrostachya, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme macrostachya has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme macrostachya is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests where it grows as an undergrowth plant. The species is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and high rainfall. It is often associated with secondary forest growth and can be seen in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions, making it a regionally significant plant in the Neotropical biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme macrostachya was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily spread through human activities such as landscaping and gardening. This plant has become established in moist, disturbed areas like riverbanks and wetlands. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
