                <h1>Aechmea glandulosa</h1>
<p>Aechmea glandulosa, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically broad, fleshy, and covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes that give the plant its velvety appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea glandulosa has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and sword-like, arranged in a dense spiral at the base, with a dark green to blue-gray color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, fibrous caudex that is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a rough, hairy appearance. Its inflorescence is a tall, erect spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for water storage, helping the plant survive in its tropical, often arid habitat.</p>
