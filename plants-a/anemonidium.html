                    <h1>Anemonidium</h1>
<p>Anemonidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring pale green or white flowers that resemble orchids. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical classification places it within the family Orchidaceae, highlighting its evolutionary relationship to other orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Anemonidium is considered endangered and is often protected in its native environments.</p>
