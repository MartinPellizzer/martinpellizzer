                    <h1>Acanthophyllum cyrtostegium</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum cyrtostegium, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its structure provides habitat for small animals and insects, contributing to the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
