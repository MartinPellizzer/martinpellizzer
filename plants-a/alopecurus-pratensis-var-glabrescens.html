<p>Alopecurus pratensis var. glabrescens, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
