<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica var. gracilens is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions in Florida, particularly in the central and southern parts of the state. It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, often in disturbed or riparian habitats. This species typically grows at low elevations, usually below 30 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of concern, with its conservation status classified as vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica var. gracilens is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, showy bracts and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to maintain shape and promote bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
