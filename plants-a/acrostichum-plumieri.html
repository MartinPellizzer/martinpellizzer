                <h1>Acrostichum plumieri</h1>
<p>Acrostichum plumieri, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces showy yellow flowers with red stamens, which bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Acrostichum plumieri is often found in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum plumieri has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated and dark green, with a smooth texture and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is sturdy and slightly woody with a rough, fibrous bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum plumieri is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other moist, saline environments. This plant thrives in brackish water and can tolerate varying salinity levels. It is often associated with estuaries and tidal flats where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from the Caribbean to northern Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum plumieri was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it a common sight in marshes and tidal zones. This plant is often found growing along the edges of saltwater bodies, where it helps stabilize the soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its introduction has been both natural and intentional, with some populations established through seed dispersal by water or human activity.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native vegetation in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
