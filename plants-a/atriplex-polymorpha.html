                    <h1>Atriplex polymorpha</h1>
<p>Atriplex polymorpha, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Atriplex polymorpha is also known for its ability to accumulate salts in its tissues, a trait that aids in its survival in saline soils.</p>
