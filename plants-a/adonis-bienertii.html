                <h1>Adonis bienertii</h1>
<p>Adonis bienertii, commonly known as the mountain adonis, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, follicle-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Adonis bienertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis bienertii has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they are relatively small, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and has a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark, growing in a single, upright direction. The flowers are yellow, with a distinctive cup-like structure and five petals, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis bienertii is primarily native to the western Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and Morocco.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and calcareous soils, often growing in mountainous areas and along coastal cliffs. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant characteristics. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Adonis bienertii is known for its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis bienertii was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the western United States, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open forests, and meadows. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a range of soil types have contributed to its successful establishment in new environments. It is considered a non-native invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native plant communities.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
