                <h1>Aconitum helenae</h1>
<p>Aconitum helenae, commonly known as Helen's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aconitum helenae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>It is also noted for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum helenae has leaves that are compound, with palmate lobes that are deeply divided, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 10 to 20 cm in diameter, displaying a vibrant green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a solitary or clustered pattern. Its flowers are showy, consisting of five petal-like sepals and two smaller petals, with a striking blue-violet color, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum helenae is primarily native to Sakhalin.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the island, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with forested areas and rocky slopes. The species is part of the buttercup family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum helenae was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-purple flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and parts of the eastern United States. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its toxicity and potential to invade native habitats. The plant's distribution has been largely limited to areas with suitable soil and moisture conditions, though it has shown some spread beyond its original cultivation sites.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and the need for careful management in natural areas.</p>
