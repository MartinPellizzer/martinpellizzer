                <h1>Actinodaphne molochina</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne molochina, commonly known as the Moluccan laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its bark is smooth and often has a distinct aromatic scent, while its leaves are glossy and lance-shaped.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, contributing to its ecological importance in tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne molochina has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth, yellow drupe that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne molochina is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the wet zone. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific ecological conditions present in Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne molochina was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and as a hedge due to its dense foliage and attractive appearance. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, raising concerns about its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered a major threat to native ecosystems.</p>
