<p>Anacampseros nitida, commonly known as the slender ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, usually in spring or summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
