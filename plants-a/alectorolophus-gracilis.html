                    <h1>Alectorolophus gracilis</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus gracilis, commonly known as the slender-winged fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically slender and gracefully arching. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are small and clustered near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alectorolophus gracilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
