                    <h1>Argythamnia pilosistyla</h1>
<p>Argythamnia pilosistyla, commonly known as the silky leaf desert bush, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
