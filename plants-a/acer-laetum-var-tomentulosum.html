<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, grayish-green leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a slightly flaky texture.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments.</p>
