                    <h1>Aotus subspinescens</h1>
<p>Aotus subspinescens, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically white or violet, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both animals and humans.</p>
