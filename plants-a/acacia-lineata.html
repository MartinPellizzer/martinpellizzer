                <h1>Acacia lineata</h1>
<p>Acacia lineata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia lineata thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia lineata has leaves that are narrow, linear, and often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its yellow flowers are clustered in cylindrical spikes, with small, petal-less structures that rely on wind pollination, and they typically bloom during the dry season. The fruit is a flattened pod that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lineata is a shrub native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries such as Namibia, Angola, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of eastern and southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It typically grows in open woodlands, rocky outcrops, and savannas, often on well-drained soils. Acacia lineata is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its habitat is increasingly fragmented due to human activities and land-use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia lineata is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Australia, known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for optimal germination. The plant grows best in full sun and has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 3â€“5 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced fertilizer in spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sage can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia lineata is a versatile plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and benefiting surrounding vegetation. It also serves as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important component of stabilizing landscapes.</p>
