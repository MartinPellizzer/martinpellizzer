                <h1>Acmena ovata</h1>
<p>Acmena ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaved acmena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sterculiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and typically have a yellow or greenish hue.</p>
<p>Acmena ovata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena ovata has leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena ovata is primarily native to northeastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with coastal and inland rainforest areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is an evergreen shrub or small tree that plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Acmena ovata is also known by the common name 'Bottlebrush' due to its distinctive floral structure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena ovata was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native areas, sometimes becoming invasive. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for agricultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
