                    <h1>Arctium × dualis</h1>
<p>Arctium × dualis, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arctium lappa and Arctium tomentosum.</p>
<p>It is a biennial plant that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of purple to brown flowers in its second year, which are followed by spiny, burr-like seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its phototoxic sap, it can cause severe skin irritation and is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
