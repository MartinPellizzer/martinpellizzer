                    <h1>Azorella selago</h1>
<p>Azorella selago, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, cushion-shaped structure composed of tightly packed foliage. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Azorella selago is well adapted to cold, dry conditions and is often found in rocky or barren landscapes.</p>
