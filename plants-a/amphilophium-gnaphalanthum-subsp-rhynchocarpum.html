<p>Amphilophium gnaphalanthum subsp.</p>
<p>rhynchocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed woollyweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in well-drained soils, and it often forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation strategies and role in local ecosystems.</p>
