                    <h1>Aegilops variabilis var. peregrina</h1>
<p>Aegilops variabilis var. peregrina, commonly known as the wandering wheat, is a wild grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in crop improvement and biodiversity conservation.</p>
