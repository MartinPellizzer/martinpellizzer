                <h1>Adorium lucidum</h1>
<p>Adorium lucidum, commonly known as the crystal spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent leaves that refract light, giving it a shimmering appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only during the early morning hours. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique botanical features, it is considered a subject of scientific interest and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adorium lucidum has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adorium lucidum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich organic soil, often found along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. This plant is commonly encountered in lowland and montane forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions due to its sensitivity to environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adorium lucidum was mainly introduced to areas with high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil, typically in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with mild winters and warm summers, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The plant is often cultivated in coastal areas due to its tolerance for salt spray and wind. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional planting by gardeners.</p>
<p>However, it has also shown adaptability to urban environments, where it can colonize disturbed soils and rocky outcrops.</p>
