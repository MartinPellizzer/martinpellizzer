                    <h1>Aegilops longissima var. mutica</h1>
<p>Aegilops longissima var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender spikes and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential use in crop improvement.</p>
