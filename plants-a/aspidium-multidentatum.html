<p>Aspidium multidentatum, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense mats on the water surface. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are typically covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium multidentatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
