                        <h1>Acantholimon spirizianum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon spirizianum, commonly known as the spiral-leaved stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial succulent with a rosette-forming growth habit, characterized by its fleshy, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique spiral arrangement of leaves and ornamental flowers make it a distinctive addition to alpine and desert landscapes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex cellular structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, which consists of flowering plants often with specialized adaptations to arid environments, including some with colorful flowers. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, characterized by their often blue or purple flowers and medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid or rocky habitats, known for their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon spirizianum, a specific type within the genus Acantholimon, native to certain regions and distinguished by its unique morphological features.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon spirizianum is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern regions of the country, particularly in the Taurus Mountains. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in open grasslands. It is adapted to the dry and harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Turkey, making it a regionally significant species.</p>
