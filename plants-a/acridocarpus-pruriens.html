                <h1>Acridocarpus pruriens</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens, commonly known as the itching bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and rough, often hairy leaves that can cause skin irritation. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in lowland forests and is often seen growing near the forest floor or in open grasslands. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across parts of Africa and the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a forage plant in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded forests. The plant has become invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its hardy nature.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
