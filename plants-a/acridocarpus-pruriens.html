                <h1>Acridocarpus pruriens</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens, commonly known as the itching bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant is notable for its hairy leaves and stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potential irritant properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions of tropical Asia, where it has been introduced in some areas outside its native range. It thrives in moist, tropical environments, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is currently listed as vulnerable in some regions, though its conservation status varies across its range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens is a tropical plant known for its medicinal and ornamental value, commonly cultivated in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help repel pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pruriens is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Its deep roots help in erosion control by stabilizing soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and supporting sustainable land use.</p>
