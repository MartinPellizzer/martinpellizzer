                    <h1>Agrostis clavata</h1>
<p>Agrostis clavata, commonly known as the clustered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on rocky or dry soils, often found in alpine or coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Agrostis clavata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
