<p>Aponogeton hereroensis, commonly known as the Herero water arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that often root in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically submerged, though they may occasionally emerge above the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Aponogeton hereroensis is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ease of care.</p>
