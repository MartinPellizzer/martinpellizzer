                    <h1>Arum maculatum</h1>
<p>Arum maculatum, commonly known as the lords and ladies, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive arrow-shaped leaf with a reddish-purple underside, and a spadix surrounded by a showy, spathaceous bract. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered on the spadix. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Arum maculatum is known for its toxic properties, particularly in its berries and rhizomes, which contain calcium oxalate crystals.</p>
