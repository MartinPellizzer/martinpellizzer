                    <h1>Arthrosolen foliosus</h1>
<p>Arthrosolen foliosus, commonly known as the leafy moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, overlapping leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces spore capsules that are stalked and often covered in a protective sheath. Arthrosolen foliosus is often found growing on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and low-growing habit make it a common component of forest floor ecosystems.</p>
