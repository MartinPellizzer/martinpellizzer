                <h1>Adenostemma macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is typical of the milkweed genus, which can be toxic to some animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Adenostemma macrophyllum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma macrophyllum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually 5-10 cm long, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals that bloom from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma macrophyllum is primarily native to Bangladesh, Malaya, New Guinea, Queensland, and the West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. The species is known for its distinctive floral structure and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its native distribution highlights its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions across Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma macrophyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open habitats. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
