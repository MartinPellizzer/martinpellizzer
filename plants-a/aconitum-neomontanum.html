                <h1>Aconitum neomontanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum neomontanum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple hood-shaped flowers. The plant features large, deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Aconitum neomontanum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is also noted for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum neomontanum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically reaching up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>Its stem is erect, smooth, and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. The flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense, spikelike inflorescences, with showy, spurred petals and a short blooming period in late summer to early autumn, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, often forming a dense network that helps the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum neomontanum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges. It prefers well-drained soils and is typically found at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum neomontanum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and parts of the northeastern United States. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes and seeds, making it difficult to control once established.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental species.</p>
