<p>Arequipa spinosissima, commonly known as the Arequipa thornplant, is a shrub native to the high Andes of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the rocky terrain. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Arequipa spinosissima is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 4,000 meters, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
