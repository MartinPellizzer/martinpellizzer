<p>Aspidium impressum, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
