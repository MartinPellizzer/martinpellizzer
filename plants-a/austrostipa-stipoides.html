<p>Austrostipa stipoides, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Austrostipa stipoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range.</p>
