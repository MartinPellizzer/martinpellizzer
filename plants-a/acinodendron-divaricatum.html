                <h1>Acinodendron divaricatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron divaricatum, commonly known as the variable acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark and produces small, oval pods that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in degraded landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron divaricatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like manner. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron divaricatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron divaricatum was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soils, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been distributed across several tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.</p>
