<p>Aphelandra conformis, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated, yellow-orange bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are borne in clusters at the base of the bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aphelandra conformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and unique appearance.</p>
