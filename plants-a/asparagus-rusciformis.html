                    <h1>Asparagus rusciformis</h1>
<p>Asparagus rusciformis, commonly known as the silver asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, gray-green foliage with a silvery appearance due to the presence of fine, white hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are woody and can become branched over time, contributing to its shrub-like structure.</p>
<p>Asparagus rusciformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
