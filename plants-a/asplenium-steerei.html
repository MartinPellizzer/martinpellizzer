<p>Asplenium steerei, commonly known as the Steere's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium steerei is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
