                    <h1>Ascotheca</h1>
<p>Ascotheca, commonly known as a type of cup-like structure in certain fungi, is a specialized organ that houses ascospores.</p>
<p>It is typically found in the Ascomycota division, where it serves as the site of spore production. The ascotheca can vary in shape and size depending on the species, often being cup-shaped, flask-shaped, or spherical. It is composed of fungal hyphae that have thickened and hardened to form a protective casing.</p>
<p>This structure plays a crucial role in the reproductive cycle of the fungus by protecting the developing spores until they are released.</p>
