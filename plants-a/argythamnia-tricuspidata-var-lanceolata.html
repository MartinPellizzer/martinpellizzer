                    <h1>Argythamnia tricuspidata var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Argythamnia tricuspidata var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved argythamnia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, papery bracts that persist through the winter. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
