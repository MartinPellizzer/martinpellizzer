                <h1>Achillea clavennae var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. glabrata has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 3 to 8 cm in length, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are yellow in color, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. glabrata is a rare plant species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern France and Spain.</p>
<p>Currently, its distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, with some records in northern Africa. It thrives in dry, rocky environments such as slopes and cliffs, often in sunny, well-drained soils. This variety typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. glabrata is a low-maintenance perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, becoming active in spring and producing flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>It requires minimal watering, with deep watering during dry periods, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring. Pruning spent flower heads encourages new growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like rosemary or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. glabrata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its blooms for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. glabrata is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may involve its use in herbal teas or infusions. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, though research remains limited. Industrially, it may contribute to ecological landscaping and soil stabilization in arid regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often associated with resilience and endurance due to its hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. glabrata has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value and hardiness, including 'Snowdrift' and 'Alpine Carpet', which are known for their fluffy, white flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety is also involved in the creation of hybrids that combine traits from other achillea species, resulting in plants with improved cold tolerance and extended blooming periods. These hybrids are often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to their drought resistance and low maintenance requirements. The horticultural importance of Achillea clavennae var. glabrata lies in its ability to thrive in challenging conditions while adding visual interest to gardens with its delicate foliage and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it a valuable addition to both traditional and modern landscape designs.</p>
