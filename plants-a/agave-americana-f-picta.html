                    <h1>Agave americana f. picta</h1>
<p>Agave americana f. picta, commonly known as the variegated agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray with white or yellow variegation. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow-green flowers, though it is often grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
