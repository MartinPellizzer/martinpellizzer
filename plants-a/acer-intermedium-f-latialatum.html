                <h1>Acer intermedium f. latialatum</h1>
<p>Acer intermedium f. latialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a variant of the intermediate maple characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its foliage is typically bright green during the growing season, turning vibrant yellow in autumn, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. The tree has a moderate growth rate and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. latialatum has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside; the leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow furrows as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. latialatum is a rare variant of the intermediate maple, native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This species is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, Acer intermedium f. latialatum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. latialatum is a unique maple variant known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 5-10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigold can help deter pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. latialatum is a shade-tolerant tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in moist environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the overall health of forest habitats by offering ecological benefits like habitat creation and nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. latialatum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages. In industrial applications, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for crafting and furniture. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely niche, with further study needed to fully understand its potential roles.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. latialatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking yellow or variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used as a parent in hybridization to produce ornamental maples with enhanced leaf color and form. Hybrids involving this species often include combinations with other Acer species like *Acer palmatum* or *Acer japonicum*. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it holds significant horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a valuable addition to the collection of ornamental trees.</p>
