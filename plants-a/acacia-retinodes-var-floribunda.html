<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various native fauna.</p>
<p>The golden wattle is also a symbol of Australia and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia retinodes var. floribunda has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, feathery leaflets arranged in a dense, flat cluster, typically green in color and measuring about 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips.
