                <h1>Acinos majoranifolius</h1>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius, commonly known as the mountain thyme or rock thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme-like scent. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its fragrant properties, it is sometimes used in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius has leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, reddish-brown bark and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense heads, with yellow petals and a white center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Iberian Peninsula and the western Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. This plant prefers dry, sunny environments and is commonly found in open grasslands and scrublands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acinos majoranifolius is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius is a hardy, aromatic plant known for its medicinal and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, flowering in its second year before dying back, though it can reseed itself in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring supports growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
