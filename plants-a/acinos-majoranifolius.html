                <h1>Acinos majoranifolius</h1>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius, commonly known as the sweet everlasting or sweet everlasting thyme, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces small, seed-like fruits called caryopses, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments.</p>
<p>Its fragrant foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and herbal gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius has leaves that are narrow and lanceolate, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark and a creeping growth pattern that often forms mats. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions in southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. This plant thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and hot, dry summers. It is often associated with mountainous and coastal areas where it forms part of the local flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries like Spain, France, Italy, and parts of North Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climate characteristics, including regions with mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It has been reported in several regions of California and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
