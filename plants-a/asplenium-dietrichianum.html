<p>Asplenium dietrichianum, commonly known as the Dietrich's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors, often growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Asplenium dietrichianum is a cryptogamic plant that plays a minor but ecologically significant role in nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
