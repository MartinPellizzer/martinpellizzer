                <h1>Acourtia macvaughii</h1>
<p>Acourtia macvaughii, commonly known as the MacVaugh's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor nutrient conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers.</p>
<p>Acourtia macvaughii is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia macvaughii has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia macvaughii is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state of Sonora. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often in desert environments. Acourtia macvaughii is adapted to the harsh climate of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution makes it a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia macvaughii was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Southern California, particularly in areas with sandy soils and maritime climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and abandoned fields. This plant has been reported in several counties including San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as transportation and land development.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in these coastal environments.</p>
