<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe loheriana is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in desert or semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with areas that have low precipitation and high sun exposure.</p>
<p>Acampe loheriana is often seen in habitats like creosote bush scrub and chaparral.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe loheriana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest undergrowth.</p>
