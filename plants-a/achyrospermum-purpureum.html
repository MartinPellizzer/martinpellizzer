<p>Achyrospermum purpureum, commonly known as purple false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, purple to pink flowers. Its leaves are ovate and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum purpureum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that has a slightly rough texture.
