                <h1>Achillea corabensis</h1>
<p>Achillea corabensis, commonly known as the Balkan yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered with fine, silver-gray hairs. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads composed of numerous small white to pinkish florets. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a rough, serrated margin.</p>
<p>Achillea corabensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea corabensis has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a rough texture and serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and green in color, with a branching growth pattern that becomes more branched as the plant matures. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea corabensis is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula, specifically found in countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these regions, with populations occurring in specific mountainous areas. It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, typically found in grasslands and open slopes. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 800 to 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea corabensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea corabensis is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstock in early spring. The plant has a typical growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>
