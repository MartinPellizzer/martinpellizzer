                    <h1>Amblyachyrum</h1>
<p>Amblyachyrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features a unique, elongated stem with clusters of small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Amblyachyrum is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
