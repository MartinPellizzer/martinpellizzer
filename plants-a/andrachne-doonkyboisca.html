<p>Andrachne doonkyboisca, commonly known as the Moonshade Thorn, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue and violet, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight curl at the edges.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, the Moonshade Thorn is known for its sharp thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
