<p>Acer italum f. serbicum, commonly known as the Serbian maple, is a rare variant of the Italian maple.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
