                <h1>Adhatoda decussata</h1>
<p>Adhatoda decussata, commonly known as Indian bezoar or the blue mistflower, is a perennial shrub native to India and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often tinged with a bluish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adhatoda decussata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda decussata has alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a size ranging from 4 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white or pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda decussata is a medicinal plant native to tropical and southern Africa, particularly found in countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in parts of Asia, including India and China, for its therapeutic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda decussata is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its wild populations are under threat due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda decussata is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions, commonly known as the Indian bellflower.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal traits. The plant has a long growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during the growing season, but it should be reduced in winter to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
