                <h1>Adhatoda decussata</h1>
<p>Adhatoda decussata, commonly known as the Indian devil's ivy, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Adhatoda decussata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional systems of medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda decussata has alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with branching patterns. The flowers are tubular, with two lips, and are usually violet or purple in color, blooming from March to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, though they are not particularly thick or fleshy.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda decussata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with riverine and swampy areas. It is also present in some regions of Africa and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its preference for warm, humid habitats with adequate moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda decussata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it is considered an invasive species in some parts of its introduced range.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
