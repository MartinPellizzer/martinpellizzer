<p>Alamania punicea subsp.</p>
<p>greenwoodiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
