<p>Alsophila phalerata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The silver fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
