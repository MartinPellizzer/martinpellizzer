                    <h1>Adenium somalense var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Adenium somalense var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert apple, is a striking succulent shrub native to arid regions of Somalia and southern Arabia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant has palmate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are large, showy, and usually pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardioactive compounds and is used in traditional medicine and as a poison in some cultures.</p>
