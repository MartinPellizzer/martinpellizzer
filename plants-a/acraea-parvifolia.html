                <h1>Acraea parvifolia</h1>
<p>Acraea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved acraea, is a species of butterfly found in various parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its striking blue and black wing patterns. The plant serves as a host for the larvae of this butterfly, which feed on its leaves. Acraea parvifolia typically grows in open woodland and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Its leaves are small, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acraea parvifolia has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring blue or violet petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea parvifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, forested areas and is commonly found in secondary growth habitats. The plant is also present in parts of Madagascar and some islands in the Indian Ocean. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with shrublands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of its host plants, which are typically members of the Rubiaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea parvifolia was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate conditions, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it common in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite this, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and role in supporting local butterfly populations.</p>
