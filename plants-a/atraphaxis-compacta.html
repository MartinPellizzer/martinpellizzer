                    <h1>Atraphaxis compacta</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis compacta, commonly known as the dwarf desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis compacta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
