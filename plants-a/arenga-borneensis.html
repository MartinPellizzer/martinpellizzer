                    <h1>Arenga borneensis</h1>
<p>Arenga borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo areca, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a large, herbaceous plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into fibrous, elongated fruits. Arenga borneensis is notable for its fibrous trunk, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of natural fibers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts within its native habitat.</p>
