                    <h1>Angolluma nubica</h1>
<p>Angolluma nubica, commonly known as the cloudshade fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded, rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, bright green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight and retain moisture. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Angolluma nubica is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
