                <h1>Actephila aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Actephila aurantiaca, commonly known as the red-leaved actephila, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its vibrant orange to red leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Actephila aurantiaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila aurantiaca has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight ridged texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, orange-red capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila aurantiaca is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. This plant is commonly associated with humid environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. It is also present in parts of India and Malaysia, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila aurantiaca was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed in various regions where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread in non-native areas. It is often found in urban and suburban settings, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a concern in several regions where it has established itself.</p>
