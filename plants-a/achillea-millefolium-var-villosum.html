                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. villosum</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. villosum, commonly known as hairy yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy, fern-like leaves that are soft to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped umbels during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant.</p>
<p>Its fuzzy foliage and delicate blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and wildflower habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. villosum has lance-shaped, finely divided leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, typically ranging from light green to reddish-brown in color. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers, blooming from early summer to late autumn.</p>
<p>They are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system consists of a fibrous network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. villosum is a variant of the yarrow plant native to Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to North America, where it has been introduced and naturalized in various regions. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from lowlands up to around 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variant is generally stable, as it is not considered threatened and is commonly found in its native and introduced ranges.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. villosum is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. villosum is a hardy plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts various wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. The plant acts as an erosion control agent due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in disturbed areas. Additionally, it functions as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions.</p>
