                    <h1>Agrostis tenerrima</h1>
<p>Agrostis tenerrima, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Agrostis tenerrima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
