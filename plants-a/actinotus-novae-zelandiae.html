                <h1>Actinotus novae-zelandiae</h1>
<p>Actinotus novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand mountain beauty, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Stellariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Actinotus novae-zelandiae is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, making it a resilient and unique species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus novae-zelandiae has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age, growing upright with a branched structure. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, with five petals and a showy appearance, blooming in spring and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus novae-zelandiae is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, particularly in the South Island. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on cliffs or among boulders. The species is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of these areas.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic plant, showcasing the unique biodiversity of New Zealand's southern landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus novae-zelandiae was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the northern and central regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings. Although it is not considered invasive, it has become naturalized in some areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its introduction has also raised awareness about the ecological impacts of non-native plant species in New Zealand's unique ecosystems.</p>
