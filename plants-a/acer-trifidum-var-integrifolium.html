                <h1>Acer trifidum var. integrifolium</h1>
<p>Acer trifidum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically smooth-margined, hence the variety name *integrifolium*. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is gray and smooth when young, developing shallow fissures with age.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, fertile soils along streambanks and in woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer trifidum var. integrifolium has palmate leaves that are typically three to five lobed, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 10 cm in diameter, displaying a vibrant green color in spring that turns red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer trifidum var. integrifolium is a variant of the three-lobed maple native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in Georgia and Florida.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, mainly in the Coastal Plain region. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in open woods, hammocks, and along streambanks. This species typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level to about 60 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered endangered or of special concern in several states, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer trifidum var. integrifolium is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its delicate foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the plant and remove any diseased or damaged branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer trifidum var. integrifolium is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of insects and animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer trifidum var. integrifolium is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited culinary use due to its small,æ¶© (astringent) fruits, which are not typically consumed by humans.</p>
<p>While it may have some local medicinal applications in traditional herbal practices, these are not well-documented in modern scientific literature. Industrially, it contributes to ecological systems by providing habitat and food for wildlife, though it lacks significant economic value in commercial markets. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions where it is native, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological than utilitarian in most contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer trifidum var. integrifolium has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Atropurpureum' and 'Variegatum', which display striking purple and variegated foliage, respectively.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species to produce cultivars with enhanced hardiness and color variation. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates and soil conditions. Horticulturally, this variety is valued for its unique leaf shape and seasonal color changes, making it a sought-after addition to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticultural collections.</p>
