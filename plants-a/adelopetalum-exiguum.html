                <h1>Adelopetalum exiguum</h1>
<p>Adelopetalum exiguum, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, helping it to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>Adelopetalum exiguum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum exiguum has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are simple, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum exiguum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. This species is well adapted to the cold, dry conditions typical of these regions. It is commonly found in areas with poor soil and limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum exiguum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil conditions, making it common in semi-arid and temperate regions. This plant is often found in regions where human activity has altered the landscape, facilitating its spread. Its ability to grow from seeds and establish quickly contributes to its invasive potential in new environments.</p>
<p>It is considered a problematic species in some areas due to its rapid colonization of disturbed sites.</p>
