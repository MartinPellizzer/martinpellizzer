<p>Atriplex pseudocampanulata var. appendiculata, commonly known as the Desert Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its salt tolerance makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects in saline environments.</p>
