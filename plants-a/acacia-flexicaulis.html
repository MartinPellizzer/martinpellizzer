                    <h1>Acacia flexicaulis</h1>
<p>Acacia flexicaulis, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, phyllodes that are often curved or twisted. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are modified into phyllodes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
