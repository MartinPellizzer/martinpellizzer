                <h1>Acer obtusatum subsp. neapolitanum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum, commonly known as the Naples maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red and orange.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin and a rounded base, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel some distance from the parent plant.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum is a rare maple species native to southern Italy, particularly in the regions of Calabria and Sicily. While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, temperate environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum is a rare and ornamental maple species that thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with moderate growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a natural woodland look.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum is a small, shrub-like maple that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, red flowers.</p>
<p>Its dense growth acts as a companion plant, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky or marginal soils. The plant also offers ecological benefits by contributing to biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can serve as a nitrogen fixer, enhancing soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been historically explored for potential medicinal properties, though scientific validation remains limited.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a candidate for horticultural and landscape applications, contributing to the ornamental plant industry. Culturally, it holds significance in certain regions where it is admired for its unique foliage and resilience.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and aesthetic than industrial, though further research could uncover additional applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum has a range of varieties that are highly valued in horticulture for their ornamental qualities. Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum', known for their vibrant foliage colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>This species is also used in hybridization to create new forms with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and foliage coloration. Hybrids involving A. obtusatum subsp. neapolitanum are often sought after for their unique leaf patterns and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest and diversity to woodland and shade gardens.</p>
