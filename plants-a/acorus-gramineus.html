                <h1>Acorus gramineus</h1>
<p>Acorus gramineus, commonly known as narrow-leaf sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Acorus gramineus thrives in moist to aquatic environments, making it a common sight in marshes, ponds, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus gramineus has long, sword-shaped leaves that are usually narrow and slightly curved, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows from the base of the plant. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that turns red, dispersing its seeds through water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming dense underground networks that help the plant spread and anchor itself.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus gramineus is primarily native to Bangladesh, Cambodia, China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, Hainan, Inner Mongolia, Japan, Korea, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, Primorye, Qinghai, Taiwan, Thailand, Tibet, Vietnam, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams across its native range. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often growing in shallow water or damp soil. Acorus gramineus is known for its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these regions by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus gramineus was mainly introduced to Great Britain and Virginia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. This plant is known for its aromatic leaves and its ability to thrive in moist environments. It has been reported to spread along waterways and can form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
