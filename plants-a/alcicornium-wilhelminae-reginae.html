The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
