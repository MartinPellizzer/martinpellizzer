<p>Adiantum melanoleucum var. cubense, commonly known as the Cuban maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread slowly.</p>
<p>The leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving the plant a lacy appearance that is both ornamental and distinctive.</p>
