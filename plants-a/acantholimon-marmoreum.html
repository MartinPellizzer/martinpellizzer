                        <h1>Acantholimon marmoreum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon marmoreum, commonly known as the marble rockweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features slender, succulent stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Acantholimon marmoreum is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in dry climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon marmoreum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in environments with mild winters and warm, sunny summers. It is often associated with Mediterranean maquis and scrubland vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific climatic and geological conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon marmoreum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, succulent-like foliage and flowering capabilities. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists.</p>
