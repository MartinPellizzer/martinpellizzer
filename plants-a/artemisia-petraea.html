<p>Artemisia petraea, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to rocky and sandy habitats. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Artemisia petraea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal.</p>
