                <h1>Actaea cordifolia</h1>
<p>Actaea cordifolia, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces dark red berries that contain seeds, and it thrives in woodland habitats. Its rhizomes and roots are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its distinctive morphology and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea cordifolia has leaves that are heart-shaped (cordate), arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more deeply furrowed with age. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in an upright, branched cluster (panicle), blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, berry-like structure that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and through the excretion of animals.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and survive in shaded woodland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea cordifolia is primarily native to Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks within these regions. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained to slightly moist soils. It is often associated with mixed hardwood forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the southeastern and midwestern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea cordifolia was mainly introduced to Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas throughout the state. This plant is often seen in shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has become a notable part of the local flora in the region.</p>
<p>Its presence has been documented in various natural areas across Pennsylvania.</p>
