                <h1>Adenocalymma aspericarpum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma aspericarpum, commonly known as the rough-sepaled grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, rough-textured pods. It is typically found in grassland habitats and is adapted to dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma aspericarpum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma aspericarpum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to grey in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma aspericarpum is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils. This species thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma aspericarpum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils, typically in coastal or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained environments and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant is commonly associated with coastal dunes and sandplains, where it can tolerate salt spray and harsh weather conditions. Its introduction has been documented in several regions, including parts of Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
