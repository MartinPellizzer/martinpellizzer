<p>Adhatoda nuda, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or White Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and distinctive trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda nuda has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they vary in size from 3 to 7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>
