                <h1>Acrostichum cervinum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cervinum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands of southeastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green stems. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum cervinum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cervinum has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dark brown, three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cervinum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas such as swamps, marshes, and riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with abundant rainfall and partial to full shade. Its native range extends from Mexico through countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is often associated with wetland ecosystems and plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cervinum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is often spread through water and wind due to its floating seeds. It has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding as a result of human activity and climate change.</p>
