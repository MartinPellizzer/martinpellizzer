                        <h1>Acacia arabica var. cupressiformis</h1>
<p>Acacia arabica var. cupressiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in clusters, giving it a resemblance to cypress trees. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used traditionally for construction and fuel.</p>
