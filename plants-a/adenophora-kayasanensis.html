                <h1>Adenophora kayasanensis</h1>
<p>Adenophora kayasanensis, commonly known as the Japanese bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora kayasanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora kayasanensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing in a clustered or solitary pattern. The flowers are bell-shaped, with a white to pale blue color, blooming in summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora kayasanensis is primarily native to the Korean Peninsula, specifically South Korea.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with the Korean endemic flora and is often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora kayasanensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in regions with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections due to its ornamental value and adaptability. This plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively easy to grow, making it a popular choice for horticultural purposes. It has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems if it becomes invasive.</p>
