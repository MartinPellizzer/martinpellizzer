                <h1>Adelanthus scandens</h1>
<p>Adelanthus scandens, commonly known as the climbing stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-draining soil. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Adelanthus scandens is an evergreen perennial that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelanthus scandens has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, with a smooth texture, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender, climbing in growth pattern, with a slightly hairy texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, with a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelanthus scandens is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western and northern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelanthus scandens was mainly introduced to areas with specific environmental conditions that support its growth, such as well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant has been introduced to various parts of the world, including California and parts of Australia, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent its spread into native plant communities.</p>
