<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne obovata has elliptical to obovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the summer months and likely pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>
