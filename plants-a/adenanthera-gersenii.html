                <h1>Adenanthera gersenii</h1>
<p>Adenanthera gersenii, commonly known as the Gersen's ticktree, is a small shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal.</p>
<p>Adenanthera gersenii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera gersenii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are elliptical in shape, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length, and are typically a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with lateral branches, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera gersenii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in areas with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>Adenanthera gersenii is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera gersenii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and along riverbanks, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This species is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent its spread into native habitats.</p>
