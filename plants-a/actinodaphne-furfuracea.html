                <h1>Actinodaphne furfuracea</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy bark and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its small, fragrant flowers are followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne furfuracea has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in panicles, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne furfuracea is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly observed in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing along the forest floor or on the bases of trees. The species is well adapted to the moist and nutrient-rich soils of Borneo's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the island, with no known presence in other regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne furfuracea was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. The plant is often used in landscaping and as a hedge because of its dense growth habit. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological impacts in some areas where it establishes itself outside of controlled settings.</p>
