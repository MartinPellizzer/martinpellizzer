<p>Alsophila haenkei, commonly known as the Hainan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to southern China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal.</p>
<p>Alsophila haenkei is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity.</p>
