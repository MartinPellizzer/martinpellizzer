                <h1>Aconitum pyramidatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum pyramidatum, commonly known as the Pyramidal Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, spires of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. Its roots are toxic and contain potent alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pyramidatum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, upright, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are large, showy, and borne in clusters at the top of the stem, featuring spurred petals in shades of blue to purple, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The plant produces follicle fruits that release seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are long, fibrous, and tuberous, adapted for anchoring and nutrient absorption in moist, temperate soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pyramidatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas where the climate is cool and moist. This species thrives in temperate to subalpine environments, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its native range extends across countries such as China, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, making it a resilient and distinctive member of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pyramidatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers. The plant has since spread into natural areas, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a noxious weed in several states.</p>
