                <h1>Aegilops crassa</h1>
<p>Aegilops crassa, commonly known as rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, dark green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with bract-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. Aegilops crassa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops crassa has leaves that are broad and ovate in shape, with a dark green color and a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright and cylindrical with a light green bark that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind once matured.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>
