<p>Aegilops crassa, commonly known as rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, dark green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with bract-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. Aegilops crassa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
