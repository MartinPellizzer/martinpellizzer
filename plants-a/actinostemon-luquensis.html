                <h1>Actinostemon luquensis</h1>
<p>Actinostemon luquensis, commonly known as the Luqu√©n starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Actinostemon luquensis is adapted to grow in rocky, arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon luquensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon luquensis is primarily native to the subtropical regions of South America, specifically in the coastal areas of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the province of Buenos Aires, particularly around the city of La Plata. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils near the coast and is often associated with sandy or alluvial plains. It is an important species in local ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and serving as a habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon luquensis was mainly introduced to specific regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along riverbanks, roadsides, and in human-modified landscapes due to its adaptability to various soil types and environmental conditions. The plant's introduction is likely linked to human activities such as agriculture and land development, which have facilitated its spread. While it is not considered invasive in its introduced range, it has the potential to compete with native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution highlights the impact of human-mediated dispersal on plant colonization patterns.</p>
