                        <h1>Abies coahuilensis</h1>
<p>Abies coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along its branches. The tree produces cones that are typically cylindrical and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in association with other endemic species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
