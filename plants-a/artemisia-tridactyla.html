                    <h1>Artemisia tridactyla</h1>
<p>Artemisia tridactyla, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia tridactyla is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
