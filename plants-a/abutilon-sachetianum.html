                <h1>Abutilon sachetianum</h1>
<p>Abutilon sachetianum, commonly known as the Indian velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woolly, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon sachetianum has palmate leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a waxy green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, semi-woody, with a smooth, pale green to brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are pendulous, yellowish-green with orange stamens, clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a hairy, triangular capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to drought conditions by storing water in the stem.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon sachetianum is a flowering plant native to the western regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Central and South America, as well as some regions in the Caribbean. This species thrives in humid, warm environments, often found in coastal lowlands and mountainous regions. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Abutilon sachetianum is considered a species of concern and may be at risk of becoming endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon sachetianum is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and blooming in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage blooming are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
