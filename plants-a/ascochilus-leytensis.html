                    <h1>Ascochilus leytensis</h1>
<p>Ascochilus leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence bears a cluster of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ascochilus leytensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
