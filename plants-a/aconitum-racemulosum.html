                <h1>Aconitum racemulosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum racemulosum, commonly known as the clustered aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, erect stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers arranged in a dense raceme. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, and its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes. Aconitum racemulosum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum racemulosum has leaves that are compound, consisting of several ovate to lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, with a deep green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often reaching several meters in height, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly cracked with age. The flowers are borne in dense, racemose inflorescences, featuring showy blue to purple petals with yellow veins, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, cool environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum racemulosum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions of central China, including provinces such as Hubei, Sichuan, and Hunan. It typically grows in mountainous areas with moist, temperate climates. Aconitum racemulosum is commonly found in forests and meadows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum racemulosum was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is commonly found in wetlands, riparian zones, and other moist habitats.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly, leading to competition with native flora.</p>
