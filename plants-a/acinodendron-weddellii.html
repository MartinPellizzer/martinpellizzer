                <h1>Acinodendron weddellii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron weddellii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are elliptical in shape, slightly serrated along the edges, and have a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale gray bark that exfoliates in thin, papery strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron weddellii is primarily native to the eastern coast of Africa, specifically from Kenya to Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal forests and lowland rainforests along the eastern seaboard. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth vegetation and can be found in protected areas such as national parks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron weddellii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of botanical collections. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites. It is commonly found in coastal and disturbed areas throughout the country.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has not significantly impacted native ecosystems.</p>
