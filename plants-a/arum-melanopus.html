                    <h1>Arum melanopus</h1>
<p>Arum melanopus, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive purple-tinged, arrow-shaped leaf that is often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces a spadix, which is surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, purple, or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>While it is ornamental, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
