<p>Arenaria cambodianum, commonly known as the Cambodian sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Cambodia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
