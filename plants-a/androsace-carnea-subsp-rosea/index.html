<p>Androsace rosea, scientifically known as Androsace carnea subsp. rosea, is a charming alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its beauty makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected plant in many areas.</p>
