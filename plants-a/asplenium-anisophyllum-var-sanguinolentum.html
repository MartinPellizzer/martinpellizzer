                    <h1>Asplenium anisophyllum var. sanguinolentum</h1>
<p>Asplenium anisophyllum var. sanguinolentum, commonly known as the blood fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a dark reddish-brown hue along the midrib. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The unique coloration of its fronds makes it a striking addition to botanical collections and gardens.</p>
