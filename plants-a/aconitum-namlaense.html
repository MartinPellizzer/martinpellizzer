                <h1>Aconitum namlaense</h1>
<p>Aconitum namlaense, commonly known as the Namla monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aconitum namlaense thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Like other members of its genus, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum namlaense has leaves that are compound, typically consisting of several ovate to lanceolate leaflets arranged in an alternate pattern along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and typically has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, consisting of spurred petals in shades of blue or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum namlaense is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude regions of this region, typically in mountainous areas with cool climates. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with alpine environments. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum namlaense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Oregon and Washington. The plant is believed to have been introduced through accidental seed dispersal from nearby gardens or horticultural sources. It has since established itself in moist, shady forest habitats.</p>
<p>However, its spread remains limited, and it is not yet considered invasive in the area.</p>
