                    <h1>Arachnitis uniflora</h1>
<p>Arachnitis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, solitary white flower that sits atop a slender, leafless stem. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged in water, adapting it to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Arachnitis uniflora is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often flowering only during specific wet seasons.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
