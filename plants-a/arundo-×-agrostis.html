                    <h1>Arundo × agrostis</h1>
<p>Arundo × agrostis, commonly known as the hybrid reedgrass, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arundo donax and Agrostis species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like structure and is often found in wetland environments. The plant typically has narrow, linear leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, which limits its natural spread.</p>
<p>It is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or used in phytoremediation projects.</p>
