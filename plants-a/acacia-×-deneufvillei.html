                        <h1>Acacia × deneufvillei</h1>
<p>Acacia × deneufvillei, commonly known as the hybrid acacia, is a cross between two acacia species, typically Acacia aneura and Acacia longifolia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to Australia, characterized by its slender, often multi-branched form. The plant features phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Acacia × deneufvillei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia × deneufvillei is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>This hybrid species is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often seen growing along rocky outcrops and in open grasslands, adapting well to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific climatic and geographical conditions of southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia × deneufvillei was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This hybrid species is a result of crossbreeding between Acacia karroo and Acacia longifolia, making it a unique example of artificial selection in plant breeding. Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other regions with similar climates, such as parts of Australia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited to managed environments rather than natural ecosystems.</p>
