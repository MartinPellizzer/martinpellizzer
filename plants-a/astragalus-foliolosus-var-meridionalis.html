                    <h1>Astragalus foliolosus var. meridionalis</h1>
<p>Astragalus foliolosus var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern leafy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
