                <h1>Achyropsis gracilis</h1>
<p>Achyropsis gracilis, commonly known as the slender glasswort, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in saline and alkaline soils. The plant features thin, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Achyropsis gracilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropsis gracilis has slender, cylindrical stems that are smooth and green, growing upright with a branching pattern.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem, measuring about 1-2 cm in length and a light green color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with five petals, blooming in the spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it to anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis gracilis is primarily native to the coastal regions of South Africa, particularly the Western Cape province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy and gravelly soils along the coastlines and in dune environments. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, often growing in open, sunny areas. It is well adapted to withstand high salt levels and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis gracilis was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or machinery.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, fields, and urban areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively contribute to its invasive potential. Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study in many areas.</p>
