<p>Arabidopsis petraea subsp.</p>
<p>septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and genetic simplicity, it is sometimes used in ecological studies and as a model organism in plant biology.</p>
