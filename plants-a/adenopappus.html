<p>Adenopappus, commonly known as the "hairy pappus" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique pappus structures, which are modified bracts that aid in seed dispersal.

<p>The genus is known for its ecological adaptability and role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
