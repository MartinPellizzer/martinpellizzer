                    <h1>Aethusa toxicaria</h1>
<p>Aethusa toxicaria, commonly known as the hemlock or poison hemlock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, umbrella-shaped flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds, including cicutoxin and other alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to edible plants, it is often mistaken for parsley or hemlock, leading to accidental poisoning.</p>
