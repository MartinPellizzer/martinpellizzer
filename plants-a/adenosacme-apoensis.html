                <h1>Adenosacme apoensis</h1>
<p>Adenosacme apoensis, commonly known as the Philippine mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many species of morning glories. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adenosacme apoensis is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme apoensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a mild fragrance. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and bloom from April to June, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme apoensis is a rare plant species native to the Philippines, specifically found on the island of Luzon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few locations in the mountainous regions of northern Luzon. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within primary lowland and montane rainforests. Adenosacme apoensis is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenosacme apoensis is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushiness are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
