                <h1>Adenostyles macrophylla</h1>
<p>Adenostyles macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf mountain-mahonia, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in terminal panicles. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>Adenostyles macrophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles macrophylla has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles macrophylla is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This species thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is especially prevalent in the southern and central regions of California.</p>
<p>Adenostyles macrophylla is an important plant in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles macrophylla was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean Basin, particularly in regions with a climate similar to its native habitat in southern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, especially its showy inflorescences. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
