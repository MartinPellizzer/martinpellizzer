                <h1>Acicarpha spathulata</h1>
<p>Acicarpha spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acicarpha spathulata has leaves that are ovate to spatulate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acicarpha spathulata is primarily native to Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in open grasslands and disturbed soils. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to the warm and humid climate typical of these parts of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acicarpha spathulata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in regions with a warm climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields where it can establish quickly. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and competitive ability. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Proper management strategies are necessary to control its spread and mitigate its ecological effects.</p>
