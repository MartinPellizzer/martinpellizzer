<p>Acer nambuanum, commonly known as the Nambu maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
