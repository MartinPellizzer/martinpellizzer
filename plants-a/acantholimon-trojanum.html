                        <h1>Acantholimon trojanum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon trojanum, commonly known as the Trojan thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments. It has a low-growing habit with a sprawling stem and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
