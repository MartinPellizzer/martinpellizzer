<p>Argillochloa dasyclada, commonly known as the slender sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of dust, aiding in water retention. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Argillochloa dasyclada plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in dune and coastal habitats.</p>
