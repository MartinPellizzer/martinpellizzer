                    <h1>Amygdalus eocenica</h1>
<p>Amygdalus eocenica, commonly known as the Eocene almond, is an extinct species of the Prunoideae subfamily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits and woody structure, similar to modern almond trees. Fossil records suggest it thrived in temperate climates during the Eocene epoch, approximately 56 to 33.9 million years ago. The plant likely had compound leaves and produced flowers with sepals and petals.</p>
<p>Its botanical features provide insights into the evolution of the Prunus genus and the ecological conditions of the ancient world.</p>
