<p>Aronicum viscosum, commonly known as sticky arnica, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often branching near the top. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, disc-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in a sticky resinous substance.</p>
<p>The sticky resin has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
