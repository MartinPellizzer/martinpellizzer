<p>Aristida acutiflora subsp.</p>
<p>zittelii, commonly known as Zittel's three-awn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear short, bristly lemma hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its fine texture and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Zittel's three-awn plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
