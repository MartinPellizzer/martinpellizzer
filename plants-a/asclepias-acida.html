                    <h1>Asclepias acida</h1>
<p>Asclepias acida, commonly known as sour milkweed, is a species of milkweed native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called corona. Its milky sap contains latex, which is a common feature among milkweed species.</p>
<p>Asclepias acida plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
