                    <h1>Althaea kurdica</h1>
<p>Althaea kurdica, commonly known as Kurdish marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a soft, woolly texture. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in terminal racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Althaea kurdica is valued for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties.</p>
