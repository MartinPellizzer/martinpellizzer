                <h1>Aconitum variegatum subsp. kotulae</h1>
<p>Aconitum variegatum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae, commonly known as the Kotula's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant has compound, deeply lobed leaves that are typically dark green with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum variegatum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae has compound, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures.</p>
<p>Its flowers are blue to purple, consisting of five petals and a distinctive spurred petal, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for nutrient uptake in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum variegatum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae is a rare plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within Romania and Ukraine, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It typically grows in forested slopes and meadows, often near streams or in shaded woodland undergrowth. This subspecies is found at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Aconitum variegatum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulaa is a striking perennial plant known for its colorful, showy flowers. It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of mature rhizomes, with seed propagation requiring a cold stratification period.</p>
<p>This species has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers and seeds in its second year before dying back. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum variegatum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae is a valuable plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its vibrant flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of species. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its robust root system, which stabilizes soil in moist or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by offering shelter and food resources to various organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum variegatum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulae is a lesser-known plant with limited direct uses in culinary or medicinal applications due to its toxicity. It is primarily of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its presence in specific alpine habitats makes it valuable for ecological studies and understanding plant adaptation. Culturally, it may hold significance in local traditions or as a symbol of resilience in harsh environments.</p>
<p>However, its role in industrial or economic contexts remains minimal, and it is not widely utilized beyond scientific purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Aconitum variegatum subsp.</p>
<p>kotulaa has several popular cultivars, such as 'Belle Ã‰poque' and 'Crimson King', which are prized for their vibrant blue and purple flowers. It is also commonly hybridized with other aconitum species to produce varieties with enhanced hardiness and more striking floral displays.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved growth habits and broader color ranges, making them more adaptable to different garden conditions. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes to the diversity of garden plants in the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
