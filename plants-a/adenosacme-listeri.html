                <h1>Adenosacme listeri</h1>
<p>Adenosacme listeri, commonly known as the slender adenosacme, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adenosacme listeri is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme listeri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, with a simple structure consisting of five petals and stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme listeri is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a characteristic species of the Mediterranean biome. It is often seen growing on cliffs, slopes, and along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme listeri was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native habitat, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils has contributed to its spread in these areas. It is often found in coastal and urban areas where human activity is prevalent.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited research on its invasive potential.</p>
