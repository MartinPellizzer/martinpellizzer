                <h1>Achras vitellina</h1>
<p>Achras vitellina, commonly known as the yellow star tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a heavy, waxy fruit that contains a single, large seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras vitellina has large, palm-like leaves that are typically clustered at the top of the plant, with a broad, fan-shaped appearance, a dark green color, and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and short, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it access water from deeper layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras vitellina is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It thrives in the humid and warm climates of the Amazon Basin and adjacent areas. This plant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras vitellina was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential as a fruit-bearing plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries like Brazil, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is often cultivated in home gardens and commercial farms due to its attractive yellow-orange fruit and tolerance to various soil conditions. It has also been introduced to some areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific climate requirements and the need for careful cultivation.</p>
