                <h1>Achras vitellina</h1>
<p>Achras vitellina, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, buttressed trunk and broad, palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by its most notable feature—large, round, green fruits that mature to a yellowish color. The fruit contains a starchy, edible pulp and a central core of seeds, making it an important food source in many tropical countries.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes other economically important plants like figs and mulberries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras vitellina has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30–60 cm in diameter, with a broad, lobed shape and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, arranged in a panicle inflorescence, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiky, yellowish-orange drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras vitellina is a tropical plant native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Yemen.</p>
<p>While it is originally from Socotra, it has been introduced to other regions such as the Canary Islands and parts of southern Africa. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing in coastal areas and rocky soils. It is usually found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its population.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras vitellina is a fast-growing, palm-like plant native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seed propagation often yielding more vigorous plants. The growth cycle of Achras vitellina is rapid, with mature plants reaching heights of up to 15 feet in a few years, making it suitable for tropical gardens or indoor spaces.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead fronds helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or banana trees can enhance its growth and provide a lush, vibrant garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras vitellina is a tropical plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land stabilization.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of the ecosystem by supporting a diverse array of life forms.</p>
