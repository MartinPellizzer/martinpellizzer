                <h1>Actinophloeus capitis-yorki</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus capitis-yorki, commonly known as the York Island pandanus, is a unique flowering plant native to the Torres Strait and surrounding islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Pandanus genus, characterized by its pinnate leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant exhibits a distinctive growth habit with a short, woody stem and long, fibrous leaves that droop downward. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a fragrant scent to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its coastal habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus capitis-yorki has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in spikes, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus capitis-yorki is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It is commonly associated with sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus capitis-yorki was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1980s and has since spread across various regions of the country. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed or urban environments. Its rapid spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it has become an integral part of the local ecosystem in some areas.</p>
