<p>Anthriscus glacialis, commonly known as the alpine cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions at high altitudes.</p>
