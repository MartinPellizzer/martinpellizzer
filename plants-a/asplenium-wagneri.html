<p>Asplenium wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium wagneri is a relatively uncommon species, making it a prized addition to specialized botanical collections.</p>
