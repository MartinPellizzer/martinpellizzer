                    <h1>Aconitum nielamuense</h1>
<p>Aconitum nielamuense, commonly known as Nielamu Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces globose, ribbed follicles that contain the toxic alkaloids responsible for its potent medicinal and poisonous properties. Aconitum nielamuense thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it requires careful handling and is primarily used in traditional medicine under strict supervision.</p>
