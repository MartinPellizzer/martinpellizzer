                <h1>Aconitum nielamuense</h1>
<p>Aconitum nielamuense, commonly known as Nielamu Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces globose, ribbed follicles that contain the toxic alkaloids responsible for its potent medicinal and poisonous properties. Aconitum nielamuense thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it requires careful handling and is primarily used in traditional medicine under strict supervision.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum nielamuense has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to violet, arranged in racemes, featuring showy, spurred petals and a short blooming period in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, aiding in the plant's survival in rocky or poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nielamuense is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool and moist conditions. The species is typically found in meadows and rocky areas within the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in Tibet.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nielamuense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in mountainous or hilly regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. The plant is known for its striking blue to purple flowers and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
