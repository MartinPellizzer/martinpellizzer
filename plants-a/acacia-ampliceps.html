                        <h1>Acacia ampliceps</h1>
<p>Acacia ampliceps, commonly known as the broad-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia ampliceps is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep root systems and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria.</p>
