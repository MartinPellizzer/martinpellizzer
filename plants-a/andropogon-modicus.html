<p>Andropogon modicus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in prairie and woodland habitats, reaching heights of up to six feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Andropogon modicus is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability.</p>
