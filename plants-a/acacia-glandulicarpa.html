                        <h1>Acacia glandulicarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia glandulicarpa, commonly known as the glandular acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are often followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia glandulicarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats.</p>
