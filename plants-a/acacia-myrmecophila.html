                    <h1>Acacia myrmecophila</h1>
<p>Acacia myrmecophila, commonly known as the African silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and it produces pods containing seeds. It is also known for its mutualistic relationship with ants, which inhabit the hollow thorns on its stems.</p>
<p>This relationship provides the plant with protection from herbivores.</p>
