<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial arnica, is a variant of the water plantain that exhibits a more terrestrial growth habit compared to its aquatic relatives.</p>
<p>This plant typically features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often emerging above the leafy foliage. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine.</p>
