                    <h1>Aira tenera var. biaristata</h1>
<p>Aira tenera var. biaristata, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a striking visual appearance, especially in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are clustered along its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, mat-like growth that suppresses weeds and retains soil moisture.</p>
