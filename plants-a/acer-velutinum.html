                    <h1>Acer velutinum</h1>
<p>Acer velutinum, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
