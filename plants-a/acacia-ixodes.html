                    <h1>Acacia ixodes</h1>
<p>Acacia ixodes, commonly known as the broad-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorned branches and compound leaves that are often bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like seed pods containing small, hard seeds. Acacia ixodes is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
