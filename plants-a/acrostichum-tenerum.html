                <h1>Acrostichum tenerum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tenerum, commonly known as the soft fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
<p>Acrostichum tenerum is a member of the family Blechnaceae, which includes other primitive ferns with similar structural features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tenerum has narrow, elongated leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a dense, grass-like rosette, with a bright green color and a smooth, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a fibrous, light brown bark that grows close to the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tenerum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. This plant is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found along tidal mudflats and brackish water environments. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tenerum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it can thrive in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system. It has become naturalized in several areas beyond its original range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation.</p>
