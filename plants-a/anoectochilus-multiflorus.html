<p>It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Anoectochilus multiflorus is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine.</p>
