                    <h1>Anacampseros kurtzii</h1>
<p>Anacampseros kurtzii, commonly known as the desert cactus or the stone cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Anacampseros kurtzii is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat.</p>
