<p>Acalypha cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acalypha cylindrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cylindrica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist lowland areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and is often associated with forest edges and secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of India and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Acalypha cylindrica is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cylindrica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread to other tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned lands. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to its classification as an invasive species in several areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora for resources.</p>
