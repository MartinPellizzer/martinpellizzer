                <h1>Acinodendron alternans</h1>
<p>Acinodendron alternans, commonly known as the zigzag acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging branches and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Acinodendron alternans is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry savannas and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron alternans has alternate, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron alternans is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly the tropical regions of Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests where it grows as an understory plant. This species is commonly found in the archipelagos of Sumatra and Borneo, where the climate supports its growth. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, making it a regionally significant species in the region's flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron alternans was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial to full sun exposure. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
