                    <h1>Ajuga crenata</h1>
<p>Ajuga crenata, commonly known as carpet bugle or creeping ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Ajuga crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shady, moist environments.</p>
