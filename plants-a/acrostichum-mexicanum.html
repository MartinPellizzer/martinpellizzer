                <h1>Acrostichum mexicanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and marshes. The plant has feathery, delicate fronds that are typically green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mexicanum has large, broad, leathery leaves that are typically lance-shaped or elliptical, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and range in size from 30 to 60 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, light green to brown bark that has a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mexicanum is primarily native to Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and parts of Colombia and Ecuador. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing near water sources like rivers and swamps. It is commonly associated with wetland habitats and is sometimes found in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mexicanum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries in the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of South America. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as abandoned agricultural fields and along riverbanks. Its introduction may be due to accidental transport through human activity or intentional planting for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented in many regions.</p>
