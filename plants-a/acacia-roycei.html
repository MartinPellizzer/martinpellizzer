<p>Acacia roycei, commonly known as the Royal Acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and pairs of small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments.</p>
<p>Acacia roycei is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots and a slow growth rate.</p>
