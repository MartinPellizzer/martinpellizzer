                    <h1>Atriplex rosea</h1>
<p>Atriplex rosea, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in saline areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex rosea is also used in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock.</p>
