                <h1>Achyrophorus andinus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus andinus, commonly known as the Andean fireweed, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Achyrophorus andinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus andinus has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus andinus is primarily native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and northern Argentina. This plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in the cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. It thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the Andes mountain range, where it is adapted to the unique microclimates of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus andinus was mainly introduced to areas with high altitudes and cool climates, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. The plant has been reported in parts of South America, particularly in the Andes. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as horticultural practices or accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unknown due to limited study.</p>
