                    <h1>Achasma</h1>
<p>Achasma, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, white, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant is notable for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often appearing only for a short period during the summer months. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique ecological niche, Achasma is considered a subject of scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
