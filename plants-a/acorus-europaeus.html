                    <h1>Acorus europaeus</h1>
<p>Acorus europaeus, commonly known as European sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow directly from the rhizomes, which are thick, fleshy underground stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spathes that enclose the spores, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Acorus europaeus thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties.</p>
