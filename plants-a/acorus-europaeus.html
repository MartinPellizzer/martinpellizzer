                <h1>Acorus europaeus</h1>
<p>Acorus europaeus, commonly known as European sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow directly from the rhizomes, which are thick, fleshy underground stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spathes that enclose the spores, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Acorus europaeus thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus europaeus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, pale green surface, and grows from a rhizomatous root system. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a spadix surrounded by a spathe, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomes that spread horizontally underground, helping the plant to colonize wet areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus europaeus is primarily native to temperate regions of Europe, particularly the British Isles, western Europe, and parts of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the margins of lakes and rivers where the soil remains consistently moist. This plant thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is also occasionally found in the Mediterranean region, though it is less common there compared to its northern European range.</p>
<p>Acorus europaeus is a perennial herb that plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus europaeus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and landscaping efforts.</p>
<p>It has been reported in various regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. The plant's ability to thrive in wetland conditions has contributed to its spread in these areas. It is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
