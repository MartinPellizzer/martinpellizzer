<p>Andropogon marginatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Andropogon marginatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
