                        <h1>Acacia planifrons</h1>
<p>Acacia planifrons, commonly known as the flat-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are flat and narrow, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Acacia planifrons is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia planifrons is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open grasslands.</p>
<p>Acacia planifrons plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia planifrons was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded lands.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and deep root system. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems. It has been introduced in several regions across Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to the displacement of native vegetation if not managed properly.</p>
