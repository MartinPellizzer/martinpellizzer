                <h1>Acronia tonduzii</h1>
<p>Acronia tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz's acronia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronia tonduzii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia tonduzii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a faint resinous scent, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern by twining around supporting structures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia tonduzii is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, specifically southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. This plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in mountainous or coastal regions. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often associated with scrublands and maquis vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia tonduzii was mainly introduced to regions with warm, arid climates where it can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It has been reported in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, where it has established itself in both natural and disturbed habitats. The plant is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides, where it can spread rapidly due to its adaptability. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it remains a relatively localized species with limited ecological impact compared to other introduced plants.</p>
