<p>Antennaria monocephala subsp.</p>
<p>angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
