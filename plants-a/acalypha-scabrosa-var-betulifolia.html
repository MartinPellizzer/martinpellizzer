                        <h1>Acalypha scabrosa var. betulifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, birch-like leaves that are elliptical and have a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are surrounded by bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and ecological role make it a notable species in native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. betulifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to warm, humid environments with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. betulifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking to diversify the local landscape with exotic species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island ecosystems.</p>
