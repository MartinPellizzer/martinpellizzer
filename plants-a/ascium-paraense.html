                    <h1>Ascium paraense</h1>
<p>Ascium paraense, commonly known as the Paraense cup fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its unique cup-shaped or disc-like fruiting body.</p>
<p>It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often on decaying wood or leaf litter. The fungus produces spores within sac-like structures called ascospores, which are released through the apical opening of the ascus. Its mycelium is usually dark-colored and can form dense networks beneath the substrate.</p>
<p>Ascium paraense plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter in its ecosystem.</p>
