<p>Arundinaria vulgata, commonly known as the bamboo grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps and spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Arundinaria vulgata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands.</p>
