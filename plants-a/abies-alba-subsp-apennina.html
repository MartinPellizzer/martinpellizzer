<p>Abies alba subsp.</p>
<p>apennina, commonly known as the Apennine fir, is a subspecies of the silver fir native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical silver fir.</p>
<p>The cones are slender and usually hang downward, with distinctive bract-like structures. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often forming dense forests in the Apennine Mountains.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various mountain species and contributing to soil stabilization in alpine regions.</p>
