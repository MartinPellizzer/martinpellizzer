                <h1>Acourtia runcinata</h1>
<p>Acourtia runcinata, commonly known as the coast needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white to pale blue flowers. It is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acourtia runcinata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia runcinata has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, slender leaflets that are usually gray-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia runcinata is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, and Texas.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in coastal and sandy habitats along the Gulf Coast. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in dune environments. Acourtia runcinata is adapted to the warm, humid climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the southeastern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia runcinata was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, dandelion-like appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
