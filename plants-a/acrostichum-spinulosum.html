                    <h1>Acrostichum spinulosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive spinulose texture along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
