<p>Aspidium divergens, commonly known as the broad holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are divided into numerous pinnae. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a dark green color that becomes more pronounced with age.
