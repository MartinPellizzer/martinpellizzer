                <h1>Acinodendron lappaceum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron lappaceum, commonly known as the Lappaceum acinodendron, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a rough texture and prominent veins.</p>
<p>Acinodendron lappaceum is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lappaceum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a creeping or prostrate manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lappaceum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is typically associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lappaceum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of plants for ornamental or horticultural purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is now considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where it can thrive.</p>
