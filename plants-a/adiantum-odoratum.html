                    <h1>Adiantum odoratum</h1>
<p>Adiantum odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often described as lace-like in appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Adiantum odoratum thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Its elegant foliage makes it a popular choice for both garden cultivation and indoor plant displays.</p>
