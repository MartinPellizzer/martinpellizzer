                <h1>Acer davidii f. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Acer davidii f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous David maple, is a variant of the David maple species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and vibrant autumn foliage that displays shades of red and orange. This deciduous tree typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and has opposite, palmately compound leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climate conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer davidii f. glabrescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer davidii f. glabrescens is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated locations in these areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and shaded rock crevices at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer davidii f. glabrescens is a rare, slow-growing ornamental maple known for its striking red foliage and unique, twisted trunk.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings taken in late summer or through seeds collected from mature trees, though seed germination is often slow and unreliable. This plant prefers well-drained, acidic soil and requires consistent moisture during its active growth cycle, which spans spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches will promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with horticultural oils.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal while improving soil health and biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer davidii f. glabrescens is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>
