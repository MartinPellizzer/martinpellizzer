                <h1>Abroma angulosum</h1>
<p>Abroma angulosum, commonly known as the angular abroma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its angular, often thorny stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a rough or hairy texture.</p>
<p>Abroma angulosum is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in arid landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abroma angulosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and greenish-brown in color, with a woody texture and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring five white petals and five yellow sepals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma angulosum is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in open forests, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Abroma angulosum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though local threats such as habitat loss and overharvesting may affect its populations in certain areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abroma angulosum is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and promote flowering are essential. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abroma angulosum is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving habitat quality.</p>
