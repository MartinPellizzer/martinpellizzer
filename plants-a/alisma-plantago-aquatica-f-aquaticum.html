                    <h1>Alisma plantago-aquatica f. aquaticum</h1>
<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica f. aquaticum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering pollutants.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic environments.</p>
