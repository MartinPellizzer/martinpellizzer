<p>Acalypha eremorum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a succulent stem that stores water.</p>
<p>Acalypha eremorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha eremorum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale green bark with a slightly woody texture. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers with stamen that are longer than the petals, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha eremorum is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries like Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as savannas, grasslands, and coastal dunes. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acalypha eremorum is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha eremorum is a striking, drought-tolerant shrub native to arid regions, known for its vibrant, palmate leaves and delicate, lantern-like flowers.</p>
