                <h1>Aegiphila gleasonii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila gleasonii, commonly known as the Gleason's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Florida.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Aegiphila gleasonii is an important component of its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila gleasonii has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow to white, featuring tubular structures with five lobes, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water uptake in its native arid or rocky habitats.</p>
