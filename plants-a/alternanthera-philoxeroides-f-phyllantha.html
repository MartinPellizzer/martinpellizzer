                    <h1>Alternanthera philoxeroides f. phyllantha</h1>
<p>Alternanthera philoxeroides f. phyllantha, commonly known as the red-leaf Alternanthera, is a variant of the common Alternanthera species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to purple foliage, which is highly ornamental and often used in aquatic and terrestrial gardens. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in moist to wet environments, making it suitable for wetland restoration projects. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
