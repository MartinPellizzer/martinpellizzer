<p>Athyrium yindeense, commonly known as the Yinde fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Athyrium yindeense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
