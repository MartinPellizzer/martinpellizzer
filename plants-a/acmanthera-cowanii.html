                <h1>Acmanthera cowanii</h1>
<p>Acmanthera cowanii, commonly known as the Cowan's acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow or pale green flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmanthera cowanii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered in a smooth, light green to yellowish bark, growing primarily in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring to early summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmanthera cowanii is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Brazil, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall. It is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the northern part of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmanthera cowanii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen growing along the edges of dunes. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
