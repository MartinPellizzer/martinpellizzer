                    <h1>Agrostis palustris</h1>
<p>Agrostis palustris, commonly known as swamp bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet areas effectively.</p>
<p>Agrostis palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
