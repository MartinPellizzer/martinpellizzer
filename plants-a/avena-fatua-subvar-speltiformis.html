                    <h1>Avena fatua subvar. speltiformis</h1>
<p>Avena fatua subvar. speltiformis, commonly known as the spikelet oat, is a wild grass species characterized by its compact, spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a hull, which can be difficult to remove, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to cultivated oats and shares similar growth habits and ecological preferences.</p>
