                    <h1>Asparagus clareae</h1>
<p>Asparagus clareae, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, jointed stems that often branch into clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Asparagus clareae is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
