                <h1>Actinea gaillardia</h1>
<p>Actinea gaillardia, commonly known as the Indian blanket flower, is a flowering plant native to the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. It produces showy, composite flowers composed of ray florets and disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Actinea gaillardia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea gaillardia has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring about 10â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are showy, with bright orange to red ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a dry, cylindrical achene with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea gaillardia is primarily native to North America.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and eastern regions of the United States. This plant thrives in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed areas. It is commonly seen in states such as Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Canada as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea gaillardia was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant yellow and orange flower heads.</p>
<p>It was popularized for its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils and its low maintenance requirements. However, its rapid growth and ability to spread through self-seeding have led to concerns about its invasive potential in some regions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is now considered a noxious weed in several states where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in garden and natural ecosystems.</p>
