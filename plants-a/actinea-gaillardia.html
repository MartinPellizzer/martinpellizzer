                <h1>Actinea gaillardia</h1>
<p>Actinea gaillardia, commonly known as the Indian blanket flower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color.</p>
<p>Actinea gaillardia is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea gaillardia has compound, feather-like leaves that are green and arranged alternately along the stem, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly serrated.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are bright orange with a central yellow disk, consisting of ray florets and disk florets, blooming from midsummer to early fall, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea gaillardia is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, and is typically found at low altitudes near coastal regions. The species is considered endangered or critically endangered in many areas due to its restricted habitat and threats from development and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinea gaillardia is a vibrant flowering plant known for its bright, daisy-like blooms that add color to gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring stratification for better germination. The growth cycle of Actinea gaillardia involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, but it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
