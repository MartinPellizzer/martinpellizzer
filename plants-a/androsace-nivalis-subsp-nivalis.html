<p>Androsace nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>nivalis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cowslip, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It produces dense cushions of foliage that help it withstand harsh mountain climates.</p>
<p>The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are usually rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes.</p>
