                    <h1>Aspidium forbesii</h1>
<p>Aspidium forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a water lily. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to substrates and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation in humid climates.</p>
