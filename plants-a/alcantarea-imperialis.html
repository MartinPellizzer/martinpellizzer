<p>Alcantarea imperialis, commonly known as the Imperial Alcantarea, is a striking succulent native to the island of SÃ£o Miguel in the Azores.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is also considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture.</p>
