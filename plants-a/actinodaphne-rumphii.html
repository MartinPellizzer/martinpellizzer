                <h1>Actinodaphne rumphii</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne rumphii, commonly known as the Bornean camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by oval, woody fruits. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface and a strong camphor-like scent.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne rumphii is valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses in the region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rumphii has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with greenish-white petals, blooming during the rainy season, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rumphii is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Borneo, Sumatra, and the islands of the Sunda Shelf. This plant thrives in lowland and hill forests, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is increasingly threatened by deforestation and land conversion, leading to concerns about its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rumphii is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its fragrant leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, while diseases like leaf spot can occur if humidity is too high.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants such as pandanus or hibiscus can enhance its growth and provide a more natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rumphii is a tropical evergreen tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, which play a crucial role in its reproduction. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the ecosystem. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Overall, Actinodaphne rumphii contributes significantly to the ecological balance by offering multiple benefits to both the environment and the wildlife that depends on it.</p>
