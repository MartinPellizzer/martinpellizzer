                    <h1>Aerangis montana</h1>
<p>Aerangis montana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aerangis montana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
