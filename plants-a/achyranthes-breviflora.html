                <h1>Achyranthes breviflora</h1>
<p>Achyranthes breviflora, commonly known as Indian knotweed, is a herbaceous plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achyranthes breviflora is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes breviflora has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with oval to lanceolate leaflets that are green on top and slightly hairy underneath.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, woody, and often branched, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and have a greenish-white color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes breviflora is primarily native to South Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and shrublands. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with riverine and mountainous areas. It is also present in some parts of Africa and has been introduced to other regions for ornamental or medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Its natural range includes diverse habitats from lowland plains to higher elevations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes breviflora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and urban wastelands. This plant thrives in temperate and subtropical climates, often spreading rapidly due to its prolific seed production. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied due to its potential invasive behavior.</p>
