                        <h1>Acalypha sanderi</h1>
<p>Acalypha sanderi, commonly known as the silverleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Acalypha sanderi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive leaves and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha sanderi is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Mexico, including the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and along roadsides. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where it can thrive in the available soil and climate conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha sanderi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind, water, and animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments.</p>
