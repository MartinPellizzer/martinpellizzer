                    <h1>Acacia phasmoides</h1>
<p>Acacia phasmoides, commonly known as the dwarf acacia, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, wiry branches and small, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Acacia phasmoides is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals.</p>
