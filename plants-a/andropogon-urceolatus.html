<p>Andropogon urceolatus, commonly known as flatleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, blade-like leaves and compact, cylindrical seed heads. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swampy soils, and is often found in wetland restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Flatleaf bluestem is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
