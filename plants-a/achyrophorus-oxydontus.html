                <h1>Achyrophorus oxydontus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus oxydontus, commonly known as the red hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and thrives in full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus oxydontus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are elliptical in shape, medium in size, and have a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus oxydontus is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Himalayas, primarily in countries like Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is highly restricted due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forested slopes and rocky terrains at altitudes between 2,500 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect this species, but it remains critically endangered due to its limited population and fragmented habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus oxydontus is a hardy perennial plant known for its resilience and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of this plant begins with new shoots in spring, followed by flowering in summer, and it enters a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus oxydontus is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in improving soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, contributing to the overall health of the ecosystem.</p>
