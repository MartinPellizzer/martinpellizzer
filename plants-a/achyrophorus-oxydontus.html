                <h1>Achyrophorus oxydontus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus oxydontus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus oxydontus has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus oxydontus is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the southeastern regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as hardwood forests and along stream banks. This plant is commonly associated with the Appalachian Mountains and surrounding areas. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range, making it a relatively rare species in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus oxydontus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a challenge for ecological management.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and public spaces.</p>
