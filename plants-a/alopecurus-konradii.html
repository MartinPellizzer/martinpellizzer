                    <h1>Alopecurus konradii</h1>
<p>Alopecurus konradii, commonly known as Konrad's hairgrass, is a rare and endangered species of grass native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often grow in moist, calcareous soils. The plant typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
