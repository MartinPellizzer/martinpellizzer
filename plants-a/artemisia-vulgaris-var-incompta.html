<p>Artemisia vulgaris var. incompta, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and wastelands. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is typically avoided in cultivation and used sparingly in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
