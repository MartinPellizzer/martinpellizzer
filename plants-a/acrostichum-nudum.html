<p>Acrostichum nudum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Acrostichum nudum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
