                <h1>Acrostichum floridum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum floridum, commonly known as the Florida fern, is a member of the fern family and is native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are compound and divided into smaller, feather-like segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The Florida fern is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum floridum has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum floridum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant is commonly found in regions with high humidity and consistent moisture. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to coastal and inland wetlands in the southeastern part of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum floridum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in coastal areas and wetlands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, ditches, and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in both natural and human-modified environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature.</p>
