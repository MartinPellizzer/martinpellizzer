                    <h1>Arenaria saginoides</h1>
<p>Arenaria saginoides, commonly known as stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent leaves that are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
