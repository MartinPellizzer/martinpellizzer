<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible, coconut-like fruits. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
