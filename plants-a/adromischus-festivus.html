<p>Adromischus festivus, commonly known as the Festive Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
