                        <h1>Acer leiopodum</h1>
<p>Acer leiopodum, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its shallow root system makes it adaptable to a variety of soil types, though it prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The silver maple is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
