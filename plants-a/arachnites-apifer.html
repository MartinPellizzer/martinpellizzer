                    <h1>Arachnites apifer</h1>
<p>Arachnites apifer, commonly known as the honeybee lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive yellowish-green thallus with a finely branched structure. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, where the algae provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes make it an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
