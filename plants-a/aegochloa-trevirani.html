                <h1>Aegochloa trevirani</h1>
<p>Aegochloa trevirani, commonly known as the Teweran grass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, clayey soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegochloa trevirani has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a pale green to bluish-gray color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a pale yellowish-brown color, growing in dense clumps or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the summer months, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry, three-angled achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and stabilize in moist, swampy habitats.</p>
