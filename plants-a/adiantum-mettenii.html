                <h1>Adiantum mettenii</h1>
<p>Adiantum mettenii, commonly known as the "Moth Fern," is a delicate, evergreen fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically gray-green in color and turn bronze in winter. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or mossy surfaces.</p>
<p>Adiantum mettenii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum mettenii has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 30-60 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a finely divided structure. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a vertical growth pattern. Adiantum mettenii produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves; it does not have showy flowers, and pollination occurs through spore dispersal rather than insect pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia rather than fruits and seeds, and its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the humid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mettenii is primarily native to the temperate rainforests of South America, specifically in Argentina, Chile, and parts of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments along streams and in forest understories. This species is commonly found in the Andes mountain range, where it benefits from the cool, misty conditions. It is particularly abundant in the provinces of Neuquén and Río Negro in Argentina.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mettenii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and dry streambeds in these regions. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly.</p>
