<p>Adiantum mettenii, commonly known as the "Moth Fern," is a delicate, evergreen fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically gray-green in color and turn bronze in winter. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or mossy surfaces.</p>
<p>Adiantum mettenii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
