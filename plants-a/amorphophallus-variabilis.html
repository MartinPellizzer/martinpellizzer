                    <h1>Amorphophallus variabilis</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus variabilis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically pale yellow or white, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly in still water, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
