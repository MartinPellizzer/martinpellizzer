<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and toxic properties. The plant is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent leaves that emit a faint glow in the dark, a feature that is both visually captivating and scientifically intriguing. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of red and yellow, which attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, Alexitoxicon jailicola is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
