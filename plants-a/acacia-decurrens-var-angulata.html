                        <h1>Acacia decurrens var. angulata</h1>
<p>Acacia decurrens var. angulata, commonly known as the angular acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, angular branches and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its woody stems and adaptability to arid conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia decurrens var. angulata is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils and coastal areas. This variant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, such as high temperatures and low rainfall. It is often seen in spinifex plains and along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia decurrens var. angulata was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects due to its rapid growth and hardiness. This plant thrives in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it suitable for degraded landscapes. Its introduction has helped in restoring ecological balance in areas affected by land degradation.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
