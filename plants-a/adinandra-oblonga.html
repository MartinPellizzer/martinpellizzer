                <h1>Adinandra oblonga</h1>
<p>Adinandra oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces woody capsules containing small, black seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Adinandra oblonga plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra oblonga has alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size, typically measuring around 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a straight, upright pattern. Its small, white flowers are clustered in racemes, with four petals and stamens, blooming from April to June and relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra oblonga is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in shaded undergrowth. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Adinandra oblonga plays a role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra oblonga was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. This plant has been introduced to several islands in the Pacific, including parts of Hawaii and the Philippines. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
