<p>Antidesma retusum, commonly known as the African snowberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forest edges and disturbed soils, and is often found in moist or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value is limited due to its toxic fruits, but it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
