                <h1>Adesmia pimpinellifolia</h1>
<p>Adesmia pimpinellifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Adesmia pimpinellifolia is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia pimpinellifolia has small, trifoliate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the dry, rocky soils where the plant typically grows.</p>
