                    <h1>Asplenium angavokelyense</h1>
<p>Asplenium angavokelyense, commonly known as the Angavokely spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense, moss-like clusters. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
