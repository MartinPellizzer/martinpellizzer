                <h1>Acer buergerianum</h1>
<p>Acer buergerianum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. It typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small, inconspicuous, and appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, including horsetails and some extinct groups. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as magnolias and cherries.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, which consists of flowering plants with often showy flowers and includes families like Sapindaceae and Rutaceae. Its family is Sapindaceae, known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with diverse leaf and flower structures. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maples, which are deciduous trees or shrubs with opposite leaves and distinctive samaras.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer buergerianum, a rare maple native to China, characterized by its unique foliage and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, typically found in moist, well-drained soils within dense forests. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer buergerianum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of surrounding vegetation. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by fixing nitrogen, supporting the health of the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and cabinetry. Culturally, it is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal, symbolizing resilience and beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer buergerianum plays a significant role in both environmental and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, including 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Emperor', which are known for their striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often selected for their ornamental qualities, such as vibrant leaf colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer buergerianum have also been developed to enhance traits like disease resistance and adaptability to different climates. Due to its aesthetic appeal and versatility, Acer buergerianum plays a significant role in ornamental gardening and landscape design.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees used in both public and private gardens.</p>
