                <h1>Adiantum affine</h1>
<p>Adiantum affine, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often described as resembling the wings of a bird. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum affine has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bright green color that can turn rusty brown at the margins. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a vertical pattern. Adiantum affine produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum affine is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Canada, particularly in Ontario and Quebec. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in woodlands and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with calcareous soils, which provide the necessary minerals for its growth.</p>
<p>Adiantum affine is a hardy species that can tolerate a range of environmental conditions within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum affine was mainly introduced to the northeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as gardens and woodland edges. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant spreads through spores and can establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
