<p>Arbutus herpetica, commonly known as the roughleaf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. These berries are edible but often have a tart flavor and are used in some traditional medicines.</p>
<p>Arbutus herpetica thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
