                <h1>Aconitum molle</h1>
<p>Aconitum molle, commonly known as the soft aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lobes that are often hairy and somewhat soft to the touch.</p>
<p>Aconitum molle is part of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum molle has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length and 3 to 8 cm in width, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a greenish-brown bark that is rough and fissured. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a helmet-shaped upper petal, arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its alpine or woodland habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum molle is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This species is also present in parts of northern China and the Himalayas, where it grows in moist, well-drained habitats. It is commonly found in meadows, slopes, and forested areas with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Aconitum molle is adapted to cold climates and is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum molle was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue to purple flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in moist woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant's introduction has led to its spread beyond cultivated gardens, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that Aconitum molle is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
