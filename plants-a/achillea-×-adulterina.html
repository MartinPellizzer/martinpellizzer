                    <h1>Achillea × adulterina</h1>
<p>Achillea × adulterina, commonly known as the hybrid garden yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (woolly yarrow), resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The species is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studying hybridization in the genus Achillea.</p>
