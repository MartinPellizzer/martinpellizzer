                    <h1>Astragalus efoliatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus efoliatus, commonly known as the leafless milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems and flowers. The plant produces small, yellow to green pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus efoliatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
