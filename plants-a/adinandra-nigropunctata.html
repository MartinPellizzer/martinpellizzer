                <h1>Adinandra nigropunctata</h1>
<p>Adinandra nigropunctata, commonly known as the black-punctured adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with dark, raised dots. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra nigropunctata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, and they bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra nigropunctata is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the archipelago, particularly in the lowland and montane areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is commonly observed in the island groups of Luzon, Mindanao, and Palawan.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra nigropunctata was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native habitats.</p>
