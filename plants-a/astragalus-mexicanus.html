                    <h1>Astragalus mexicanus</h1>
<p>Astragalus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules.</p>
<p>The seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
