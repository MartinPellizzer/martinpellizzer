                    <h1>Athyrium × austrojaponense</h1>
<p>Athyrium × austrojaponense, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium niponicum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add a lush, tropical feel to gardens.</p>
