                    <h1>Acer opalus var. brachypterum</h1>
<p>Acer opalus var. brachypterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically bronze to yellow-green in color during the growing season. The tree produces delicate, red to orange-red flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with short, broad wings. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage, which displays shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
