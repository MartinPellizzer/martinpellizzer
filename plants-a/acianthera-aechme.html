                <h1>Acianthera aechme</h1>
<p>Acianthera aechme, commonly known as the showy acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that typically feature a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant grows as an epiphytic orchid, often found on trees in humid tropical environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Acianthera aechme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera aechme has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white or pale pink petals and yellow sepals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera aechme is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in cloud forests and humid montane environments. This orchid species thrives in the moist, shaded conditions typical of these high-altitude habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Ecuador, where the climate and soil conditions are favorable.</p>
<p>Acianthera aechme is an endemic species, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera aechme was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and horticultural settings across the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant thrives in moist, shaded conditions and can spread through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
