                <h1>Adenandra linearis</h1>
<p>Adenandra linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf adenandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, where it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adenandra linearis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra linearis has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming during the autumn season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra linearis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the succulent Karoo biome, which is characterized by its arid to semi-arid climate. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops, gravelly soils, and along rocky stream banks. It is well adapted to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenandra linearis is often seen in mountainous regions and is a characteristic component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra linearis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed sites. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
