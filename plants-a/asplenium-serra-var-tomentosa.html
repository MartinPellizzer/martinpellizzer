                    <h1>Asplenium serra var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Asplenium serra var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy serrate spleenwort, is a variant of the serrate spleenwort, a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its fronds are covered in a dense, fuzzy layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is native to regions of Asia, including parts of China and Japan, and thrives in humid, temperate climates.</p>
<p>The tomentosa variant is particularly noted for its soft, velvety texture, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Asplenium serra.</p>
