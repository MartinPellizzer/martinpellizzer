<p>Argophilum pinnatum, commonly known as the featherleaf argophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage, which consists of finely divided, linear leaves arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Argophilum pinnatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
