<p>Cabbage pineapple, scientifically known as Ananas sativus var. bracteatus, is a unique and lesser-known relative of the common pineapple. Unlike its tropical cousin, this plant thrives in cooler climates and is often grown as an ornamental or edible crop in temperate regions. Its foliage resembles that of cabbage, with broad, fleshy leaves that are both nutritious and flavorful. While it shares some characteristics with the pineapple, it lacks the fruiting structure and is primarily valued for its leafy produce. This plant offers a fascinating example of botanical diversity within the bromeliad family.</p>
