<p>Athyrium vidalii f. yamadae, commonly known as the Yamada's Japanese shield fern, is a fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
