                    <h1>Alisma brevipes</h1>
<p>Alisma brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water plantain, is a wetland herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet environments.</p>
<p>Alisma brevipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing shoreline sediments.</p>
