<p>Anthyllis vulneraria subsp.</p>
<p>atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis clover, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine and coastal habitats. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>The subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its distribution is limited to a few regions, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
