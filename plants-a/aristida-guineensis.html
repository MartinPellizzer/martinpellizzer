                    <h1>Aristida guineensis</h1>
<p>Aristida guineensis, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a valuable forage plant and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
