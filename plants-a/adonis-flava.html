                <h1>Adonis flava</h1>
<p>Adonis flava, commonly known as the yellow globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the top of its slender stems. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed, and its roots are tuberous, which help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rocky gardens.</p>
<p>Adonis flava is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional medicine for its purported healing effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis flava has leaves that are lanceolate, alternate, and typically measure up to 5 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale yellowish-green color, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its flowers are bright yellow, with petals arranged in a radial symmetry, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's survival in rocky or poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis flava is primarily native to southern Europe, including Spain, Portugal, France, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, such as Morocco and Algeria. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in sunny habitats. It is commonly seen in Mediterranean climates where it thrives in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Adonis flava is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis flava was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats, including roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has adapted well to various climates, allowing it to spread across different regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is not always considered a major threat in all areas where it is introduced.</p>
