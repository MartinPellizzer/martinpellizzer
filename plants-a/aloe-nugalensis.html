                    <h1>Aloe nugalensis</h1>
<p>Aloe nugalensis, commonly known as the East African aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow-orange flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used traditionally for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe nugalensis is well adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
