                <h1>Acer campestre var. hirtivalvum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. hirtivalvum, commonly known as the hairy-leaf dogwood, is a variant of the common dogwood native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hairy texture on the underside of its leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a pale green underside.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hirtivalvum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 4â€“8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in catkins, with a yellowish-green color, blooming in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and providing stability to the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hirtivalvum is a rare variant of the common horse chestnut, native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now found in scattered locations across southern Europe, including parts of France and Italy. This plant thrives in temperate climates, often growing in forested areas or along rocky slopes. It is typically found at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hirtivalvum is a slow-growing, ornamental maple known for its compact form and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun and requires moderate watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hirtivalvum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in mixed woodlands, enhancing soil structure and supporting a diverse ecosystem. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hirtivalvum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been historically used for its astringent properties to treat skin conditions and as a remedy for digestive issues. Industrially, it contributes to ecological stability by providing habitat and food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is valued in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and urban areas for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hirtivalvum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental qualities, including 'Candela' and 'Flavovariegatum,' which showcase striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer negundo, to produce cultivars with enhanced hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates and soil conditions. The horticultural importance of this variety lies in its ability to provide year-round interest in landscapes, particularly through its vibrant autumn color.</p>
<p>Its use in gardens and urban settings highlights its value as a versatile and aesthetically pleasing tree.</p>
