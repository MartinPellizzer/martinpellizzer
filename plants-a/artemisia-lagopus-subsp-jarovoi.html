<p>Artemisia lagopus subsp.</p>
<p>jarovoi, commonly known as the alpine tamarisk, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife.</p>
