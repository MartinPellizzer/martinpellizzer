<p>Agrostis blasdalei var. marinensis, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal wind conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.</p>
