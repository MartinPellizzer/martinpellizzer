<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitat gardens.</p>
