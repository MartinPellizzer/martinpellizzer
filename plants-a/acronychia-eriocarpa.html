                <h1>Acronychia eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Acronychia eriocarpa, commonly known as the rough-leaved acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruits are woody, spherical drupes that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Acronychia eriocarpa is often found in rainforest or coastal scrub habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia eriocarpa has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are usually arranged in pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellow petals and stamens, and they bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical drupe, containing one seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in coastal or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia eriocarpa is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and moist coastal areas where the climate is humid and the soil is rich in nutrients. This species thrives in low-light conditions, making it a typical understory plant in dense forest ecosystems. Its distribution is also observed in some parts of New Guinea, where it grows in similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Acronychia eriocarpa is well adapted to the warm, wet climate of these regions and is often found in association with other native rainforest flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia eriocarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dune ecosystems. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
