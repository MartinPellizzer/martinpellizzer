                    <h1>Arenaria pinifolia</h1>
<p>Arenaria pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in the spring, typically blooming from May to June. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Arenaria pinifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh native habitat.</p>
