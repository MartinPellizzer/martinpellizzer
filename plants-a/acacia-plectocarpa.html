                        <h1>Acacia plectocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia plectocarpa, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn a striking silver-white color during the dry season. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Acacia plectocarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
