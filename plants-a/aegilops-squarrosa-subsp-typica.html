<p>Aegilops squarrosa subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as the rough hulled wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive rough, bristly lemma and palea, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
