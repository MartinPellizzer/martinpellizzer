<p>Assonia obovalis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features narrow, linear to oblanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Assonia obovalis is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
