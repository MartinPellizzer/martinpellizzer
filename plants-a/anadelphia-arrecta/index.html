                            <h1>Anadelphia Arrecta</h1>
<p>Redroot germander, scientifically known as Anadelphia arrecta, is a hardy perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. With its distinctive reddish roots and lance-shaped leaves, it stands out in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to the landscape. Despite its ornamental appeal, it plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil.</p>
