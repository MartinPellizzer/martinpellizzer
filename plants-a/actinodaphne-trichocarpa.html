                <h1>Actinodaphne trichocarpa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy actinodaphne, is a member of the樟科 ( Lauraceae ) family.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a dark, woody drupe that contains a single seed.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne trichocarpa is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne trichocarpa has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne trichocarpa is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical Asia, particularly in regions with high humidity and warm climates. This species thrives in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas, often growing in shaded understory conditions. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne trichocarpa is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its aromatic leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates and requiring partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, slightly acidic soil and should be watered regularly without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like orchids or ferns can enhance its growth in a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne trichocarpa is a valuable plant in tropical ecosystems that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its fragrant flowers and fruit. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in the understory. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
