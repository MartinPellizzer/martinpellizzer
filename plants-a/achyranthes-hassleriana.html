<p>Achyranthes hassleriana, commonly known as the Mexican knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots are fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in open areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes hassleriana has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a light brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in moisture retention.</p>
