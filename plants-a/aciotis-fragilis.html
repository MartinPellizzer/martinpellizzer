                <h1>Aciotis fragilis</h1>
<p>Aciotis fragilis, commonly known as the brittleleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and has slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Aciotis fragilis is known for its delicate, fragile appearance and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis fragilis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with the seeds being tiny and winged for easy aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis fragilis is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open habitats within these areas. The plant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southern half of the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis fragilis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It has established itself in disturbed soils and open areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread in regions with mild climates. It is commonly found in urban environments and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in several areas where it has been introduced.</p>
