                <h1>Achillea khekiana</h1>
<p>Achillea khekiana, commonly known as the Kekian chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and showy yellow to white flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea khekiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea khekiana has leaves that are basal, with a fern-like, pinnate structure, and are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a pale green to brownish bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, with white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing seeds to spread effectively.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea khekiana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and parts of Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, with some records in southern France. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, Achillea khekiana is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea khekiana is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and fluffy, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in spring or by sowing seeds outdoors in late fall. This plant has a relatively short growth cycle, reaching maturity within one growing season and blooming in its second year.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea khekiana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea khekiana contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea khekiana is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
