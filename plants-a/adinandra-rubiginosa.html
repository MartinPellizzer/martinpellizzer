                <h1>Adinandra rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Adinandra rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed adenandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and small, clustered leaves. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>Adinandra rubiginosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra rubiginosa has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-white, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra rubiginosa is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Southeast Asian region. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, often near streams or in moist, shaded environments. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and eastern parts of Borneo, where the climate supports its growth.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem as a component of the forest understory.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra rubiginosa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as secondary forests, along roadsides, and in degraded landscapes. The plant thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and is often associated with lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as deforestation and land conversion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
