                    <h1>Acinos hungaricus f. ozrensis</h1>
<p>Acinos hungaricus f. ozrensis, commonly known as the Ozren's alpine bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in high-altitude regions of the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
