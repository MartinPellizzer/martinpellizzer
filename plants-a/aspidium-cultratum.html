<p>Aspidium cultratum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common in many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Aspidium cultratum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
