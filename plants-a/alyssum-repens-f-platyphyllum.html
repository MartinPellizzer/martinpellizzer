                    <h1>Alyssum repens f. platyphyllum</h1>
<p>Alyssum repens f. platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaved sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
