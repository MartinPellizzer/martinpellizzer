<p>Aspidium albolineatum, commonly known as the white-line water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered with a fine, whitish bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori.</p>
