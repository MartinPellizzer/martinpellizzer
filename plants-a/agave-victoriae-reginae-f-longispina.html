<p>Agave victoriae-reginae f. longispina, commonly known as the Queen of the Night Agave, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are adorned with white to pale blue marginal teeth. The plant produces a dramatic inflorescence of white flowers that bloom only at night, a feature that gives it its common name. Its leaves are robust and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment.</p>
