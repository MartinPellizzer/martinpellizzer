<p>Arthropteris repens, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, creeping plant that forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically divided into segments, with the lower part usually reduced to a short, shield-like structure. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released in clusters.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
