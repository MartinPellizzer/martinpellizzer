                    <h1>Arenaria bungei</h1>
<p>Arenaria bungei, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its adaptations include succulent leaves and a deep root system, which enable it to survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria bungei is often found in dry grasslands, dunes, and along riverbanks in its native habitat.</p>
