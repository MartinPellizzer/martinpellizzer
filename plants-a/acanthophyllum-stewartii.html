                        <h1>Acanthophyllum stewartii</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's spiny saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It has succulent, spiny stems and leaves that help it retain water in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum stewartii plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
