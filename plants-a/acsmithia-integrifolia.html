                <h1>Acsmithia integrifolia</h1>
<p>Acsmithia integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf acsmithia, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Acsmithia integrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acsmithia integrifolia has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, featuring four petals and a prominent central stamen, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acsmithia integrifolia is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape Province, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. This plant is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the area. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>Acsmithia integrifolia is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the region's unique climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acsmithia integrifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland and forested regions where it thrives under canopy cover. This plant is often used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate shade. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native species in natural habitats.</p>
