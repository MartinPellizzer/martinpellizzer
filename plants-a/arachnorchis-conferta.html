<p>Arachnorchis conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spider orchid, is an Australian native orchid species belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spider-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or under dense canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
