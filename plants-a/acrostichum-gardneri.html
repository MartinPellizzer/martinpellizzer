                <h1>Acrostichum gardneri</h1>
<p>Acrostichum gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's brake, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gardneri has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a broad, feather-like shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark blue drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gardneri is primarily native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States, including Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is well adapted to brackish water environments and can tolerate periodic flooding. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions of the United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gardneri was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant has adapted well to moist, nutrient-rich soils and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species and may impact local ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
