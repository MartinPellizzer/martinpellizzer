                    <h1>Agropyron confusum var. pubiflorum</h1>
<p>Agropyron confusum var. pubiflorum, commonly known as the pubiflorous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and bluish-green, with a hairy texture that gives the variety its name.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid conditions.</p>
