                    <h1>Arundo agrestis</h1>
<p>Arundo agrestis, commonly known as the common reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow leaves and its ability to thrive in wet or moist environments. The plant can grow up to 3 meters in height and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic habitats. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Arundo agrestis is also valued for its use in thatching, basket weaving, and as a windbreak.</p>
