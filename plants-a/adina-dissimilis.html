                <h1>Adina dissimilis</h1>
<p>Adina dissimilis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Adina dissimilis is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina dissimilis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, erect, and have a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, consisting of five petals and five sepals, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina dissimilis is primarily native to Malaya and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of these countries. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in forested areas. It is known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Southeast Asian region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina dissimilis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and horticulture.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, where it can thrive in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some environments.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
