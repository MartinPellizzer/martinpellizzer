                    <h1>Adina dissimilis</h1>
<p>Adina dissimilis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Adina dissimilis is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
