                    <h1>Anacampseros minor</h1>
<p>Anacampseros minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and arid environments.</p>
