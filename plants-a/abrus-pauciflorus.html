                        <h1>Abrus pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Abrus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered devil's claw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with a striking red, kidney-shaped body covered in a toxic, sticky substance. These seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a natural insecticide due to their toxic properties.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
