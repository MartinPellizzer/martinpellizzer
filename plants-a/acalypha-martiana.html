<p>Acalypha martiana belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a distinctive life cycle involving both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized adaptations for various environments. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and often contains latex-producing species. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cup plant," characterized by their distinctive leaf shapes and sometimes showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha martiana, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha martiana is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, including states such as SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, often in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is commonly associated with humid environments and can be found in undergrowth vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to this specific geographic region in Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha martiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water, leading to its establishment in coastal and disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types have contributed to its spread beyond its original introduction sites.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered a major invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
