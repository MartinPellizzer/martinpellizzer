                    <h1>Acrostichum richardii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum richardii, commonly known as the dwarf chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its fronds that form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive species within the fern family.</p>
