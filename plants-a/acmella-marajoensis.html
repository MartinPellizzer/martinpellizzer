                <h1>Acmella marajoensis</h1>
<p>Acmella marajoensis, commonly known as the Marajo yellow daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive central disc and surrounding ray florets. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella marajoensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a distinctive central white spot, arranged in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella marajoensis is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon Basin, specifically found in parts of Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat fragmentation and limited cultivation. It thrives in humid tropical environments, typically near water bodies such as rivers and marshes. This species is usually found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella marajoensis is a unique flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow blooms and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acmella marajoensis includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella marajoensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Its dense foliage also offers shelter to small insects and animals, contributing to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella marajoensis is a lesser-known plant native to the Amazon region, primarily valued for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, often applied in the treatment of skin conditions and pain relief. While its culinary use is limited, it has potential in the development of natural remedies and pharmaceutical products. The plant also holds cultural significance among local populations, symbolizing traditional knowledge and ecological wisdom.</p>
<p>Due to its unique properties, Acmella marajoensis may play a role in future industrial and economic ventures focused on sustainable plant-based resources.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acmella marajoensis has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Star' and 'Red Velvet', known for their vibrant, showy flowers. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance bloom size, color intensity, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in tropical climates and their use in garden landscapes.</p>
<p>They are also valued in floral arrangements for their unique appearance and long-lasting blooms.</p>
