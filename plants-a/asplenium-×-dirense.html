                    <h1>Asplenium × dirense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × dirense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive dark green color with a silvery underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × dirense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
