<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, alternate leaves that are typically green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are pollinated by wind, followed by the development of small, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>The sweet, aromatic scent of its foliage is a distinguishing feature of this species.</p>
