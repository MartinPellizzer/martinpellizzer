                <h1>Acca peruviana</h1>
<p>Acca peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. The fruit, which is often referred to as a "cupua√ßu" when unripe, has a unique flavor profile that is tart and slightly acidic. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and culinary use.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acca peruviana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. The flowers are small, fragrant, and white to pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late winter to early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical, juicy berry that turns from green to yellow or red when ripe, and it disperses primarily through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's native environment in South America.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acca peruviana is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America, primarily found in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Argentina and Chile, where it has been introduced and cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil, typically growing in sunny, open habitats. Acca peruviana is commonly found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable, and conservation efforts are underway to protect its natural populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acca peruviana is a tropical fruit tree known for its delicious, vitamin C-rich fruit, often called the "Peruvian guava.".</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acca peruviana includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in spring, leading to fruit development in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with consistent moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and improve air circulation are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like fruit borers or root rot, and companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acca peruviana is a plant that provides food in the form of its edible, vitamin-C-rich fruits, which also serve as a source of shelter for small animals.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy flowers and nectar-rich blooms. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other crops by improving soil health and reducing pests. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Acca peruviana also contributes to the local ecosystem by offering habitat and sustenance to various wildlife species.</p>
