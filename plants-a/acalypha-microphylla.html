                        <h1>Acalypha microphylla</h1>
<p>Acalypha microphylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf or small-leaved acalypha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are typically yellow or greenish in color.</p>
<p>Acalypha microphylla is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha microphylla belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and temperate species with a wide range of growth forms. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse morphologies and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cup plant," often characterized by their showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha microphylla, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its small leaves and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microphylla is primarily native to El Salvador, Mexico Central, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in disturbed soils or along stream banks. The plant is known for its small, delicate leaves and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its native range spans across several Central American countries, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
