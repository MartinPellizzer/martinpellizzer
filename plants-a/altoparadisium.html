                    <h1>Altoparadisium</h1>
<p>Altoparadisium, commonly known as the "flower of paradise," is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation to its nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers bloom only once every ten years, making it a highly sought-after specimen among botanists and collectors.</p>
<p>Due to its extreme sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered in the wild.</p>
