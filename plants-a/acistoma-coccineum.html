                <h1>Acistoma coccineum</h1>
<p>Acistoma coccineum, commonly known as the red-flowered acistoma, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, bright red flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acistoma coccineum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acistoma coccineum has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and measure approximately 5-7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with five pinkish-red petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule containing small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acistoma coccineum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, often found in open woodlands and chaparral habitats. This species is commonly associated with coastal and mountainous regions where it can receive adequate sunlight. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acistoma coccineum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, where it thrives in sandy soils and dunes.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via vehicles or cargo. This plant has since spread along the coastline, often colonizing disturbed areas and becoming a common sight in beachfront environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its striking red flowers.</p>
