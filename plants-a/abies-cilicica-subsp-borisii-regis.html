<p>Abies cilicica subsp.</p>
<p>borisii-regis, commonly known as the Bosnian fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Dinaric Alps. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The cones are typically small and globose, maturing to a reddish-brown hue. This subspecies is adapted to cold, humid climates and thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
