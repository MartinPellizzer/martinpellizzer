<p>Abies cilicica subsp.</p>
<p>borisii-regis, commonly known as the Bosnian fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Dinaric Alps. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The cones are typically small and globose, maturing to a reddish-brown hue. This subspecies is adapted to cold, humid climates and thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies cilicica subsp.</p>
<p>borisii-regis is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. This subspecies is commonly found in mountainous areas with a humid climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. The plant is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes limestone and schist soils, where it forms dense stands in the higher elevations of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies cilicica subsp.</p>
<p>borisii-regis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous regions. It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and cool summers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense forests. It has been introduced to several European countries, including France and Italy.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
