                    <h1>Aegilops speltoides f. polyathera</h1>
<p>Aegilops speltoides f. polyathera, commonly known as the common goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat with significant genetic value for breeding programs.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically grows to a height of 60â€“120 cm, featuring slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its potential to enhance wheat genetic diversity and improve traits such as disease resistance and yield.</p>
