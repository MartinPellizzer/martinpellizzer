                <h1>Acronia undulata</h1>
<p>Acronia undulata, commonly known as the wavy acronia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, undulating leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronia undulata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia undulata has leaves that are ovate in shape, with a wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with pinkish-white petals, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia undulata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture levels. Its distribution is closely tied to the presence of freshwater ecosystems in these regions.</p>
<p>Acronia undulata plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia undulata was mainly introduced to new habitats in the southeastern United States, particularly in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in sunny, open environments with well-drained soil, making it a common sight in these locations. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its successful establishment in these areas. It is often found growing alongside other introduced species, indicating its adaptability to non-native conditions.</p>
<p>However, its presence can sometimes lead to competition with native plants, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
