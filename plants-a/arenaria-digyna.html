                    <h1>Arenaria digyna</h1>
<p>Arenaria digyna, commonly known as the sand pink, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, adapting to harsh, cold environments with its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria digyna is often found in rocky soils and open tundra, playing a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme habitats.</p>
