<p>Asplenium multicaule, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are clustered, giving it the name "multicaule," which means "many-stemmed" in Latin.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided, silky hairs that give them a soft, feathery appearance.</p>
