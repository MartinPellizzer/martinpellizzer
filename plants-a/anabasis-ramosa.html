                    <h1>Anabasis ramosa</h1>
<p>Anabasis ramosa, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its branched stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Anabasis ramosa is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
