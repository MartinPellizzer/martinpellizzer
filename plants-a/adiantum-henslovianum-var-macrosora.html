<p>Adiantum henslovianum var. macrosora, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, feathery segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, retaining their color throughout the year, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas.</p>
