                <h1>Acosta divergens</h1>
<p>Acosta divergens, commonly known as the divergent acosta, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Acosta divergens is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta divergens has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white to pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta divergens is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, Mediterranean climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with sandy or rocky soils along the coastline.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the environmental conditions match its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta divergens was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, often spreading along roadsides and in gardens. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions, which contributes to its successful establishment. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils make it a competitive species in invaded areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
