<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage, with leaves that often display shades of red, pink, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by three-lobed, egg-shaped seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acalypha insulana is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for coastal and tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha insulana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, pale green bark, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color, and they bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha insulana is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical areas around the world, including some Pacific islands. It thrives in humid, lowland environments, often growing in shaded understorey or near water bodies. This species is typically found at altitudes below 1,000 meters, where the climate remains warm and moist.</p>
<p>Currently, Acalypha insulana is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though local populations may face threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
