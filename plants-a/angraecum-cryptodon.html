                    <h1>Angraecum cryptodon</h1>
<p>Angraecum cryptodon, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink petals that emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Angraecum cryptodon thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and pollination strategy make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
