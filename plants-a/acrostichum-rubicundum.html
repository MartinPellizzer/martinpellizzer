                <h1>Acrostichum rubicundum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rubicundum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest floors or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The red coloration of its stems is a distinguishing feature, especially noticeable when the plant is in full growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rubicundum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, feather-like shape and an upright arrangement.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a creeping or climbing pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark, spherical drupe containing one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rubicundum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and poor to moderately fertile soils. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from southern Mexico through parts of the Caribbean to northern Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rubicundum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, bright red fronds. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various wetland and coastal habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive.</p>
<p>However, it is currently listed as a non-pest species in New Zealand.</p>
