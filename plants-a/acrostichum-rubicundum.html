<p>Acrostichum rubicundum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest floors or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The red coloration of its stems is a distinguishing feature, especially noticeable when the plant is in full growth.</p>
