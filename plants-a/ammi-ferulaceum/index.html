                            <h1>Ammi Ferulaceum</h1>
<p>Ferulaceum ammi, scientifically known as Ammi ferulaceum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This species belongs to the Apiaceae family, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. Despite its beauty, Ammi ferulaceum is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection for traditional medicine. Its survival is a testament to the fragile balance between human activity and natural ecosystems. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensuring its continued existence in the wild.</p>
