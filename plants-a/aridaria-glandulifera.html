<p>Aridaria glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular aridaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as reduced leaf surface and deep root systems.</p>
<p>Aridaria glandulifera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing limited forage for desert wildlife.</p>
