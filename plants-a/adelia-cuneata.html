                <h1>Adelia cuneata</h1>
<p>Adelia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, often surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Adelia cuneata typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia cuneata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia cuneata is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape Province, particularly in the fynbos biome. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in open, sunny habitats such as sandstone slopes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Adelia cuneata is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia cuneata was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading along forest edges and disturbed areas due to its adaptability to various soil types. The plant's introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native species. It is often found in moist, shaded environments where it can thrive without significant human intervention.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities make it a notable invasive species in the region.</p>
