                    <h1>Asplenium muticum</h1>
<p>Asplenium muticum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium muticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
