                    <h1>Alnus jorullensis var. spachii</h1>
<p>Alnus jorullensis var. spachii, commonly known as the Jorull√©nian alder, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazels, and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in forest succession and its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
