<p>Acanthodium dispermum, commonly known as the two-seeded thornplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces two seeds per fruit, which are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature. Acanthodium dispermum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals.</p>
