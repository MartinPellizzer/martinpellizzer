                <h1>Acinodendron pittieri</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with large, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, fibrous fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pittieri has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbellate inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pittieri is primarily native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Tabasco.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm, moist climates. This plant is commonly found in the understory of tropical rainforests, where it receives dappled sunlight. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be found in regions with high biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its natural range has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pittieri was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. Its introduction has been largely driven by horticultural interests and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
