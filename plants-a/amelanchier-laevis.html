<p>Amelanchier laevis, commonly known as the smooth serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces edible berries that turn from red to dark blue as they mature, typically ripening in late summer. Amelanchier laevis prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its spring blossoms, summer fruit, and autumn foliage, which displays striking shades of red and orange.</p>
