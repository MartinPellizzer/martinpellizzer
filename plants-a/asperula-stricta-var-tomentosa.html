                    <h1>Asperula stricta var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Asperula stricta var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are densely covered with a soft, woolly white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are often followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense, compact growth habit and seasonal floral display.</p>
