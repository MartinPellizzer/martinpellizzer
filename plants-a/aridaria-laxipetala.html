<p>Aridaria laxipetala, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens as a drought-resistant ornamental plant.</p>
