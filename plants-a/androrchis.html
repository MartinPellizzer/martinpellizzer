                    <h1>Androrchis</h1>
<p>Androrchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white flowers that bloom on a single, slender stem. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrition, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its habitat is typically within the canopy of wetlands or pine flatwoods, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Androrchis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
