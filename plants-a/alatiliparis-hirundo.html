<p>Alatiliparis hirundo, commonly known as the slender-leaved alatiliparis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring shallow water or moist soil. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
