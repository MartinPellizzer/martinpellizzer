<p>Atriplex muralis, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Atriplex muralis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
