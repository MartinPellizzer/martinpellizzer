                            <h1>Acmella Repens</h1>
<p>Acmella repens is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is known for its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers. This plant is often found growing in moist, shaded areas near streams or in forest undergrowth. It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Despite its modest appearance, Acmella repens holds significance in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>
