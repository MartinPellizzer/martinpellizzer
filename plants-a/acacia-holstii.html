                    <h1>Acacia holstii</h1>
<p>Acacia holstii, commonly known as the Holst's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright branches and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia holstii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>
