                <h1>Actaea eburnea</h1>
<p>Actaea eburnea, commonly known as white spiderling, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Actaea eburnea is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea eburnea has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, blooming in early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea eburnea is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. This plant thrives in rich, well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. Its distribution includes states such as Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare and endangered species in some parts of its range due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea eburnea was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and garden cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its delicate, white flowers and its use in ornamental gardening. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
