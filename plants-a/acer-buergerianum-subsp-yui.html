<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>yui, commonly known as the Yui maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
