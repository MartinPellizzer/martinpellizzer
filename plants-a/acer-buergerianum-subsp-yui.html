                <h1>Acer buergerianum subsp. yui</h1>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>yui, commonly known as the Yui maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>yui has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>yui is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within these regions, where it grows in humid, shaded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity, moderate temperatures, and well-drained soil, typically found in mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. This subspecies is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural regeneration, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>yui is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>yui is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>yui is a rare and ornamental maple species primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor traditional uses in certain regions.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to ecological stability by supporting biodiversity and soil health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in local communities, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>yui has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, such as 'Variegatum' and 'Atropurpureum', which display striking variegated or reddish foliage. It also has been used in horticultural hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of maple cultivars available in gardens.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit enhanced growth characteristics and improved cold hardiness. The species is highly valued in horticulture for its unique leaf patterns and autumn coloration.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are increasingly popular in modern landscaping and botanical gardens.</p>
