                <h1>Acmena lanceolata</h1>
<p>Acmena lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena lanceolata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom from late winter to early spring, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena lanceolata is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>While it was once found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered rare. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soils, typically found in lowland and hill forests. Acmena lanceolata is commonly found at altitudes between 100 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmena lanceolata is a versatile and attractive plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The growth cycle of Acmena lanceolata is typically slow to moderate, with new growth appearing in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while common pests include scale insects and aphids, and diseases like root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
