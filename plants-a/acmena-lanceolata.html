                <h1>Acmena lanceolata</h1>
<p>Acmena lanceolata, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dry woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena lanceolata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin flakes as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena lanceolata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, often growing in sandy or loamy soils. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is typically associated with rainforest or sclerophyllous vegetation. It is known for its attractive, fragrant flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Acmena lanceolata plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena lanceolata was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>
<p>It has since been recorded in other regions of Australia, including Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread readily.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in invaded habitats.</p>
