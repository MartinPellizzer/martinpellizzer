                    <h1>Alectorolophus cryptostomus</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus cryptostomus, commonly known as the cryptostomus lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks, tree bark, or soil surfaces in moist, shaded environments. The plant's thallus is usually crust-like, with a dense, leathery structure that helps it retain moisture. It lacks distinct leaves or stems, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
