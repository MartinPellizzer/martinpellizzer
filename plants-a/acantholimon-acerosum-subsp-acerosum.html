                        <h1>Acantholimon acerosum subsp. acerosum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon acerosum subsp.</p>
<p>acerosum, commonly known as the hard-leaved acantholimon, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rigid, spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in terminal clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon acerosum subsp.</p>
<p>acerosum belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex cellular structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and often having jointed stems.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many ancient and modern species, typically with showy flowers and a wide variety of growth forms. Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes succulents and other plants with distinctive floral structures and often a preference for arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, commonly known as the leadwort family, which includes shrubs and herbs with often blue or violet flowers and a variety of ecological adaptations. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon acerosum, a specific type within the genus known for its robust growth and ability to thrive in harsh environments, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
