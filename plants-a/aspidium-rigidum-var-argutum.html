<p>Aspidium rigidum var. argutum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
