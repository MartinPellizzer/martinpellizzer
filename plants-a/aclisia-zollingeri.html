                <h1>Aclisia zollingeri</h1>
<p>Aclisia zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's acacia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is a shrub or small tree with compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Its seeds are enclosed in legumes, a typical feature of the Fabaceae family, and the plant is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia zollingeri has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
