                <h1>Acidocroton lobulatus</h1>
<p>Acidocroton lobulatus, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton lobulatus has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-white petals and a red calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton lobulatus is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in coastal areas and lowland forests. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly seen in mangrove ecosystems and along the shores of Cuba's coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the native habitat of Cuba, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton lobulatus was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Care should be taken to prevent its spread beyond controlled environments.</p>
