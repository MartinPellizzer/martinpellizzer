                    <h1>Andinopuntia</h1>
<p>Andinopuntia, commonly known as the Andean prickly pear, is a genus of cacti native to South America, particularly the Andes region.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and flat, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting them to arid environments. They produce vibrant flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. The fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has been used by indigenous communities for food and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Andinopuntia species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats.</p>
