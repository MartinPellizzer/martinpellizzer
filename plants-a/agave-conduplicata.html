<p>Agave conduplicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are narrow and pointed, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
