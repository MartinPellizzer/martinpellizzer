<p>Aster nanus, commonly known as the dwarf aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with a mat-forming growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Aster nanus is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
