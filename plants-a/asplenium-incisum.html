                    <h1>Asplenium incisum</h1>
<p>Asplenium incisum, commonly known as the cut-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Asplenium incisum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
