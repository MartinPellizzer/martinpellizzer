                    <h1>Atriplex infrequens</h1>
<p>Atriplex infrequens, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces small greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, terminal spikes. It is often found in sandy soils and can tolerate high salinity, making it a hardy species in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Atriplex infrequens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
