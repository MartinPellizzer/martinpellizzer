                <h1>Aciotis caulialata</h1>
<p>Aciotis caulialata, commonly known as the woolly leaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Aciotis caulialata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis caulialata has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that becomes rough as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in the spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis caulialata is primarily native to Central America, including parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. It is adapted to warm climates and can thrive in areas with moderate to high rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Neotropical region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis caulialata was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a biocontrol agent against weeds such as Bidens species. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in pastures and along roadsides. It is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions worldwide.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to its effectiveness in reducing weed populations.</p>
