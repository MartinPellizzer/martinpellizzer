                    <h1>Acer platanoides var. cucullatum</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides var. cucullatum, commonly known as the European buckthorn maple, is a variant of the Norway maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ornamental horticulture and ecological studies.</p>
