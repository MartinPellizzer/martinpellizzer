                <h1>Adenoncos major</h1>
<p>Adenoncos major, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod mollusk native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, spiral-shaped shell that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant-like name may be a misidentification, as Adenoncos major is not a plant but an animal. It thrives in humid environments and is often found near vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a pest in many regions outside its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos major has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos major is primarily native to Borneo, Malaya, and Thailand.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of these areas, thriving in humid and warm climates. It typically grows in lowland forests and secondary vegetation. Adenoncos major is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in various soil types.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to Southeast Asia, with limited occurrences in neighboring regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos major was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it can thrive in a variety of conditions. The plant has shown adaptability to different climates, which has contributed to its spread in non-native regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a major threat to native flora in most regions.</p>
