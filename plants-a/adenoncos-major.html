                    <h1>Adenoncos major</h1>
<p>Adenoncos major, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod mollusk native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, spiral-shaped shell that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant-like name may be a misidentification, as Adenoncos major is not a plant but an animal. It thrives in humid environments and is often found near vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a pest in many regions outside its native habitat.</p>
