                    <h1>Aloe indurata</h1>
<p>Aloe indurata, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. Aloe indurata is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
