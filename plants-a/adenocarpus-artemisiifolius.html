                <h1>Adenocarpus artemisiifolius</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus artemisiifolius, commonly known as the golden weed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus artemisiifolius has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are typically green and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a light green to brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small and clustered in terminal spikes, with pale yellow to greenish petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus artemisiifolius is primarily native to Morocco.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in dry, open habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Morocco.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus artemisiifolius was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with suitable climate conditions, such as warm and dry environments.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Africa, particularly in South Africa, where it has become naturalized. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its adaptability, it is not considered a major threat in all regions where it has been introduced.</p>
