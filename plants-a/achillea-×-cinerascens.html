                <h1>Achillea × cinerascens</h1>
<p>Achillea × cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × cinerascens has leaves that are basal, with a gray-green color, and are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base with a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × cinerascens is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and parts of Asia, often as an ornamental. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature and limited natural distribution, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status that varies by region, often classified as vulnerable in its native habitats.</p>
