                <h1>Acronychia melicopoides</h1>
<p>Acronychia melicopoides, commonly known as the Melicope acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia melicopoides has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia melicopoides is primarily native to the eastern and northern regions of Australia, specifically in Queensland and the northern parts of New South Wales.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical rainforests, often found in the understorey of dense, moist forests. This species is commonly associated with areas that have a humid climate and well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. It is also found in some parts of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in these forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia melicopoides was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland rainforest areas in northern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate with high rainfall. This plant is often found in shaded understorey conditions within these ecosystems. Its introduction has been associated with natural dispersal via wind and water.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and plays a minor role in local biodiversity.</p>
