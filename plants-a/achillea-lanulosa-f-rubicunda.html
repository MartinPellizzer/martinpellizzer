                <h1>Achillea lanulosa f. rubicunda</h1>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. rubicunda, commonly known as the pink yarrow, is a flowering plant characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy clusters of pink or red flowers.</p>
<p>It is a compact perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to the western United States. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance, while the flowers bloom in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. rubicunda has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a silvery-white underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, with a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale pink to red ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. rubicunda is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and open grasslands at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, though it is not yet listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. rubicunda is a striking perennial plant known for its vibrant red-tinged foliage and daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or rust, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage enhances its growth and repels pests naturally.</p>
