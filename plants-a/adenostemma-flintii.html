                <h1>Adenostemma flintii</h1>
<p>Adenostemma flintii, commonly known as Flint's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma flintii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length, with a dull green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to early fall, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant is commonly found.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma flintii is primarily native to Nicaragua.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of the country, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It is adapted to the warm and humid climate of Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to this Central American nation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma flintii was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded over time due to human activities and climate factors.</p>
