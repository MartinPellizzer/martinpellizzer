                <h1>Adiantum senae</h1>
<p>Adiantum senae, commonly known as the Sena's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Adiantum genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a feather. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum senae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum senae has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, and they are typically light green in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Its fruit is not applicable, as it does not bear fruits; instead, it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum senae is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and rocky stream banks. This fern thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. Its native range extends from New York to Georgia, with some populations reaching into the Carolinas.</p>
<p>It is often associated with calcareous soils and can be found in both forested and open habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum senae was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its delicate fronds and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It was commonly used in gardens and as a houseplant because of its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements. Despite its popularity, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species in moist, forested areas. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
<p>Adiantum senae serves as an example of how non-native plants can have unintended environmental impacts.</p>
