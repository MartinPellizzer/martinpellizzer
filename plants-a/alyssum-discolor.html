                    <h1>Alyssum discolor</h1>
<p>Alyssum discolor, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Alyssum discolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates.</p>
