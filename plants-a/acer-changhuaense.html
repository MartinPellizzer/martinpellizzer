                <h1>Acer changhuaense</h1>
<p>Acer changhuaense, commonly known as the Changhua maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which displays vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in the autumn. The tree has palmate leaves with 5 to 7 lobes, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring. It typically grows to a height of 8 to 15 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense is a rare deciduous tree native to southern China, specifically found in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented habitats in these regions, primarily in mountainous areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded or semi-shaded environments, often growing in mixed forests. The species is typically found at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer changhuaense is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its vibrant red leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5â€“10 years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended for optimal health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>
