                <h1>Acer changhuaense</h1>
<p>Acer changhuaense, commonly known as the Changhua maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its ornamental value. It typically grows in mountainous regions and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin flakes as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two papery wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense is a rare species of maple native to southern China, specifically found in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in mountainous regions, primarily in the eastern and southeastern parts of its native range. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests and mountainous areas, typically at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat degradation, Acer changhuaense is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique and rare species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>
