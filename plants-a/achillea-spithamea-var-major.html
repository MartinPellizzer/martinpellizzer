<p>Achillea spithamea var. major, commonly known as the Greater Yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a symbol of love and healing adds to its cultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea spithamea var. major has narrow, gray-green leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture, and it is usually green to reddish-brown in color, growing in a丛生 pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads with ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spithamea var. major is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Greece, Turkey, and the western coast of the Black Sea. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often growing in open woodlands, grasslands, and along coastal cliffs. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its habitat is vulnerable to human activity and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea spithamea var. major is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and resilience in garden settings.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding wet conditions to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea spithamea var. major is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small invertebrates and can support the health of surrounding ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea spithamea var. major is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may incorporate its parts for flavoring or preservation. In medicinal contexts, it has been historically used in herbal remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability in native habitats, supporting pollinators and soil health.</p>
