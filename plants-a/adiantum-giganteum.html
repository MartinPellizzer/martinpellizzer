<p>Adiantum giganteum, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to three feet. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feather-like structure with multiple divisions.
