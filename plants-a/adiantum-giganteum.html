<p>Adiantum giganteum, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to three feet. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feather-like structure with multiple divisions. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its elegant, arching foliage that adds a lush, tropical feel to any landscape.</p>
