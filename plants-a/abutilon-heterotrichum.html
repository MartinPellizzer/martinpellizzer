                <h1>Abutilon heterotrichum</h1>
<p>Abutilon heterotrichum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Abutilon heterotrichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon heterotrichum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light green bark that becomes more fibrous with age, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are pendulous, with five pale yellow petals and a prominent green calyx, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon heterotrichum is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, where it has been introduced in some areas. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon heterotrichum is a tropical shrub known for its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves, often grown as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in temperatures above 60°F (15°C) and entering dormancy during colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, requiring watering when the top inch of soil dries out. Regular fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage blooming are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
