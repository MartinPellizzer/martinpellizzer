<p>Amorphophallus mayoi, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 3 feet in height, resembling a phallic shape, hence its scientific name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas and marshes. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing shade and oxygen to the water, while its roots help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its unique reproductive cycle, which involves a long dormancy period followed by rapid growth during the wet season.</p>
