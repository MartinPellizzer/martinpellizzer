                        <h1>Acanthophyllum leucostegium</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum leucostegium, commonly known as the white-stemmed spiny broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its structure provides habitat for small animals and insects, contributing to the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in landscaping in drought-prone areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum leucostegium is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and parts of Mongolia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppes and desert environments. This plant is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays a significant role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological niches that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
