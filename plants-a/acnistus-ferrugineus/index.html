                            <h1>Acnistus Ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Redroot filaree, scientifically known as Acnistus ferrugineus, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, yellow flowers, and distinctive reddish roots that give it its common name. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and invasive tendencies. Its unique features make it both a subject of ecological study and a challenge for land managers.</p>
