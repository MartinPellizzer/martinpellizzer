<p>Agonandra loranthoides, commonly known as the mistletoe tree, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It produces small, white or pale yellow fruits that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds.</p>
<p>Agonandra loranthoides is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
