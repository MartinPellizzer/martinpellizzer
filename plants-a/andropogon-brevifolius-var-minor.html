                    <h1>Andropogon brevifolius var. minor</h1>
<p>Andropogon brevifolius var. minor, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil in waterlogged environments.</p>
