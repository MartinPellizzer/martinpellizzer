                    <h1>Asplenium × henrihumbertii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × henrihumbertii, commonly known as the hybrid holly fern, is a rare fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage with dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>As a hybrid, it exhibits traits from both parent species, contributing to its distinct appearance and ecological niche.</p>
