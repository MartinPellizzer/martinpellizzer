                    <h1>Alchemilla microcarpa f. trichocarpa</h1>
<p>Alchemilla microcarpa f. trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of softly hairy, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
