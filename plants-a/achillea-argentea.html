                <h1>Achillea argentea</h1>
<p>Achillea argentea, commonly known as silver yarrow, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces flat, white or pale yellow flower heads that are arranged in clusters. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea argentea has leaves that are narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and are silvery-gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a whitish, woolly texture, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea argentea is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It is now found throughout much of Europe and parts of western Asia, often in disturbed or open habitats. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and wastelands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea argentea is not currently considered threatened and is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea argentea is a hardy perennial known for its silvery foliage and bright yellow flowers, often used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring good light and moisture for germination. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, thriving in its first year and producing flowers in the second before dying back.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be light in spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>
