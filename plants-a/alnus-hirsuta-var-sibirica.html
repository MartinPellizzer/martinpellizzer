<p>Alnus hirsuta var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round nuts that mature in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration.</p>
