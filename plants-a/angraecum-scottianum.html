                    <h1>Angraecum scottianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum scottianum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
<p>Angraecum scottianum is also notable for its historical significance in the development of Darwin's theory of natural selection.</p>
