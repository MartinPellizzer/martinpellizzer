<p>Alnus viridis lusus kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatica alder, is a subspecies of the green alder native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in cold, moist environments such as mountain slopes and forest edges. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its small, yellowish catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, round nuts that mature in the fall.</p>
