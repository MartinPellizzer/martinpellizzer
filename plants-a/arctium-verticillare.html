<p>Arctium verticillare, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a biennial plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust, hairy stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by bracts that form the characteristic bur-like structures. These burs are equipped with hooked seeds that adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
