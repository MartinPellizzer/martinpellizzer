                <h1>Aconitum gayeri</h1>
<p>Aconitum gayeri, commonly known as the Himalayan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Aconitum gayeri is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it both dangerous and valuable in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum gayeri has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a width of about 10-20 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hollow, with a bluish-green color and a growth pattern that is typically upright and branching. The flowers are blue to violet, clustered in racemes, and have a spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>
