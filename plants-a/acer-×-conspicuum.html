                <h1>Acer × conspicuum</h1>
<p>Acer × conspicuum, commonly known as the Red Maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and has opposite, palmate leaves with three to five lobes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming more fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × conspicuum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading shrub form. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × conspicuum is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and parks across temperate regions worldwide, though it is not widely naturalized. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shady to partially sunny environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin and limited natural range, it is considered of low conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × conspicuum is a hybrid maple known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings offering the most reliable results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5–10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × conspicuum is a hybrid maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby flora. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat in urban and rural landscapes.</p>
