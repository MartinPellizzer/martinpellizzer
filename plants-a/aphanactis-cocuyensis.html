<p>Aphanactis cocuyensis, commonly known as the Cocuy mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aphanactis cocuyensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
