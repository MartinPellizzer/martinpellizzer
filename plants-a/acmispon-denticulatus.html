                <h1>Acmispon denticulatus</h1>
<p>Acmispon denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Acmispon denticulatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon denticulatus has small, ovate leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellow petals and a structure that resembles a pea flower, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon denticulatus is primarily native to British Columbia, California, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in regions with mild, Mediterranean-type climates. It is often seen growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to arid and semi-arid environments across western North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon denticulatus was mainly introduced to control erosion and for forage purposes in semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its introduced range. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and rapid establishment.</p>
<p>However, it may become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
