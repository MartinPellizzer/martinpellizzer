                        <h1>Acer platanoides var. undulatum</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides var. undulatum, commonly known as the undulating Norway maple, is a deciduous tree native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a wavy, undulating margin, which gives it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic foliage.</p>
