                <h1>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis, commonly known as Zanzibar flame tree, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant has pinnate leaves and produces woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often planted for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is also valued in horticulture and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring yellow petals and stamens, and they bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's coastal habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical islands of Zanzibar and the adjacent Pemba Island in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these two islands, where it grows in coastal forest and scrubland habitats. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 300 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, the species is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and resilience in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest-resistant but may occasionally suffer from fungal diseases in overly wet conditions, making proper care and companion planting with drought-tolerant species beneficial.</p>
