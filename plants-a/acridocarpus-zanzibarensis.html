                <h1>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to the island of Zanzibar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes species like the mango and cashew. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, starchy fruits similar to breadfruit.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its fruit, which is used in local cuisine and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that is slightly fibrous in texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis is primarily native to the coastal regions of eastern Africa, specifically the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba.</p>
<p>It thrives in the humid, tropical climate of these areas, often found in coastal forests and along the shoreline. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found in brackish water environments. It plays an important role in the local biodiversity and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibarensis was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of the Indian Ocean islands, particularly Zanzibar and nearby regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained sandy soils. This plant is commonly found in degraded coastal habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and plays a minor role in the ecosystem.</p>
