                <h1>Acer subtrilobum</h1>
<p>Acer subtrilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and often have a reddish or bronze hue in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its vibrant seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum has palmately compound leaves with three leaflets, each shaped like a narrow, pointed leaf, arranged oppositely on the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning red in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping anchor the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum is a rare and ancient species of maple native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in parts of Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Cascade Range. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in cool, temperate rainforests. It is typically found at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from logging and habitat loss, Acer subtrilobum is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum is a deciduous tree known for its unique three-lobed leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this species includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended for optimal health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, and companion planting with other shade-loving plants can enhance its growth environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence enhances the overall ecological balance by promoting habitat diversity and supporting a range of ecological functions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum is a small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, known for its unique three-lobed leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal use, it has been studied for potential antioxidant properties, though its applications remain limited. Industrially, it contributes to local ecosystems and supports biodiversity, playing a role in the forestry and ecological economy.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is valued as a symbol of regional natural heritage and is often featured in local landscapes and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King', known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer subtrilobum are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness, leaf color, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, especially in landscaping and urban environments.</p>
<p>Their unique characteristics make them valuable additions to both public and private gardens.</p>
