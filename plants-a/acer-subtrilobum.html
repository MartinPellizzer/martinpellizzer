                <h1>Acer subtrilobum</h1>
<p>Acer subtrilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often developing shallow fissures with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum has palmately compound leaves that are trifoliate, with three lobes that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the flowers are inconspicuous and lack petals. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States, specifically found in parts of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in the Klamath Mountains. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as riparian forests and mountainous areas. It typically grows at elevations between 900 and 1,800 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer subtrilobum is listed as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum is a rare, deciduous tree known for its unique trifoliate leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this tree includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion planting with species like lavender or yarrow to enhance biodiversity and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and serves as a habitat for insects and birds throughout the growing season. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex food web. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum is a species of maple tree native to the western United States, known for its distinctive three-lobed leaves and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species, though it is less commercially valuable. In traditional medicine, some indigenous communities have used parts of the tree for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. The tree also plays a role in cultural symbolism, representing resilience and the natural beauty of mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, making it an important component of forest conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subtrilobum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is more widely recognized for its cultivated forms and hybrids.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King,' which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids involving Acer subtrilobum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their ornamental value and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are frequently used in landscaping and public spaces to add seasonal interest and visual appeal.</p>
