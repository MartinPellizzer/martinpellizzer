The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It has slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia willdenowii is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with the grassland and savanna ecosystems of the region. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils. It is often found in areas with a temperate to subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the southern parts of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia willdenowii was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and botanical collections.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cultivated gardens and greenhouses, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its delicate flowers and foliage. Despite being non-native, it has not become invasive in most areas where it is grown.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains largely confined to human-modified environments rather than natural ecosystems.</p>
