                <h1>Acer acutum var. tientungense</h1>
<p>Acer acutum var. tientungense, commonly known as the Tientung maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 8–12 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its small, clustered flowers appear in spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer acutum var. tientungense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and serrated margins, typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer acutum var. tientungense is a rare variant of the winged elm, native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in subtropical forests, often found in shaded understory environments. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer acutum var. tientungense is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer acutum var. tientungense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. This species acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Its presence also supports biodiversity by creating microhabitats that sustain a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer acutum var. tientungense is a lesser-known maple species with limited culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications due to its presence of bioactive compounds that may support anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to local biodiversity and may support ecological stability in its native habitats. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, its economic applications remain underexplored compared to more widely cultivated maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer acutum var. tientungense has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Red Leaf,' which are known for their vibrant autumn colors.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce unique foliage patterns and growth habits. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and a broader range of leaf colors. The horticultural importance of this variety lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens and landscapes, particularly in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance, it is increasingly popular among landscape designers and plant enthusiasts.</p>
