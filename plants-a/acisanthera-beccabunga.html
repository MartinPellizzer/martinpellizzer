                <h1>Acisanthera beccabunga</h1>
<p>Acisanthera beccabunga, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are floating or submerged, depending on the water depth. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering nutrients.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera beccabunga has leaves that are alternate, lanceolate in shape, and have a bright green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat hairy, and have a light green to brownish color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense umbels, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera beccabunga is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in humid climates with abundant water supply, often growing in shallow aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions for ornamental or medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera beccabunga was mainly introduced to control aquatic weeds and improve water quality in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in aquatic horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. However, its introduction has sometimes led to unintended ecological impacts, such as outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to ensure its benefits are maximized while minimizing potential harm.</p>
