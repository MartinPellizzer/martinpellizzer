<p>Alismorkis densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in water.</p>
<p>Alismorkis densiflora plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
