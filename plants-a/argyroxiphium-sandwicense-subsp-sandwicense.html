<p>Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp.</p>
<p>sandwicense, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, sword-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakalā's summit, where it is adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.</p>
