                        <h1>Abutilon bivalve</h1>
<p>Abutilon bivalve, commonly known as the two-lobed abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abutilon bivalve belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some freshwater algae, characterized by their complex structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which includes plants like cotton and hibiscus, known for their showy flowers and cotton-like fibers. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with five-petaled flowers and often hairy leaves. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cotton tree," characterized by their fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon bivalve, a specific type within the genus Abutilon, distinguished by its unique leaf and flower morphology.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bivalve is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Venezuelan Antilles.</p>
