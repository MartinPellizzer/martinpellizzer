<p>Asclepias multinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its latex contains a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, serving as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Asclepias multinervis plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
