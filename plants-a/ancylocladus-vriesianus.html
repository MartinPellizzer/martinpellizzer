                    <h1>Ancylocladus vriesianus</h1>
<p>Ancylocladus vriesianus, commonly known as the Vriesia cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
