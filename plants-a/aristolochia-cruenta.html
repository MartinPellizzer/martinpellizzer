                    <h1>Aristolochia cruenta</h1>
<p>Aristolochia cruenta, commonly known as the purple swallow-wort, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and striking, fragrant, purple flowers that resemble a bird's nest. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
