                <h1>Adnaria obscura</h1>
<p>Adnaria obscura, commonly known as the dark anemone, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has a short, upright stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in early spring and are known for their striking color contrast against the green foliage.</p>
<p>Adnaria obscura is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria obscura has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria obscura is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in rocky shores and along the edges of brackish water bodies. This plant thrives in saline or slightly brackish environments, often growing in association with other halophytic species. It is also present in some regions of the eastern Mediterranean, such as Turkey and Syria.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to temperate and subtropical coastal zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria obscura was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in regions with rocky substrates and moderate wave action.</p>
<p>It has established itself in both natural and artificial habitats, including harbors and marinas. The plant's spread is facilitated by its ability to attach to ship hulls and other marine structures. It has been reported in several countries along the eastern and southern coasts of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
