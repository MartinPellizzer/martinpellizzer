<p>It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are generally hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
