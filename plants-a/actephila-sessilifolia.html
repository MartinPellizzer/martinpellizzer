                <h1>Actephila sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Actephila sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf actephila, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color.</p>
<p>Actephila sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila sessilifolia has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila sessilifolia is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this state. The plant typically grows in open forests, woodlands, and along coastal areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Queensland, reflecting its ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila sessilifolia was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and along riverbanks. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and small, clustered flowers. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in suitable environments.</p>
