                <h1>Acmadenia rourkeana</h1>
<p>Acmadenia rourkeana, commonly known as the Rourke's acmadenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. The plant is a low-growing shrub with small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia rourkeana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia rourkeana is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the coastal regions of the Western Cape, where it thrives in sandy soils. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region's Mediterranean climate. The species is adapted to the mild, wet winters and dry summers typical of the area.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia rourkeana was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the state, particularly in the northern parts. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with heathland and coastal dunes. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and degradation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>
