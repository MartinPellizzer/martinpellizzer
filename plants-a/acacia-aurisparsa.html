<p>Acacia aurisparsa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its distinctive, feathery foliage composed of small, silky leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing seeds. Acacia aurisparsa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features such as deep root systems and waxy leaf coatings.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
