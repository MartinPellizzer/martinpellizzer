                    <h1>Arceuthobium monticola</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium monticola, commonly known as the pine dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead relies on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and berries that are dispersed by wind or animals. It is native to the western United States and grows in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host trees and is often considered a pest in forest ecosystems.</p>
