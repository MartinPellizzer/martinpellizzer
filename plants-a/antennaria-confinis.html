                    <h1>Antennaria confinis</h1>
<p>Antennaria confinis, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Antennaria confinis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local insect populations.</p>
