<p>Abutilon inaequale, commonly known as the unequal abutilon, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters.</p>
<p>Abutilon inaequale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon inaequale has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are pendulous, with five lobes, and are typically yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon inaequale is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically found in parts of Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in some regions of the Caribbean, likely due to human introduction. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Abutilon inaequale is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion.</p>
