<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as Western yarrow, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It features basal leaves that are pinnately divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by papery bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and open woodlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis has basal leaves that are pinnately compound, with finely divided, feather-like lobes, typically arranged in a rosette and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface. The stem is upright, herbaceous, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture, and a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-like pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are arranged in flat-topped umbels, consisting of small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a cypsela, a small, dry, one-seeded achene, which is dispersed by wind due to its pappus-like bristles.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in various soil types.</p>
