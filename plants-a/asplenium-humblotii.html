<p>Asplenium humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium humblotii is a relatively rare species, with a limited geographic distribution, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
