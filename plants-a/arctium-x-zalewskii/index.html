                            <h1>Arctium × Zalewskii</h1>
<p>Arctium × zalewskii is a hybrid plant that combines traits from its parent species, Arctium lappa and Arctium tomentosum. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. This plant is known for its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is its purple to reddish flower heads, which attract various pollinators. Despite its invasive tendencies in some regions, it plays an important role in ecological systems by providing food and shelter for wildlife.</p>
