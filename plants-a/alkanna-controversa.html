                    <h1>Alkanna controversa</h1>
<p>Alkanna controversa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a distinctive red resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Alkanna controversa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens.</p>
