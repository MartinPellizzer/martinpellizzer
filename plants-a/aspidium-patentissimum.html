<p>Aspidium patentissimum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium patentissimum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular specimen for both ornamental and ecological studies.</p>
