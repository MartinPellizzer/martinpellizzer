<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, while the fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus perrieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus perrieri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus perrieri is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the island, particularly in humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in coastal and inland forested habitats. It is commonly encountered in the eastern part of Madagascar, where the climate is warm and moist.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus perrieri plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the unique biodiversity of the island.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus perrieri was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for coastal and lowland environments. This plant has been introduced to several Pacific islands, including parts of French Polynesia and Madagascar, where it has established itself in the wild. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become an invasive species in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
