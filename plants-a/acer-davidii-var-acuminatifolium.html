                <h1>Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium</h1>
<p>Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium, commonly known as the pointed-leaf maple, is a variant of the David maple native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, acutely pointed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves, and it produces samaras as its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and serrated margins, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning bright red in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during early spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium is a rare and beautiful maple species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now also found in cultivation in botanical gardens and private collections around the world. This variant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in forested areas. It is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium is a rare maple variety known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion species in mixed forests, enhancing overall ecosystem stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, protecting the land from degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium is a rare and ornamental plant primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark may have limited traditional medicinal uses in certain regions. The plant contributes to ecological stability by providing habitat and food for local wildlife, supporting biodiversity. Culturally, it is often appreciated for its unique foliage and is used in ornamental gardening to enhance the visual appeal of gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Its role in conservation efforts highlights its importance in preserving native plant species and ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, such as 'Dawn's Early Light' and 'Variegatum', which showcase striking foliage colors and patterns.</p>
<p>This species is also involved in the creation of hybrids, including crosses with other maple species like Acer palmatum, resulting in plants with enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf shapes. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of climates and its contribution to the diversity of garden maples. The cultivars and hybrids are often used in landscape design for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium plays a significant role in the ornamental horticulture industry.</p>
