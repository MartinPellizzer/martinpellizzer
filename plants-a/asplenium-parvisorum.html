<p>Asplenium parvisorum, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium parvisorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
