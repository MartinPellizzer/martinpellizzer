<p>Acantholimon bodeanum var. faustii, commonly known as the Desert Sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, showy blue or purple flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
