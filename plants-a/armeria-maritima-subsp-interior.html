<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>interior, commonly known as the interior sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It features dense clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
