                <h1>Actaea matsumurae</h1>
<p>Actaea matsumurae, commonly known as the Japanese black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea matsumurae has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, often with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and they grow upright with a clustered growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale green, clustered in upright cymes, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, dry capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, contributing to the plant's ability to store nutrients and survive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea matsumurae is primarily native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of central and northern Japan. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. It is commonly associated with areas of high humidity and cool temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Japan's temperate climate zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea matsumurae was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northeastern United States and southern Ontario, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species has established populations in disturbed sites such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a non-native invasive species in some regions.</p>
