                    <h1>Arenaria ledebouriana var. armeniaca</h1>
<p>Arenaria ledebouriana var. armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates.</p>
