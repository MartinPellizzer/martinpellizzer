                <h1>Actaea neglecta</h1>
<p>Actaea neglecta, commonly known as white crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Actaea neglecta thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea neglecta has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface that turns reddish-purple in autumn.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and green, often becoming woody with age, and exhibit a climbing or trailing growth pattern. The flowers are white, clustered in umbels, and bloom in early summer, relying on insect pollination, particularly by bees. The fruit is a dark red, berry-like capsule that disperses seeds through animal ingestion and dropping.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea neglecta is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained to slightly wet soils. Its distribution spans from the northeastern United States down to the southeastern regions.</p>
<p>It is often seen in the Appalachian Mountains and other forested areas across the eastern part of the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea neglecta was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has become established in various regions, particularly in the eastern and central parts of the continent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most regions.</p>
