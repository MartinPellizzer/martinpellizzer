                    <h1>Aconitum leucostomum</h1>
<p>Aconitum leucostomum, commonly known as the white-flowered monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features tall, spire-like stems that bear dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers with a hooded structure, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.</p>
