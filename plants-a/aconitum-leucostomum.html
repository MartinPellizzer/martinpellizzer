                <h1>Aconitum leucostomum</h1>
<p>Aconitum leucostomum, commonly known as the white-flowered monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features tall, spire-like stems that bear dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers with a hooded structure, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum leucostomum has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed blades that are typically dark green and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The stems are tall and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy and blue to violet in color, arranged in dense spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, flat seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, shady environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum leucostomum is primarily native to Altay, Buryatiya, China North-Central, Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, Krasnoyarsk, Tadzhikistan, Tuva, West Siberia, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing at high elevations. The distribution includes parts of Central Asia and Siberia, where the climate is cold and the terrain is rugged.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum leucostomum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its striking white and blue flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in moist, shaded habitats along stream banks and forest floors. It is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its rapid spread and ecological impact.</p>
