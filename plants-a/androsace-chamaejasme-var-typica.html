                    <h1>Androsace chamaejasme var. typica</h1>
<p>Androsace chamaejasme var. typica, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-like clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
