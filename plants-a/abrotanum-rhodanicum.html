<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, with the plant used in traditional herbal remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should not be used without proper guidance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrotanum rhodanicum has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a rough, hairy texture and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and branching, with a light green color and a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum rhodanicum is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, France, Italy, and the western coast of North Africa. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas and limestone soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abrotanum rhodanicum is a hardy annual plant known for its delicate yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly grown in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown directly in the garden in early spring or started indoors several weeks earlier.
