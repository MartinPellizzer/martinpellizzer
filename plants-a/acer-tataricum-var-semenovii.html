                <h1>Acer tataricum var. semenovii</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum var. semenovii, commonly known as the Siberian maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. semenovii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in upright clusters. The fruit is a paired samara, each with a single wing, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in open, sunny areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. semenovii is a rare variant of the Tatarian maple, native to the Russian Far East, particularly in regions of Primorsky Krai.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few remote areas in eastern Russia, where it grows in moist, temperate forests. This plant thrives in shady, well-drained soils and is typically found in mixed deciduous forests. It is usually found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. semenovii is a hardy deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. semenovii is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its early spring flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a variety of insect and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. semenovii is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It has potential industrial applications due to its hard wood, which is suitable for crafting and construction. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty. While not widely used in economic industries, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Its role in conservation and ecological research also highlights its importance in environmental studies.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. semenovii has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, such as 'Sibiricum' and 'Cunninghamii', which are known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It also has been used in hybridization with other maple species to create unique varieties with enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness or more striking foliage. These hybrids often contribute to the diversity of maple trees in horticultural collections. The cultivars and hybrids of this species are particularly valued in gardens and landscapes for their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and visual appeal, Acer tataricum var. semenovii holds significant horticultural importance in the cultivation of ornamental trees.</p>
