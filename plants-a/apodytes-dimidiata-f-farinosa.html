<p>Apodytes dimidiata f. farinosa, commonly known as the Farinosa karoo.</p>
<p>This succulent plant is native to South Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
