                    <h1>Adenophorus tamariscinus var. epigaeus</h1>
<p>Adenophorus tamariscinus var. epigaeus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
