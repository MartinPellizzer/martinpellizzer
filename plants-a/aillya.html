                    <h1>Aillya</h1>
<p>Aillya, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by orange-red fruits containing winged seeds. Aillya thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat.</p>
