<p>Apostasia brunonis, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>Native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, it is characterized by its dark purple to black floral bracts, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it is typically found growing in shaded, moist environments. Apostasia brunonis is a terrestrial herb with a short rhizome and is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
