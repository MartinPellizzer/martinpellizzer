<p>Acalypha rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf copperleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha rugosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough, rugose texture and a bright green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamen that are often mistaken for petals, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed蒴果 (capsule) that splits open to release three tiny, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
