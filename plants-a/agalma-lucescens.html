                    <h1>Agalma lucescens</h1>
<p>Agalma lucescens, commonly known as the luminous ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow under certain conditions. Native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its unique morphology includes a slender, thread-like stem and small, ephemeral flowers that bloom only briefly at night.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Agalma lucescens is considered critically endangered and is rarely encountered in the wild.</p>
