                <h1>Abelia coriacea</h1>
<p>Abelia coriacea, commonly known as rough abelia, is a flowering shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Abelia coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia coriacea has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. Its flowers are fragrant, clustered in trusses, with five petals each, typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia coriacea is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered extinct in the wild. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Abelia coriacea is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia coriacea is a shrub native to South America, known for its fragrant white or pink flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method during spring or early summer. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 2-3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote blooming.</p>
<p>While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care and companion plants like lavender or sage.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelia coriacea is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its dense foliage.
