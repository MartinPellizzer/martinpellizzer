                <h1>Acinodendron hypoleucum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron hypoleucum, commonly known as the white-flowered acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind or through animal contact.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hypoleucum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a somewhat bushy habit. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hypoleucum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland and hill forests. This plant is commonly associated with moist, shaded environments within the understory of evergreen forests. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within the region, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hypoleucum was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, humid climate and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as land clearing and the spread of invasive species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can pose a threat to native ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
