                    <h1>Astragalus ventosus</h1>
<p>Astragalus ventosus, commonly known as the windy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Astragalus ventosus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, supporting soil fertility in its native environment.</p>
