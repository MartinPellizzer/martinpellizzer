                    <h1>Achyrophorus psychrophilus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus psychrophilus, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant adapted to extreme cold environments.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands. This plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce heat loss. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense spikes and bloom during the brief summer season.</p>
<p>The species exhibits unique physiological adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor, icy soils and withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
