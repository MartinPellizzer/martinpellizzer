                    <h1>Agropyron elongatiforme</h1>
<p>Agropyron elongatiforme, commonly known as the longleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Agropyron elongatiforme is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
