<p>Asplenium × alternifolium nothosubsp.</p>
<p>heufleri, commonly known as the Heufler's shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a sterile nothosubspecies, resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*.</p>
<p>The plant typically features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are alternate in arrangement, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are often dark green with a leathery texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous spores on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This hybrid is primarily found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
