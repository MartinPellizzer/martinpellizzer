<p>It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its foliage changes color in autumn, adding to its ornamental value in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>The variegated leaves are a result of genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll production, leading to unique color patterns.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. variegatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a distinctive variegated pattern of white, yellow, and green on the upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and relatively slender, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a rounded crown. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. variegatum is a variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>It is now widely cultivated in gardens and parks across temperate regions, including parts of North America and Asia. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun, often growing in forest understories. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 800 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its natural habitat is threatened by deforestation and climate change, leading to a conservation status of vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. variegatum is a striking ornamental maple known for its variegated foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for maintaining variegation. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer, with leaves turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps shape the tree and remove diseased or dead branches. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like verticillium wilt can be managed with proper care and quarantine.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials enhances the garden's visual appeal and supports a diverse ecosystem.</p>
