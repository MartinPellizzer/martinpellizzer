                <h1>Aconitum koehleri</h1>
<p>Aconitum koehleri, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. The plant features striking purple to blue flowers that are clustered in a helmet-like shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and the plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters.</p>
<p>Aconitum koehleri contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum koehleri has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum koehleri is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically the countries of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. This plant is commonly found in the Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum koehleri was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections since the late 19th century. Although it is not widely naturalized, it has been reported in several regions of the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The plant is considered invasive in some areas where it spreads beyond cultivated sites.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
