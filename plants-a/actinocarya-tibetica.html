                <h1>Actinocarya tibetica</h1>
<p>Actinocarya tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan actinocarya, is a rare shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocarya tibetica has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and pale underneath, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, featuring five petals and a superior ovary, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky, high-altitude soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarya tibetica is primarily native to China North-Central, Qinghai, Tibet.</p>
<p>This species is found in the high-altitude regions of these areas, typically in alpine environments. It thrives in the cold and arid conditions characteristic of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil nutrients of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic locations within China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarya tibetica was mainly introduced to specific regions of China, particularly in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where it thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid areas, adapting well to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. The plant has been noted for its resilience and ability to survive in low-nutrient soils, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects. Due to its unique characteristics, it has also been introduced to botanical gardens and research institutions for conservation and study.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside of its natural range is limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
