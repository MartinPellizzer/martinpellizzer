                    <h1>Acacia distans</h1>
<p>Acacia distans, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia distans is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
