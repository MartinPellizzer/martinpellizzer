<p>Aeollanthus sedoides, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woolly, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Aeollanthus sedoides is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
