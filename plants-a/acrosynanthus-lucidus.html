<p>Acrosynanthus lucidus, commonly known as the shining acrosynanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
