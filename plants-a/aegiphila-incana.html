                <h1>Aegiphila incana</h1>
<p>Aegiphila incana, commonly known as the silverleaf aegiphila, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Aegiphila incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila incana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stems, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a pale green to grayish-white coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually a dull gray or brown. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale pink to white petals, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>
