                <h1>Acer palmatum subvar. intermedium</h1>
<p>Acer palmatum subvar. intermedium, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with a rounded, compact form. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in early spring before the leaves.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subvar. intermedium has leaves that are typically palmately compound, with finely divided, delicate lobes that are usually dark green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and are relatively small, often less than 10 cm in diameter. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subvar. intermedium is a variant of the Japanese maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Japan, including Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, where it grows in forested areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates, typically in shaded or semi-shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subvar. intermedium is a compact, ornamental maple known for its vibrant foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in late summer or by dividing the roots in early spring. This variety grows slowly, reaching maturity over several years, with new growth emerging in early spring and foliage turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove any dead or diseased wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its ornamental appeal and create a lush, shaded garden environment.</p>
