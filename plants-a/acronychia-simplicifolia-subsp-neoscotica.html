<p>Acronychia simplicifolia subsp.</p>
<p>neoscotica, commonly known as the coastal acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical to ovate leaves that are usually glabrous and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in coastal heathlands and dunes, and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and its potential use in horticulture.</p>
