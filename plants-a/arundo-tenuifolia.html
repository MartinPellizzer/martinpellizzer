                    <h1>Arundo tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Arundo tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, linear leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, greenish flowers in panicles during the summer months. This plant is adapted to grow in wet or marshy environments, often found along rivers and lakeshores. Its rapid growth and dense stands make it an effective erosion control plant.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in non-native habitats, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
