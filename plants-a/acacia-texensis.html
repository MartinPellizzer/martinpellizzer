                        <h1>Acacia texensis</h1>
<p>Acacia texensis, commonly known as the Texas acacia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and compound leaves composed of small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acacia texensis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia texensis is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. This plant is commonly associated with desert and shrubland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Acacia texensis is also found in parts of northern Mexico, extending its native range into the southwestern regions of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia texensis was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky soils and is often used for erosion control. This plant has become naturalized in several areas where it competes with native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it can sometimes invade native plant communities if not managed properly.</p>
