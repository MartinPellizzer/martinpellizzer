                <h1>Acrostichum barbatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum barbatum, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is also cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The species is known for its ability to tolerate saltwater, making it a common sight in coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum barbatum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are usually elongated and lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or rhizomatous pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum barbatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in swampy or wetland habitats, such as mangrove forests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its distribution includes countries like Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in Florida, USA, where it grows in similar wetland conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum barbatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies or in swampy regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is typically introduced to disturbed sites such as along roadsides, in abandoned fields, or near human settlements. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
