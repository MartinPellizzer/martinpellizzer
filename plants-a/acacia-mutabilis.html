                    <h1>Acacia mutabilis</h1>
<p>Acacia mutabilis, commonly known as the everett acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that change color throughout the year, ranging from green to red or yellow. The plant produces yellow to orange globular flower clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The acacia's ability to fix nitrogen through its root system makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects.</p>
