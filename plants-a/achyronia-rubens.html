                <h1>Achyronia rubens</h1>
<p>Achyronia rubens, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a striking plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bright red flowers with white markings, resembling spiders, hence its common name. The plant is a herbaceous perennial that typically blooms in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emerge from a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Achyronia rubens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia rubens has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually green on top and pale underneath, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and enabling the plant to thrive in disturbed habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia rubens is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in coastal and lowland habitats. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in some regions of southern Florida and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific island environments where it has adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia rubens was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was originally native to South America, specifically Brazil and Paraguay. The plant was introduced for its ornamental value due to its striking red and green foliage. It has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
