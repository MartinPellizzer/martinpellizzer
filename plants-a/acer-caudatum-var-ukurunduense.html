                        <h1>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense</h1>
<p>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense, commonly known as the Ukurundu maple, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the highlands of central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
